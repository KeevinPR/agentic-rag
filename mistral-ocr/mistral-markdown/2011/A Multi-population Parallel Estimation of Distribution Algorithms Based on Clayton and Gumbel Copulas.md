#### Abstract

The idea of multi-population parallel strategy and the copula theory are introduced into the Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA), and a new parallel EDA is proposed in this paper. In this algorithm, the population is divided into some subpopulations. Different copula is used to estimate the distribution model in each subpopulation. Two copulas, Clayton and Gumbel, are used in this paper. To estimate the distribution function is to estimate the copula and the margins. New individuals are generated according to the copula and the margins. In order to increase the diversity of the subpopulation, the elites of one subpopulation are learned by the other subpopulation. The experiments show the proposed algorithm performs better than the basic copula EDA and some classical EDAs in speed and in precision.


Keywords: multi-population, parallel, estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), copula theory, Clayton, Gumbel.

## 1 Introduction

The Estimate of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) are new Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) combined Genetic Algorithms (GAs) with statistical learning. EDAs realize population evolution by iteratively estimating probabilistic model of selected population which describes the solutions distribution from a macroscopic perspective, and then sampling the new individuals from the model. The probabilistic model reflect the relationship between variables, therefore EDAs are effectively used to obtain optimized solutions for complex problems [1]. Currently, many kinds of EDAs were studied by scholars. The classical algorithms are: (1) PBIL [2] and UMDA [3] ,in which the variables are independent; (2) MIMIC[4] and BMDA[5], which only consider the dependences between pairs of variables; (3) ECGA[6], FDA[7] and BOA[8], which accept the multivariate correlation; (4) UMDAc[9], PBILc[10] and EMNA [11], which focus on EDAs in continuous search spaces, etc. Estimating probabilistic model is the key step in EDAs, with the problem and model become

more and more complex, the consumption of algorithm in runtime and storage space will be increased.

Copula theory becomes the hotspot in the areas of statistics and finance .In this theory, the joint probability distribution function is divided into their one-dimensional marginal distribution functions and a copula function. And the joint probability distribution function is an effectual tool to mirror the relationship between variables. Therefore, the complexity of EDAs and operation time of modeling and sampling will decrease by using of copula. Some authors present new EDAs based on copula theory (copula EDAs), and make some incipient activities [12], [13]. The main idea of copula EDAs is that firstly, select dominant population, and then modeling the marginal distribution functions from them and sampling from a copula function.

The copula function plays an important role in copula EDAs. There are two classes of copulas to express the multivariate correlations: Elliptical copulas and Archimedean copulas. Elliptical copulas include Gauss-copula and t-copula. Archimedean copulas are produced from different generators according to the definition of Archimedean copula [14]. About 200 kinds of Archimedean copulas are currently being developed, in which Clayton, Gumbel and Frank are famous and in regular use. Every copula has special characteristic. Existing copula EDAs estimate the dependence structure of variables using an pre-assigned copula function, in which neither discuss the population whether exactly obeys the distribution modeled by this copula nor measure this copula function whether can fully describe the dependence structure of variables.

To deal with early convergence of traditional EDAs and single representation of relationship between variables in copula EDAs, we propose a multi-population parallel EDA based on copula theory in this paper. This algorithm optimizes more quickly and effectively than traditional EDAs and copula EDAs.

# 2 A Brief Introduction of Parallel Genetic Algorithms 

The parallel Genetic Algorithms (pGAs) are the improved algorithms for traditional GAs. They either have inherently parallelism of GAs or have high-speed performance of parallel computer, so the global searching ability of the pGAs is improved and premature convergence is overcome availably.

There are three main types of pGAs: (1) global single-population master-slave GAs, (2) single-population fine-grained GAs, (3) multiple-population coarse-grained GAs[15]. We are going to focus on the coarse-grained model because it has stronger suitability and wider utility. According to the coarse model, the overall population is distributed over multiple subpopulations and occasionally allows the migration or exchange of some individuals among the different subpopulations. Therefore, each subpopulation executes an independent algorithm. The migration strategy of coarsegrained contains some parameters [16]: (1) How often (in generations) is information sent? It is configured with migration frequency. (2) How many individuals migrate each time? It is configured with migration rate. (3) What information is selected to migrate? It is configured with information selection. (4) How are the incoming information and the local algorithm state combined? It is configured with acceptance policy. (5) Which island sends information to which other? It is configured with migration topology.

# 3 Contribution 

In this paper, a new copula EDA named multi-population parallel copula EDA is presented.

### 3.1 Multi-population Parallel Copula EDA

According to the framework of copula EDA [12], the copula EDA is an iterative run containing three main steps. The first step is to select a subpopulation denoted by $\mathrm{x}=\left\{x^{i}=\left(x j^{i}, x z^{i}, \ldots x_{n}{ }^{i}\right), j=1,2, \ldots, s\right\}$. The second step is to estimate the margins $F_{i}$ for each random variable $X_{i}, i=1,2, \ldots, n$ according to the samples $\left\{x_{i}^{j}, j=1,2, \ldots, s\right\}$. The last step is to select or to construct a copula $C$ according to $x$, and then sample from $C$. Assuming the sampled vectors are $\left\{u^{(k)}=\left(u_{1}^{(k)}, u_{2}^{(k)}, \ldots, u_{n}^{(k)}\right), k=1,2, \ldots, l\right\}$, the new individuals $\left\{\boldsymbol{x}^{(k)}=\left(x_{1}^{(k)}, x_{2}^{(k)}, \ldots, x_{n}^{(k)}\right), k=1,2, \ldots, l\right\}$ can be calculate3d by using

$$
x_{i}^{(k)}=F_{i}^{-1}\left(u_{i}^{(k)}\right), i=1, \ldots, n, k=1, \ldots, l
$$

where, $F_{i}{ }^{j}$ is the inverse function of the $i$ th marginal distribution function.
copula EDA replaces some old individuals of the original population with the new generated individuals and progresses the new evolution until the terminate condition is met.

Fig. 1. The flow chart of multi-population parallel copula EDA

Some authors have studied on the optimization effectiveness of different copula functions under the framework of copula EDA [17],[18]. The results show that in many cases, the different copulas are used in common basic test function to bring about

different performances, because each copula function has special characteristic. So modeling and sampling by a pre-assigned single copula function without judgment is difficult to exactly describe the multivariate correlation of practical problem.

In order to possibly speed up the search of EDAs and to increase the diversity of the population, the idea of parallel Genetic Algorithms is introduced into copula EDA. Multi-population parallel copula EDA separates the individuals into certain independent subpopulations. According to the frame work of copula EDA, each subpopulation use different copulas to model and sample, respectively. We choose two famous Archimedean copulas: Clayton and Gumbel. The sampling algorithm from copula is the algorithm proposed by Marshall and Olkin[19], [20].

Concluding the analysis presented above, the multi-population parallel copula EDA works as Figure 1 and Algorithm 1, where, the procedure Clatyton sample and Gumbel sample is shown in Algorithm 2 and Algorithm 3 respectively.

# 3.2 Clayton Copula Model Sampling 

The generator of Clayton copula is

$$
\varphi(t)=\left(t^{-b}-1\right) / \theta
$$

the inverse function is

$$
\varphi^{-1}(t)=(1+\theta t)^{-1 / \theta}
$$

and the inverse Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the generator $\varphi^{-1}$ is

$$
\mathcal{L} S\left(\varphi^{-1}\right)=F(v)=\frac{(1 / \theta)^{1 / \theta}}{\Gamma(1 / \theta)} e^{-v / \theta} \cdot v^{1 / \theta-1}
$$

The algorithm for sampling from Clayton copula and empirical margins is concluded as in Algorithm 2.

Algorithm 2. $\left(x_{1}^{(k)}, x_{2}^{(k)}, \ldots, x_{n}^{(k)}\right)=\operatorname{Calyton} \_$sample $(k)$
Step1.Simulate $v \sim F(v)=\frac{(1 / \theta)^{1 / \theta}}{\Gamma(1 / \theta)} e^{-v / \theta} \cdot v^{1 / \theta-1}$.
Step2.Simulate i.i.d. $v_{i} \sim \mathrm{U}[0,1], i=1, \ldots, n$, get $u_{i}$ from

$$
u_{i}=\varphi^{-1}\left(\left(-\log v_{i}\right) / v\right)=\left(1-\frac{\theta \log v_{i}}{v}\right)^{-1 / \theta}
$$

Step3.Get new individual $\left(x_{1}^{(k)}, x_{2}^{(k)}, \ldots, x_{n}^{(k)}\right)$ by calculating

$$
x_{i}^{(k)}=F_{i}^{-1}\left(u_{i}\right)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}
\operatorname{rand}\left[x_{i}^{\langle j\rangle}, x_{i}^{\langle j\rangle}\right) & \text { if } \quad\left[u_{i} \times x\right]=j \quad \text { and } x_{i}^{\langle j\rangle} \neq x_{i}^{\langle j\rangle}
\end{array}\right.
$$

# 3.3 Gumbel Copula Model Sampling

$$
\varphi(t)=(-\ln t)^{\theta}
$$

and the algorithm for sampling from Gumbel copula and empirical margins is described in Algorithm 3.
Algorithm 3. $\left(x_{1}^{(k)}, x_{2}^{(k)}, \ldots, x_{n}^{(k)}\right)=$ Gumbel_sample $(k)$

Step4. Compute $Z \sim s t(\alpha, \beta, 1,0)$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
Z & =\frac{\sin \alpha\left(\theta_{0}+\Theta\right)}{(\cos \alpha \theta_{0} \cos \Theta)^{1 / \alpha}}\left[\frac{\cos \left(\alpha \theta_{0}+(\alpha-1) \Theta\right)}{W}\right]^{\left.\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}\right|} \alpha \neq 1 \\
Z & =\frac{2}{\pi}\left[\left(\frac{2}{\pi}+\beta \Theta\right) \tan \Theta-\beta \ln \left(\frac{\frac{\pi}{2} W \cos \Theta}{\frac{\pi}{2}+\beta \Theta}\right)\right] \quad \alpha=1
\end{aligned}
$$

Step5.Compute $v \sim s t(\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta):$

$$
\begin{aligned}
v=\gamma Z+\delta & \alpha \neq 1 \\
v=\gamma Z+\left(\delta+\beta \frac{2}{\pi} \gamma \ln (\gamma)\right) & \alpha=1
\end{aligned}
$$

Step6. Simulate i.i.d. $v_{i} \sim \mathrm{U}[0,1], i=1, \ldots, n$, get $u_{i}$ from

$$
u_{i}=\phi^{-1}\left(\left(-\log v_{i}\right) / v\right)=\left(1-\frac{\theta \log v_{i}}{v}\right)^{-1 / \theta}
$$

Step7.Get new individual $\left(x_{1}^{(k)}, x_{2}^{(k)}, \ldots, x_{n}^{(k)}\right)$ by calculating

\operatorname{rand}\left[x_{i}^{<j>}, x_{i}^{<j+1>}\right) & , x_{i}^{<j>} \neq x_{i}^{<j+1>} \\
\operatorname{rand}\left(x_{i}^{<j>} ; \delta\right) & x_{i}^{<j>}=x_{i}^{<j+1>}
\end{array}\right.
\end{aligned}
$$

# 4 Experiments 

### 4.1 Experimental Design

Test Function. To carry out theÃ¯validation of the proposed algorithm in this paper, we have selected four benchmark functions in Table 1. $\mathrm{F}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{F}_{2}$ can easily produce illposed covariance matrices; $\mathrm{F}_{3}$ is a multi-peak function; $\mathrm{F}_{4}$ is an uni-model function. All of the functions above with the different characteristics are also used in [21].

Initial Population. Because the accuracy of the estimated model and the quality of offspring will decrease as population size decreases, the population size should not too small. For the proposed algorithm, population size is set to 2000, and equally divided into two subpopulations as certain strategy. The dimension of the search space is 10 . In order to ensure the fairness of comparison, all the algorithms to participate comparison share common populations. In addition, selection rate of the promising population is 0.5 that truncation selection and roulette selection are $30 \%$ and $70 \%$ of total selection respectively.

Parallel Algorithm Model. The coarse-grained model is used in this paper. Migration topology is unidirectional ring, migration rate and frequency is 0.2 and 5 , respectively.

Parameters of Copula Function. The parameter $\theta$ of Gumbel is set to 1.05 in Gumbel copula EDA and multi-population parallel copula EDA; the parameter $\theta$ of Clayton is set to 1 in Clayton copula EDA and multi-population parallel copula EDA.

# 4.2 Results Analysis 

Using $F_{1}-F_{4}$ test multi-population parallel copula EDA, MIMIC ${ }_{c}{ }^{G}$, UMDA ${ }_{c}{ }^{G}$, Gumel copula EDA and Clayton copula EDA 50 times respectively, and the evolutionary generation is 150 . The experimental results are shown in Table 2. The evaluation criterions are: the mean fitness, the standard variance and the minimal fitness of the 50 optimization results, the average runtime of the 50 optimization.

From the experimental results in table 2, we know that multi-population parallel copula EDA performs well in $F_{1}-F_{3}$ where multivariate correlations are strong. $\mathrm{MIMIC}_{c}{ }^{\mathrm{G}}$ and $\mathrm{UMDA}_{\mathrm{c}}{ }^{\mathrm{G}}$ have good performances in $F_{4}$ where variables are independent.

To sum up, facing problems of Ã¬multivariate strong correlations, UMDA ${ }_{c}{ }^{G}$ converges very fast and does not converge to the global optimum because the algorithm considers the relationships of the optimized variables as independent, $\mathrm{MIMIC}_{c}{ }^{G}$ considers the pairwise correlations of the optimized variables, but it consumes much time to get a

little better optimization result. Multi-population parllal copula EDA considers the entire relationships of the optimized variables and converges to an acceptable optimized result in a short time. $\overline{\mathrm{t}}$

# 5 Conclusions 

EDAs have effective performance for complex optimization problem by estimating probabilistic distribute model which reflect the dependent relationship of variables in the population. The copula EDAs provides an alternative way to tackle the drawbacks which are modeling complexity, high time consuming and poor performance on problems with strong correlation of variables in traditional EDAs. Multi-population parallel copula EDA joins the idea of parallel GAs with copula EDA. The global population is divided into several independent subpopulations. Each subpopulation takes evolution on different copula under the frame work of copula EDA. And for the purpose of enriching diversity of population and enhancing overall searching ability,

the migration of some individuals among the different subpopulations is allowed under given conditions. The experimental results validate this algorithm.

The initialization and division mechanism for population and the way for multipopulation parallel working influence the performance of multi-population parallel copula EDA. The next target is to study how to select a copula function exactly fitting the subpopulation.
