      "ground_truth": "In high-dimensional personalized search problems, memory constraints for storing probability models in EDAs can be addressed through several methods.  One approach is to use simplified probabilistic models that require less memory, such as assuming independence between variables.  Another technique involves dimensionality reduction methods, like feature selection or principal component analysis, to reduce the number of variables in the model. Furthermore, distributed or parallel computing architectures can be employed to distribute the memory load across multiple machines. Finally, approximation techniques, such as using sparse matrix representations or data compression, can help in efficiently storing and manipulating the probability models within the given memory limits.",
