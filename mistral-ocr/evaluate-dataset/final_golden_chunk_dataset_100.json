Unfortunately, it may suffer from negative transfer on heterogeneous composite tasks that have low similarity. Some studies try to learn an intertask alignment transformation based on the paired samples from the involved tasks, but risk a failed alignment with improper pairwise methods. To solve this issue, this study proposes an optimal correspondence assisted affine transformation (OCAT) algorithm. OCAT explicitly constructs a mathematical model for the intertask alignment problem and theoretically deduces its optimal solution in an iterative method. As a result, the sample correspondences that enable the learned transformation to achieve the maximum intertask similarity can be located. Besides, a novel approach to deriving the affine transformation formula is also developed for OCAT. The resulting affine alignment transformation will not impair the knowledge contained in the tasks during the alignment process. By integrating OCAT with the estimation of distribution algorithm, this study finally develops a manytasking optimization algorithm named MaT-EDA, where the solutions from other tasks are explicitly transferred as the samples for estimating the current distribution model. Extensive simulation studies have indicated that OCAT can significantly enhance the performance of EMTO, and MaT-EDA also achieves impressive many-tasking optimization performance.",

However, it has been pointed out that current MOEDAs have an intrinsic shortcoming in their modelbuilding algorithms that hamper their performance. In this work, we put forward the argument that error-based learning, the class of learning most commonly used in MOEDAs is responsible for current MOEDA underachievement.

A large number of studies have been conducted on EDA to propose numerous algorithms.

However, since the number of usable frequencies, which are necessary for the communication between mobile users and the base stations of cellular radio networks, is very limited, an efficient use of the frequency spectrum or channels is crucial to meet the increasing demands. Therefore while assigning the frequencies to different base stations, it is desirable to reuse the same frequency as much as possible. On the other hand, it is important to avoid possible interferences between different mobile users, at the same time, the number of frequencies assigned to each base station must be chosen large enough to satisfy the given demand in the corresponding cell. Regarding the above requirements, one can formulate the frequency assignment, problem as a discrete optimisation problem.",

Compared with classical methods, MOEAs are more suitable for solving MOPs for the following reasons: (i) multiple solutions can be found in a single run of a MOEA; (ii) a good spread of the nondominated solutions can be reached; and (iii) a MOEA is less susceptible to the shape or continuity of the Pareto-optimal front. Due to the conflicting relationships between objectives, it is unlikely to find such a solution that optimizes all objectives simultaneously. In practice, it is a hard task to find all nondominated solutions when, as is often the case, the number of Pareto-optimal solutions is huge or even infinite. Therefore, when applying an evolutionary algorithm to MOPs, two major issues should be addressed:",

Such problems generally have the following qualities: the search is for an optimal (or near optimal) pattern of values over a number (often many) of random variables; any candidate solution, which is an instantiation of each of those variables, has an associated score, which is its quality as a solution; a fitness function exists that takes a candidate solution and produces a score. The function (or algorithm) for calculating the score may be evaluated for any input vector, but may not be inverted to produce an input vector that would maximise the score. For this reason, the process of optimisation may be viewed as a directed search. Metaheuristics are methods for making use of the score returned by the fitness function to speed the search for good solutions when an exhaustive search would not be practical. Most metaheuristic algorithms maintain a memory of some kind that reflects the input patterns previously chosen and the scores they received.",

The dynamic performance was determined for the optimal HIDiC designs optimized previously using a constrained Boltzmann-based estimation of distribution algorithm. Eight close-boiling mixtures, covering a range of relative volatility ( $\\alpha$ ) from 1.12 to 2.4 , were used as case studies. The dynamic behavior was obtained under open and closed-loop process analysis. The results obtained showed that the HIDiC columns undergo worse dynamic performance than their equivalent traditional columns for all case studies. Furthermore, it was notorious that the difference in the dynamic behavior of both configurations kept a relatively uniform trend for most systems. However, a marked difference in the dynamic properties was determined for the mixture close to azeotropic behavior, which experienced a considerably larger control effort.\n\nThus, the novel findings disclosed in this paper show that, although the HIDiC sequences experienced worse dynamics than the conventional columns, the HIDiC configurations reached a stable dynamic behavior for all the range of $\\alpha$ of the mixtures under study. Nevertheless, high control difficulties were particularly determined for the HIDiC configuration used to separate the mixture with $\\alpha$ close to unity (mixture of xylenes), which in fact is the HIDiC sequence with the best energetic and economic benefits.\n\nHence, the energetic and economic potential of the HIDiC columns is not limited by the dynamic behavior for most case studies analyzed, at least in theoretical terms. However, such potential might be particularly reduced or unharnessed in the separation of the mixture with $\\alpha$ near the azeotropic behavior due to the dynamics of the HIDiC column for this separation.\n\nSo, the findings presented in this paper allow to infer that sequential or simultaneous dynamic studies must be achieved along with the optimization of the HIDiC columns to determine the integral performance (energetic, economic and dynamic) of these conf",

      "golden_chunk": "In this paper, a probabilistic model building GNP with multiple probability vectors (PMBGNP ${ }_{M}$ ) is proposed. In the proposed algorithm, multiple probability vectors are used in order to escape from premature convergence, and genetic operations like crossover and mutation are carried out to the probability vectors to maintain the diversities of the populations. The proposed algorithm is applied to the controller of autonomous robots and its performance is evaluated.\n\nA new directed graph based evolutionary algorithm named Genetic Network Programming (GNP) has been proposed recently [1][2][3]. Multiple nodes and their branches are used to construct the directed graph structures to represent the solutions of GNP. The node transitions of GNP can memorize the past judgment and processing information in the network flow implicitly and make quite compact structures.\n\nMany studies on evolutionary computation have been executed, such as Genetic Algorithm (GA) [4], Genetic Programming (GP) [5] and Evolutionary Programming (EP) [6]. Compared with these classical evolutionary algorithms, the directed graph structure based GNP has some properties to handle the problems in dynamic environments efficiently and effectively: (1) The directed graph structure of GNP are composed of a number of judgment and processing nodes, which can improve the expression ability of dynamic environments.",

      "golden_chunk": "This paper studies the probability distribution functions of the parameters to be learned and optimized in biped gait generation. By formulating the gait pattern generation into a multiobjective optimization problem with consideration of geometric and state constraints, dynamically stable and low energy cost biped gaits are generated and optimized by the proposed method, namely Spline-based Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA_S_Q). Instead of assuming variables as independent ones, the relationship between them is exploited by formulating the corresponding probability models with the Catmull-Rom cubic spline function. Such kind of function is proved to be a suboptimal and adaptive realization of the cubic spline function and is capable of providing highprecision description. Moreover, the probability models are updated autonomously by Q-learning method, which is model-free and adaptive. Thus, EDA_S_Q can deal with complex probability distribution functions without a prior knowledge about the distribution. The biped gait generated by EDA_S_Q has been verified using the simulation model of a humanoid soccer robot RoboErectus. It also shows that EDA_S_Q can generate the desired biped gaits autonomously in short learning epochs. An interpretation of the transition probability distribution achieved by EDA_S_Q provides us easy understanding for biped locomotion and better control in humanoid robots.",

Bayesian networks are used to model the probabilistic distribution and generate new individuals in the optimization process. Moreover, fitness value is assigned to each new individual using the extended Bayesian network as an approximate model to fitness function. Implementation issues such as individual control strategy, model management are addressed. Promising results are achieved in experiments on 5 UCI datasets. The results indicate that, as population-sizing requirements for building appropriate models of promising solutions lead to good fitness estimates, more compact feature subsets that give more accurate result can be found.",
