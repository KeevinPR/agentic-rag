As it was noted in Section 1, DSMGA utilizes a different clustering algorithm. An MDL-based metric was introduced to evaluate the quality of DSM clustering. Then, a GA was suggested, though not used in practice, to find optimal clustering using the MDL-based metric as fitness function. Instead, a simple hill climber was adopted to find appropriate clustering to save computational time.

As denoted in (14), the mean shift is operated on whole vectors for a superior solution, so it possesses rotation invariance. However, the mean shift for an inferior solution is operated for each dimension of the solution vector, thus leading to a difference between the two coordinate systems, as illustrated in Fig. 2. The distribution of an obtained shifted mean is closer to the dominant region in eigen coordinates than that in normal\n\ncoordinates, which can benefit the convergence of the algorithm. The efficiency of the eigen coordinate framework is discussed in the next section. The above improvements are based on the covariance matrix which may lead to a sharp decline in the population diversity at a later stage. A new search tool must be developed that is dependent on the covariance matrix to enrich the population diversity and reshape the ill-distribution of the solutions. In our RW-GEDA, we employ random walk strategies to enhance the exploration performance when the algorithm falls into stagnation. Random walk strategies are probabilistic models that involve strong simplifications of real animal movements [31], and have been widely used in many modern evolution algorithms, such as the grey wolf optimizer (GWO) [32], [33], cognitive behavior optimization algorithm (COA) [34], virus colony search (VCS) [35], and hummingbirds optimization algorithm (HOA) [36], to perform random exploration. Gaussian random walk and Lévy flight are the two main random walk strategies that have been shown to be surprisingly efficient for random searches in unknown circumstances and have been successfully adjusted to a wide range of empirical data. However, these two strategies have different characteristics. Gaussian random walk follows a Gaussian distribution, which is by far the most popular because many physical variables, including light intensity, errors or uncertainty in measurements, as well as many other processes, obey Gaussian distribution. It can make full use of the local solution space to generate promising candidates in the area of interest and is employed as an efficient way to improve the exploitation performance of the algorithm. In RW-GEDA, a disturbed Gaussian random walk strategy in the eigen coordinate framework is carried out guidance from the best solution. $$ \\begin{aligned} \\mathbf{x}{i}^{(E)}= & \\operatorname{Gaussian}\\left(\\mathbf{x}{\\text {Best }}^{(E)}, \\sigma\\right)+r{1} \\cdot \\mathbf{x}{\\text {Best }}^{(E)} \\\\ & -r{2} \\cdot \\mathbf{x}{i}^{(E)}, r{1}, r{2} \\sim U(0,1) \\\\ \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}= & \\left|\\mathbf{x}{\\text {Best }}^{(E)}-\\mathbf{x}{i}^{(E)}\\right| \\end{aligned} $$\n\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{x}_{\\text {Best }}$ indicates the best solution obtained thus far. Similar to (10), because the variance in the Gaussian distribution is related to the coordinate difference in each dimension, the distributions of sampling in different coordinate systems are quite different. As shown in Fig. 3, the distribution scope in eigen coordinates is more acceptable than that in normal coordinates. Unlike Gaussian random walk, Lévy walk is a random procedure and has a random step determined based on another important distribution that is the so-called Lévy distribution [37]. It is regarded as the most efficient method to explore the nondestructive space [38]. Moreover, Lévy walk is widely used as a predation behavior among the natural organisms, such as macaques, sharks and modern hunter gatherers. According to one study [39], Lévy walk is the optimal exploration behavior to search for randomly distributed objects. In this regard, it is advantageous to improve\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\n\nFIGURE 3. Different distribution obtained from Gaussian random walk in two coordinate systems. the ability of RW-GEDA to explore the search space. Lévy walk typically generates random steps from the individual location. However, in our RW-GEDA, Lévy walk is carried out with a center of the current optimal solution to perform a local exploration, which can help balance the exploration and development performance of the algorithm. According to the Mantegna strategy [40], the new candidate generated following the Lévy walk can be calculated using\n\n$$ \\mathbf{x}{i}^{(E)}=\\mathbf{x}{\\text {Best }}^{(E)}+\\alpha \\otimes \\operatorname{Levy}(s) \\otimes\\left(\\mathbf{x}{\\text {Best }}^{(E)}-\\mathbf{x}{i}^{(E)}\\right) $$\n\nWith regard to (18), $s=\\mu /|\\nu|^{1 / \\beta}$ denotes the step size, and $\\alpha$ is the scale factor and in the range of $[-1,1]$. The values of $\\beta$ have significance in determining the shape of the Lévy distribution [41], [42]. Longer jump steps are generated with a smaller $\\beta$ value; otherwise, a larger $\\beta$ value can generate smaller jump steps. In this study, we set $\\alpha=0.05$, and $\\beta=0.5$ to help generate longer jumps to avoid stagnation. $\\mu$ and $v$ are parameters that obey the following two different normal distributions, $N\\left(0, \\sigma_{\\mu}\\right)$ and $N\\left(0, \\sigma_{v}\\right)$ :\n\n$$ \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} \\sigma{\\mu}=\\left(\\frac{\\Gamma(1+\\beta) \\sin (\\pi \\beta)}{\\Gamma((1+\\beta) / 2) \\beta 2^{(\\beta-1) / 2}}\\right)^{1 / \\beta} \\\\ \\sigma{v}=1 \\end{array}\\right.",

However, they represent an opportunity for continuous problems where EDAs usually require sophisticated mechanisms to avoid getting trapped in local optima.

While MICPSO can explicitly incorporate constraints of the type present in vertex coloring by simply clamping certain values of the potential functions to zero, we expect that a traditional constraint solver would still outperform MICPSO on this problem. A second, related area of future work would be incorporating a structure learning step into MICPSO. While we already demonstrated that the algorithm can be effective for applications where the Markov network has a known structure, it will be important to test the algorithm's performance when the structure must be learned from data, as is the case in many applications of discrete optimization.",

Some constraints, such as those related to assembling multiple planet carriers, require the design variables (number of teeth) to be integers. The implementation should prioritize directly imposing integer constraints from the beginning, rather than seeking a continuous optimum first and then performing a neighbor search. This is because valuable integer solutions might be overlooked in the latter approach. Furthermore, the lower side constraints for the number of teeth ($N_j$) are defined by $N \\min_{j} \\leqslant N_{j}$ where $N \\min_{j}$ represents the minimum number of teeth allowed on sun or planet gears to avoid undercut. The value of $N \\min_{j}$ is typically 17, but can be lowered to 14 or even 12 if nonstandard gears are acceptable.

Likewise, the parameters ${ }^{\\circledR}$ had a search space in the interval $(-1,1]$. The decision to take only the first four polynomials to generate the fit curve was based on the fact that in previous papers the fit was made using a second degree curve so that when performing several experiments it was observed that a good fit was obtained through curves generated by a fourth order function, that is, using only the first four polynomials.",

It considers the relationship between assets and keeps discovering the interrelation among the assets during evolution. It can also utilize the distribution information from the historical solution set and learn from the proper investment. (3) We design a constructive approach to handle budget constraint, boundary constraint, grouping constraint, and cardinality constraint. This constructive approach guarantees to build feasible solutions, and thus it can improve efficiency as it avoids searching in infeasible areas. The proposed KC-EDA is more in line with the property of MVPO problem and the constructive approach is more efficient in searching for feasible portfolios.",

Consequently, the number of populations within the intelligent clusters increases, enhancing the algorithm's exploration capability. Conversely, for low dispersion evolution, the kernel density is increased, resulting in a probabilistic model with denser parent clusters and greater exploitation during the search process.

The most critical issue is the dimension of the objective space. It has been experimentally shown to have an exponential relation with the optimal size of the population (see [1] pp. 414-419). This fact implies that, with the increase of the number of objective functions an optimization algorithm needs an exponential amount of resources made available to it. In order to achieve a substantial improvement in the scalability of these algorithms it is therefore essential to arm them with a custom-made model building algorithm that pushes the population towards newly found zones in objective space.

Specifically, during the sampling phase, a check should be implemented to verify that any proposed solution satisfies this constraint before it is added to the population. If a solution violates the constraint, it should be either repaired (modified to satisfy the constraint) or discarded and a new solution sampled. Alternatively, the probability distribution can be modeled such that it inherently favors solutions that satisfy this constraint. This can be achieved by penalizing solutions that violate the constraint when updating the parameters of the probability distribution.

First, ADP's dynamic and Markov properties enables us to progressively explore solutions, markedly reducing computation time by eliminating the need to revisit previously executed jobs, a common occurrence in metaheuristic approaches. Second, ADP's policy approximation through Monte Carlo (MC) simulations is inherently parallelizable, leveraging the capabilities of multi-core CPU computers to our advantage. Third, the historical data derived from MC simulations can be efficiently integrated into powerful distribution-based metaheuristics such as EDA and ACO, allowing for the reuse of information.",

      "answer": "The Linear SVM (LSVM) aims to separate two classes using a hyperplane. The computation of this hyperplane involves maximizing a vector of Lagrange multipliers, denoted as alpha, in the equation W(alpha) = sum(alpha_i) - 1/2 * sum(alpha_i * alpha_j * y_i * y_j * K(x_i, x_j)), where the sums are from i=1 to l and j=1 to l. Here, 'l' represents the number of instances. The function K(x_i, x_j) is a kernel function. This maximization is subject to the constraints 0 <= alpha_i <= C and sum(alpha_i * y_i) = 0, where the sum is from i=1 to l. 'C' is a user-defined parameter that regulates the influence of outliers and noise. The values y_i and y_j represent the class labels (+1 or -1) of the instances x_i and x_j respectively. By maximizing W(alpha) under these constraints, the algorithm identifies the optimal hyperplane that satisfies the conditions of maximizing the distance from either class and ensuring that instances of the same class are largely on the same side of the hyperplane. This hyperplane is then used in the decision function pred(z) = sgn(w * z + b) to classify unseen instances 'z'.",

Since the GA's performance is considered a baseline, the MA implementation should prioritize reducing computational complexity in feature evaluation and selection, potentially through parallelization or approximation techniques.

Since 2003, our group led by Dr Friedrich Recknagel have initiated pioneering work on modelling algal blooms by using EAs [14]-[16]. Recently we developed a hybrid evolutionary algorithm (HEA) to build an algal abundance model with a single IF-THEN-ELSE rule structure [14]. The most advantage of such rule models lies in its high interpretability. Meanwhile from our research, we surprisingly found that when developing predictive rule model for algal abundance, in many runs, the modelling algorithm can find the threshold values for some key water quality parameters, like water temperature, pH value etc.",

The specific characteristics of the problem suggest that the most promising solutions are those in which tasks are performed by a quay crane that is near to their bay positions along the container vessel in order to reduce its moving distance.

The differences of between-subjects effects on Cmax and TEC are significant, so the optimization methods can also affect Cmax and TEC significantly. All in all, we find that different optimization goals and methods affect the Cmax and TEC significantly, so both environmental and production benefits can be enhanced simultaneously by optimizing the spindle speed and scheduling scheme, which is the first realization in this regard.",

Their performances on LSGO problems cannot be measured effectively [31]. Recently, this field has attracted increased research attention and the typical approaches include population reduction for differential evolution (DE) [5], Dynamic multi-swarm PSO [43], and estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) with mixed sampling operator [33].

This is because they do not point out one assumption that evaluation time of every candidate solution is indistinct. Here in this paper, a more challenging benchmark is utilized for testing, and a larger number of evaluations is required for computing QoSM of each solution. In Hybrid, every crossover operator requires two evaluations of two produced children in order to keep a child with a higher Tchebycheff score, while MNSGA2-EDA and NSGA-II both keep two children. For example, let us say that 500 children are kept for the next generation from the crossover, then Hybrid requires 1000 evaluations while MNSGA2-EDA and NSGA-II only require 500 evaluations.

Techniques like univariate or bivariate factorization, or more generally, multivariate Bayesian network learning, which imposes a factorization over problem variables, are able to estimate the joint probability distribution as the product of simpler factors. The use of probabilistic modeling in EDAs allows these algorithms to better exploit the information obtained up to the current stage of the search, in order to speed up convergence. Many of the probabilistic models employed in EDAs can also approximate the relationships or linkages between variables which is necessary for finding the optimal solutions to many problems.",

      "question": "Regarding the IRM-MEDA, RM-MEDA, NINA, and NSGA-II algorithms discussed, how do the coverage metrics, specifically the C-metric denoted as C(A,B), relate to the relative performance of these algorithms in terms of non-dominated solutions?",
      "topics": [
        "search"
      ],
      "answer": "The text indicates that IRM-MEDA exhibits superiority in terms of coverage, assessed by comparing box plots of \\$I_{C}(1, B)\\$ with \\$I_{C}(B, 1)\\$ for B in (2,3,4). For test system 2, the C-metric, C(1,2) and C(2,1), reveals that, on average, only 9.4% of non-dominated solutions of IRM-MEDA are covered by RM-MEDA and vice versa, demonstrating a low coverage between the two. Furthermore, NINA shows better results in terms of [FORMULA217] than NSGA-II, but the [FORMULA218] obtained by NINA is strongly worse than NSGA-II. Thus, a higher C-metric, C(A,B), implies that algorithm B covers more non-dominated solutions of algorithm A.",

      "chunk_content": "We estimate that IRM-MEDA has superiority over other three search algorithms in this problems as far as the coverage is concerned because the box plots of $I_{C}(1, B)$ are higher than the corresponding box plots of $I_{C}(B, 1)$, where $B \\in(2,3,4)$. Meanwhile, for the test system 2, it is clear from Table 4 that, in terms of $C$-metric, the coverage of non-dominated solutions of IRMMEDA are littleness, taking $C(1,2), C(2,1)$ as an example, on average, only $9.4 \\%$ non-dominated solutions of IRM-MEDA are covered by those of RM-MEDA and vice versa. What need especially alludes is, NINA shows better results in terms of [FORMULA217] than those of NSGA-II, however, the [FORMULA218] obtained by NINA is strongly worse than NSGA-II.",
