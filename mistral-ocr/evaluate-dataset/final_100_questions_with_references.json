In the design of a cellular communication network, the quality of service, the service coverage and the network cost are the three major concerns among many others that need to be optimized. These three factors are largely influenced by certain design parameter settings, such as the number of based stations (BSs), the locations of BSs, as well as the powers and antenna heights associated with each BS. In general, the more BSs are to be set up, the higher their powers and antenna heights are used, the larger the service area will be covered and the better the quality of service is, but the higher cost the network incurs."

In this article, we definitively introduce the Real-Valued GOMEA (RV-GOMEA), and introduce a new variant, constructed by combining GOMEA with what is arguably the best-known real-valued EA, the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategies (CMA-ES). Both variants of GOMEA are compared to L-BFGS and the Limited Memory CMA-ES (LM-CMAES). We show that both variants of RV-GOMEA achieve excellent performance and scalability in a GBO setting, which can be orders of magnitude better than that of EAs unable to efficiently exploit the GBO setting."

The Bhattacharyya coefficient of two property vectors is a measure of the similarity of the two distributions of population properties. The results for EDP and standard GP illustrate that search bias can be assessed by representing distributions using property vectors and measuring their similarity using the Bhattacharyya coefficient."

Thus, alternatives with other single probabilistic models or with multiple probabilistic models [32], [40] have been employed to solve continuous optimization problems. A few of these have been very effective in solving some multimodal problems. A few hybrid optimization algorithms have also been incorporated into EDAs [41]-[43]. However, the approaches have still not taken full advantage of the varying search area in each generation and historical population information.",

In this article, to enhance the exploration ability of model sampling, Cauchy distribution is applied to the EDA, providing a wider sampling space than the Gaussian model and avoiding the problem of sampled individuals falling into local optima.

Subsequently, EDAs [47] were extended to continuous optimization. Unlike other EAs, EDAs are a type of sampling algorithms based on probability distributions, and the individuals in the population are generated by sampling rather than crossover and mutation operations. The basic idea of an EDA is that a promising probabilistic model is constructed by extracting relevant distribution information from superior individuals in the population. The sampled individuals are then derived from the probabilistic models.",
        "Because the distinctive sampling mechanism of the EDA lacks the local search ability, in order to make full use of superior information between sampled individuals, a local improvement step based on the simplified gravitational search [48] and information learning is introduced. In this step, the current best individual $z_{c \\text { best }}$ is updated by simplified gravitational search, evolving with information from some superior individuals in the current population. Moreover, $z_{c \\text { best }}$ learns from the current best-sampled individual, as well as the evolved best individuals. This local improvement enhances the local search ability of the algorithm. It applies only to the recorded $z_{c \\text { best }}$ and so does not affect the current sampling."

Based on the model complexity, PMBGP can also be classified into three groups. Probabilistic incremental program evolution (PIPE) [32] is the first algorithm of PMBGP that extends the univari-\nate PBIL to GP for program evolution.

Additionally, measurements of Zn uptake rates and cellular quotas $(\\mathrm{Zn}: \\mathrm{P})$ are scarce (Sunda and Huntsman, 1992), posing a challenge to modelling studies in which simulated Zn uptake must represent a variety of oceanic phytoplankton species. Further difficulties arise from commonly made assumptions regarding the precision of observations and the accuracy of the model.",

Using synthetic observations that allow us full control over the target field, we aimed to investigate the algorithm's skill at retrieving parameter values and emergent model behaviour under real-world conditions resulting from data constraints, such as reduced data coverage and analytical errors, or from systematic bias between the model and target field related to either seasonality or large-scale physical circulation.",
        "Our ensemble of optimisations suggests that weighting is more important than the choice of squaring the residuals or not. Our optimisation results show that weighting squared residuals by the fractional volume of the grid cell (VolRMSE) results in large deviations from the reference uptake systematics whenever systematic differences in the underlying physical model are present (i. e. in synObs_seas and synObs_circ experiments), even with perfect data coverage; furthermore, weighting squared residuals by the inverse variance prevented CMA-ES from reaching its internal termination criterion.",

This is in agreement with previous studies that report a potentially large impact of the choice of the misfit function on the best estimate of biogeochemical fluxes and concentrations (e. g.

The factor of $r$ is a result of the increased waiting time to see a certain position out of $r$.

        "We now consider the final of the example functions central for this paper, more precisely the function JumpOfFSETSPIKE $_{m}$ having the fitness gap shifted to $[3 n / 4,3 n / 4+m]$ ones-bits and the global optimum in the middle of this gap at $3 n / 4+m / 2$ one-bits. First, we show negative results for the algorithms using majority-vote crossover, confirming our claim that these are too much tailored towards creating the all-ones string. Afterwards, we show that the cGA is very efficient on this function.",
        "To summarize, the cGA displays an interesting search trajectory on the JumpOfSEtSpike function that \"filters out\" deceptive information and thus is able to approach the all-ones string despite the reversed fitness gradient in the gap region. Such effects are also known for classical genetic algorithms and termed as implicit \"low-pass filter\" in [37]. However, it is worth pointing out that the results of Theorem 6 and Theorem 8 only show that the cGA is likely to sample from each Hamming level $m \\in[n / 2+\\epsilon n, n-\\epsilon n]$ at least once. If the set of global optima was only a small subset of a particular Hamming level, then the cGA could be likely to miss these optima as well as discussed in the following."

Such gaps can still be overcome efficiently in time $O(n \tilda{}log n)$ by majority-vote crossover and an estimation-of-distribution algorithm, even for gap sizes almost $\\sqrt{n}$. However, if the global optimum is located in the gap instead of the usual all-ones string, majority-vote crossover would nevertheless approach the all-ones string and be highly inefficient. In sharp contrast, an EDA can still find such a shifted optimum efficiently. Thanks to a general property called fair sampling, the EDA will with high probability sample from almost every fitness level of the function, including levels in the gap, and sample the global optimum even though the overall search trajectory points towards the all-ones string."

The ECSA uses a designed structure's edge cover queue for task scheduling. The ECSA mainly includes two programs: Init-S and Iteration-of-S. Init-S completes the heuristic generation of the initial edge cover queue and probability model matrix $S$. Iteration-of-S completes the iteration of $S$ and the edge cover queue.",

Unlike previous work using a vertex queue in the prioritizing phase and processor selection phase, the ECSA uses an edge cover queue for task scheduling. Furthermore, we propose a method using a simplified EDA and graph random walk algorithm to generate the edge cover queue. The tasks in an edge as a whole use the heuristic greedy cost function for processors' task assignments. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the ECSA can effectively improve the performance of task scheduling solutions and be closer to the optimal solution in fewer iterations and with low time complexity.",

The single individual updating strategy and the local EDA strategy not only greatly reduce the complexity of the EDA but also make the ECSA have fewer iterations.

        "Hopfield networks [18] are able to store patterns as point attractors in $n$ dimensional binary space and recall them in response to partial or degraded versions of stored patterns. For this reason, they are known as content addressable memories where each memory is a point attractor for nearby, similar patterns. Traditionally, known patterns are loaded directly into the network (see the learning rule 10 below), but in this paper we investigate the use of a Hopfield network to discover point attractors by sampling from a fitness function. A Hopfield network is a neural network consisting of $n$ simple connected processing units. The values the units take are represented by a vector, $\\mathbf{u}$ :",

        "In this section we describe a method for training a HEDA. The principles apply equally to HEDAs of higher order. During learning, candidate solutions are generated randomly one at a time. Each candidate solution is evaluated using the fitness function and the result is used as a learning rate in the Hebbian weight update rule (see update rule 15). Consequently, each pattern is learned with a different strength, which reflects its quality as a solution.",
        "One way in which researchers have addressed the question of linkage order is with the use of Walsh functions [6], [7]. These are described in detail in section 3 and summarised here. The Walsh functions form a basis for functions over $f:\\{0,1\\}^{n} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$. Any such function can be decomposed into a weighted sum of Walsh functions. The Walsh functions that contribute to the weighted sum are of differing orders, defined by the number of bits they contain that are set to 1.",
        "During the search process, new candidate solutions are generated by sampling the HEDA. The sampling process may be carried out in a number of ways. This paper is more concerned with network capacity than with the details of sampling methods, but some concepts are outlined here. Local optima can be sampled by picking a random pattern or a pattern from the current population if a population based search is being used and loading it into the network using equation 11."

Perfor-mance-guaranteed approximation algorithms of bounded complexity have been proposed to solve this problem [12], but the error bound guaranteed is not small enough for many applications.",

Its operational simplicity and applicability make it an advantageous method in relation to other widely applied evolutionary algorithms. The results of the experiments shown in this paper confirm that the EDA is a feasible alternative for the protein structure prediction problem. Particularly, we recommend the use of probabilistic models for the solution of coarse-grained protein folding problems, where Monte Carlo methods exhibit a poor performance.",

The univariate approximation is not able to capture the structural features of the problem represented in Table II. This experiment illustrates the convenience of using higher order interactions to capture relevant features of the problem structure. As it has been analyzed in previous sections, traditional crossover operators do not respect these interactions.",

Section V introduces the problem representation and discusses how the probability model can capture the regularities that may arise in the HP problem. In Section VI, the probabilistic models and the EDAs used for the protein structure problem are introduced. This section also presents the EDA model of protein folding. In Section VII, the experimental benchmark is introduced and numerical results of our experiments are presented. Finally, in Section VIII, the conclusions of our research are given, and further work is discussed."

We argue that EDAs are an efficient alternative for many instances of the protein structure prediction problem and are indeed appropriate for a theoretical analysis of search procedures in lattice models.

Considering that the problem is concerned with multi-dimensional discrete problems, an improved population-based incremental learning (PBIL) algorithm is applied, which the parameter for each component is independent with other components in PBIL. In order to improve the performance of PBIL, on the one hand, the integer encoding scheme is used and the method of probability calculation of PBIL is improved by using the task average processing time; on the other hand, an effective adaptive learning rate function that related to the number of iterations is constructed to trade off the exploration and exploitation of IEDA. In addition, both enhanced Max-Min and Min-Min algorithms are properly introduced to form two initial individuals. In the proposed IEDA, an improved genetic algorithm (IGA) is applied to generate partial initial population by evolving two initial individuals and the rest of initial individuals are generated at random. Finally, the sampling process is divided into two parts including sampling by probabilistic model and IGA respectively. The experiment results show that the proposed IEDA not only gets better solution, but also has faster convergence speed."

        "avoid premature convergence. For evolutionary algorithms models, there are two main ways to reduce the computational cost by integrating approximate models that exploit knowledge of past evaluation into the optimization: evolution control and surrogate approach [5]. As it is difficult to construct an approximate model that is globally correct due to the high dimensionality, ill distribution and limited number of training samples, it is found that the surrogate approach is likely to converge to a false optimum, which is an optimum of the approximate model, but not the one for the actual fitness function. Therefore, the evolution control approach is of more practical importance."

Bayesian networks are used to model the probabilistic distribution and generate new individuals in the optimization process. Moreover, fitness value is assigned to each new individual using the extended Bayesian network as an approximate model to fitness function. Implementation issues such as individual control strategy, model management are addressed. Promising results are achieved in experiments on 5 UCI datasets. The results indicate that, as population-sizing requirements for building appropriate models of promising solutions lead to good fitness estimates, more compact feature subsets that give more accurate result can be found."

In particular, the technique applies to any estimation of distribution algorithm where the sampling distribution can be computed from the current population. We demonstrate this new approach by analysing the expected runtime of the univariate marginal distribution algorithm (UMDA) on standard benchmark functions. In particular, for the LEADINGONES problem, we show a significantly improved upper bound on the runtime. Furthermore, we analyse the expected runtime on OneMax, a problem that has been remained open for a very long time.",
