Unlike traditional evolutionary algorithms that directly incorporate constraints into operators, EDAs often separate sequence searching and evaluation, allowing for a more general approach where constraints are considered during the evaluation phase. This separation enables EDAs to handle various ASS problem formulations by modifying the evaluation module without altering the core search mechanism. The paper uses a Mallows Model and Kendall-\u03c4 Distance under EDA for the permutation-based ASS formulation. This approach contrasts with methods like Receding Horizon Control (RHC) which require specifically designed operators to handle constraints.",
