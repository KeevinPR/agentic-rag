In Table 9, the results of scenario 2 also show that in most cases the fitness value of MrEDA is higher than that of rEDA, MARL and MAGA in the scenarios of increasing the number of abstract services. In particular, when fixing the number of abstract services, the fitness values of all approaches change very little with the increasing number of candidate services. While the fitness values have a significant increase in varying the number of abstract services when fixing the number of candidate services. The reason is that MrEDA exploits multiple RBMs with distinct explorations to refine the probabilistic model of solutions. The model provides useful information on how well the selected services contribute to the overall performance. In addition, the adaptive sampling improves the quality of the probabilistic model by adaptively adjusting the search of samples and improving the exploitability of samples. When generating solutions, the probabilistic",
