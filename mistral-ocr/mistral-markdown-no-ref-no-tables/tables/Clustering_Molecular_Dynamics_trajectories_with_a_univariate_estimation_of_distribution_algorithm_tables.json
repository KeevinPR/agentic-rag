To be precise, the partitions found by Clus-EDA and Clus-EDA ${ }_{w f}$ were further evaluated in exhaustive molecular docking experiments using all the 20,000 snapshots and one ligand at a time, and for each ligand it was computed the $F E B_{\\text {var }}$ for the corresponding partition. Recall that $F E B_{\\text {var }}$ is an average of the within-cluster FEB dispersion. The best execution of Clus-EDA provided a partition with 5060 clusters, whereas the best execution of Clus-EDA ${ }_{w f}$ generated a partition with 779 clusters. The best (lowest) results are highlighted in boldface. Note that ClusEDA outperformed $k$-means and UPGMA in 16 out of the 20 ligands that were used during the experiments. Clus-EDA ${ }_{w f}$, in turn, also outperformed $k$-means and UPGMA in 16 out of the 20 ligands, though generating a much smaller number of clusters (779), considering it penalizes for large values of $k$.",
