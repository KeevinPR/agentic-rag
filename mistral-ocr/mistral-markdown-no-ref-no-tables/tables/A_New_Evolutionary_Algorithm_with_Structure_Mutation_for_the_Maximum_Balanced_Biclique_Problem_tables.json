It can be seen that EA/SM produces significantly better results (lager $k$ ) than the Heuristic [9] on all benchmark graphs. In particular, EA/SM can achieve improvements of $5.12 \\%-21.48 \\%$ with very small standard deviations $(\\leq 1)$, and the improvements are more than $10 \\%$ in most cases (21/30). In addition, EA/SM can obtain a balanced biclique as large as the heuristic in very limited times of fitness evaluation; the value Ftime of EA/SM is $0.89 \\%-27.11 \\%$ of the $F_{\\max }$ and less than $10 \\%$ of the $F_{\\max }$ in most cases $(26 / 30)$. The invoking times of restart process are also very limited in EA/SM; the average period between restarts is $698.6-3072.2$ times of fitness evaluation. Given fixed $n$, as $p$ decreases, the problem becomes more difficult. The following results are observed: 1) the sizes $k$ obtained by both the heuristic algorithm [9] and EA/SM decrease sharply according with the boundary theory [4]; 2) the values of Ftime decrease, indicating EA/SM prone to converge more quickly; 3) the values of Rtime increase, indicating the restart process is invoked more frequently",
