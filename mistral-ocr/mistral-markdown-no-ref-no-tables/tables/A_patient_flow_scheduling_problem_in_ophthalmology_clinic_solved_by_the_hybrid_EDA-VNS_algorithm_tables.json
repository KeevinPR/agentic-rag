The combinations represent the number of patients, the number of doctors and the number of servers. Because the number of examination servers and the number of treatment servers are set to be the same, the number of servers can represent both the number of examination servers and the number of treatment servers. The average value of each generation in 20 experiments (Ave) and the minimum value of all experiments (Min) are also recorded in Table 12.
