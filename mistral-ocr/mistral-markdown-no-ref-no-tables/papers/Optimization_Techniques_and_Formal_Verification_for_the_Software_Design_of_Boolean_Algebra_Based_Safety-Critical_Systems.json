He has worked for more than 15 years in the development and certification of industrial safety-critical systems such as on-board SIL4 railway signalling systems (ERTMS/ETCS). His research interests include dependability, machine learning, and cybersecurity technologies.\n![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)\n\nJose Luis Flores received the M.Sc. degree in robotics and advanced control from the University of the Basque Country, San Sebastián, Spain, in 2003.\nHe is currently a Researcher with Ikerlan Technology Research Center, Mondragón, Spain, within the Cybersecurity in Embedded Systems team. His main interest is related to artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. As such, the main lines he works on in each organization are embedded system security with Ikerlan, and machine learning and optimization with the university.\n![img-6.jpeg](img-6.jpeg)\n\nChristian Blum received the Ph.D. degree in applied sciences from the Free University of Brussels, Brussels, Belgium, in 2004.\nHe is currently a Senior Research Scientist with the Artificial Intelligence Research Institute (IIIA-CSIC), Bellaterra, Spain. His research interests include solving difficult optimization problems using swarm intelligence techniques as well as combinations of metaheuristics with exact techniques.\n![img-7.jpeg](img-7.jpeg)\n\nJesús Cerquides received the Ph.D. degree in artificial intelligence from the UPC BarcelonaTech, Barcelona, Spain, in 2001.\nHe is currently a Senior Research Scientist with the Artificial Intelligence Research Institute (IIIA-CSIC), Bellaterra, Spain. His research interests include machine learning, probabilistic modeling, optimization, citizen science, and causality.\n![img-8.jpeg](img-8.jpeg)\n\nAlex Abuin is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in computer science, formal verification (model checking) with Ikerlan Technology Research Center (Dependable Embedded Systems), Mondragón, Spain and with the University of the Basque Country, San Sebastián, Spain.\nHe has done all his university studies with the Faculty of Computer Science, University of the Basque Country and has been a part of Ikerlan, Gipuzkoa, Spain, since 2014. There are two main research lines/topics in which he works: on the one hand, the realization of Certified Model Checking through Context-Based Temporal Tableaux Method and on the other hand, the application of formal methods in the industry.",
