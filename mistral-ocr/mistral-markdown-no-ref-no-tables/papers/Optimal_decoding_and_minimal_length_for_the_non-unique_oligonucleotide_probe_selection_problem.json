He joined the School of Computer Science at the University of Windsor in 2000 as an Assistant Professor, and have been appointed since 2004 as an Associate Professor. He was appointed as an Assistant Professor at the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at Lakehead University (Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada), 1998-2000, prior to joining the University of Windsor. During his short stay at Lakehead University, he co-founded Genesis Genomics Inc. in 1999; a biotechnology company specialized in the analysis of mitochondrial genome and the design of biomarkers for the early detection of cancer. His main research interests include but not limited to Computational Intelligence (CI) and Machine Learning (ML) methods. He has a special interest in the applications of CI/ML methods to Computational Biology and Bioinformatics problems, such as: microarray analysis, protein analysis, oligonucleotide selection, bio-image analysis, and gene regulatory network analysis. He also has interests in applying CI/ML to such areas as: multiple valued logic algebras and circuits, wireless mobile networks, scheduling, grid-computing, and uncertainty modeling.",
