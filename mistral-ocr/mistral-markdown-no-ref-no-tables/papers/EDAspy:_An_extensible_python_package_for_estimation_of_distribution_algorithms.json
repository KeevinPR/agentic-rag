He has been a Full Professor in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence with the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM), since 2007. Before moving to UPM, his academic career developed at the University of the Basque Country (UPV-EHU) through several faculty ranks: Assistant Professor, from 1985 to 1998, Associate Professor, from 1998 to 2004, and a Full Professor, from 2004 to 2007. He has published over 200\n\npapers in high-impact factor journals. He has supervised over 35 Ph.D. theses. His research interests include the areas of probabilistic graphical models, metaheuristics for optimization, data mining, classification models, and real applications, such as biomedicine, bioinformatics, neuroscience, industry 4.0, and sports. He is Fellow of the European Association for Artificial Intelligence, since 2012, and a Fellow of the Academia Europaea, since 2018. He has received the 2013 Spanish National Prize in computer science and the prize of the Spanish Association for Artificial Intelligence in 2018 and the 2020 Machine Learning Award from Amity University (India).\n![img-7.jpeg](img-7.jpeg)\n\nConcha Bielza received her M.S. degree in Mathematics from Universidad Complutense de Madrid, in 1989, and her Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM) in 1996 (extraordinary doctorate award). She is currently (since 2010) a Full Professor of Statistics and Operations Research with the Departamento de Inteligencia Artificial, UPM. Her research interests are primarily in the areas of probabilistic graphical models, decision analysis, metaheuristics for optimization, classification models, and real applications, such as biomedicine, bioinformatics, neuroscience and industry 4.0. She has published more than 150 papers in high impact factor journals and has supervised 22 Ph.D. theses. She was awarded the 2014 UPM Research Prize and the 2020 Machine Learning Award from Amity University (India).",
