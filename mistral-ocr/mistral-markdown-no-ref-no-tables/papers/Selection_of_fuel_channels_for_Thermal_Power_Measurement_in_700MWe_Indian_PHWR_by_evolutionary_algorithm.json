Gorakhpur University, India: joined Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited in 2003 as Scientific Officer. He is involved in reactor physics calculation like determining fresh core fuel loading pattern, criticality calculation of power reactors, fuel bunrup optimization and design of reactor regulation and protection systems for Indian PHWR. He has 4 publications in International Journals.\n\nDr. R.S. Modak joined Bhabha Atomic Research Center, India; in 1978 as Scientific Officer after completing a one year orientation course. He has obtained Ph.D. in Physics from University of Mumbai. His main fields of interest have been Nuclear Reactor Physics and Computational methods. He has contributed to the development of many efficient computational schemes and computer codes for the solution of static and time-dependent neutron diffusion and transport problems. Recently he has also been working on optimization problems in Nuclear Reactors. He has published about 20 papers in peer-reviewed International Journals.\n\nProf. S. Ganesan is the Head of Nuclear Data Section in the Reactor Physics Division in BARC. He was Associate Fellow of International Center for Theoretical Physics, Trieste, Italy (1988-1993). He was Head, Nuclear Data Section at IGCAR, Kalpakkam until 1990. He served as a Nuclear Physicist in the International Atomic Energy Agency during 1990-1994 when he led the efforts to create the successful Fusion Evaluated Nuclear data Library, FENDL, tailored to ITER applications. He has been involved in the successful creation and implementation of the WIM5D nuclear data library update project, international criticality safety benchmark evaluation project (ICSBEP) of the US-DOE/NEADB and EXFOR activities of International Nuclear Reaction Data Center (NRDC) network. He involved in the creation of Nuclear Data Physics Center of India (NDPCI). Currently, he is involved in critical assessment of benchmark validations of thorium fuel cycle and in neutron time of flight experiments and analysis including in BARC's participation in the CERN TOF collaboration.",
