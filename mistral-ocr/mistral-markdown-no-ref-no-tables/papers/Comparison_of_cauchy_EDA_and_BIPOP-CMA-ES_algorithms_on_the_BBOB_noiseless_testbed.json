Ratios $<10^{6}$ indicate an advantage of CauchyEDA, smaller values are always better. The line gets dashed when for any algorithm the ERT exceeds thrice the median of the trial-wise overall number of $f$-evaluations for the same algorithm on this function. Symbols indicate the best achieved $\\Delta f$-value of one algorithm (ERT gets undefined to the right). The dashed line continues as the fraction of successful trials of the other algorithm, where 0 means $0 \\%$ and the $y$-axis limits mean $100 \\%$, values below zero for CauchyEDA. The line ends when no algorithm reaches $\\Delta f$ anymore. The number of successful trials is given, only if it was in $\\{1 \\ldots 9\\}$ for CauchyEDA (1st number) and non-zero for BIPOP-CMA-ES (2nd number). Results are significant with $p=0.05$ for one star and $p=10^{-\\# *}$ otherwise, with Bonferroni correction within each figure.\n\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\n\nFigure 2: Expected running time (ERT in $\\log 10$ of number of function evaluations) of CauchyEDA versus BIPOP-CMA-ES for 46 target values $\\Delta f \\in\\left[10^{-8}, 10\\right]$ in each dimension for functions $f_{1}-f_{24}$. Markers on the upper or right egde indicate that the target value was never reached by CauchyEDA or BIPOP-CMA-ES respectively. Markers represent dimension: $2 \\imath+, 3 \\imath \\odot, 5 \\imath x, 10 \\imath \\circ, 20 \\imath \\odot, 40 \\imath \\odot$.\n\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\n\nFigure 3: Empirical cumulative distributions (ECDF) of run lengths and speed-up ratios in 5-D (left) and 20D (right). Left sub-columns: ECDF of the number of function evaluations divided by dimension $D$ (FEvals/D) to reach a target value $f_{\\text {opt }}+\\Delta f$ with $\\Delta f=10^{k}$, where $k \\in\\{1,-1,-4,-8\\}$ is given by the first value in the legend, for CauchyEDA (solid) and BIPOP-CMA-ES (dashed). Light beige lines show the ECDF of FEvals for target value $\\Delta f=10^{-9}$ of algorithms benchmarked during BBOB-2009. Right sub-columns: ECDF of FEval ratios of CauchyEDA divided by BIPOP-CMA-ES, all trial pairs for each function. Pairs where both trials failed are disregarded, pairs where one trial failed are visible in the limits being $>0$ or $<1$. The legends indicate the number of functions that were solved in at least one trial (CauchyEDA first).\n\n![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)\n\nTable 1: Expected running time (ERT in number of function evaluations) divided by the best ERT measured during BBOB-2009 (given in the respective first row) for different $\\Delta f$ values for functions $f_{1}-f_{24}$. The median number of conducted function evaluations is additionally given in italics, if $\\operatorname{ERT}\\left(10^{-7}\\right)=\\infty$. \\#succ is the number of trials that reached the final target $f_{\\text {opt }}+10^{-8}$. 0: BIP is BIPOP-CMA-ES and 1: Cau is CauchyEDA. Bold entries are statistically significantly better compared to the other algorithm, with $p=0.05$ or $p=10^{-6}$ where $k>1$ is the number following the $*$ symbol, with Bonferroni correction of 48.",
