Their capabilities, like representation, inference and learning, if used effectively, can greatly help to build intelligent systems that are able to act accordingly in different problem domains. Evolutionary algorithms is one such discipline that has employed probabilistic graphical models to improve the search for optimal solutions in complex problems. This paper shows how probabilistic graphical models have been used in evolutionary algorithms to improve their performance in solving complex problems. Specifically, we give a survey of probabilistic model building-based evolutionary algorithms, called estimation of distribution algorithms, and compare different methods for probabilistic modeling in these algorithms.

The main difference between other estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) and this new method-known as Evolutionary Bayesian Classifier-based Optimization Algorithms (EBCOAs)-is the way the fitness function is taken into account, as a new variable, to generate the probabilistic graphical model that will be applied for sampling the next population.We also present experimental results to compare performance of this new method with other methods of the evolutionary computation field like evolution strategies, and EDAs. Results obtained show that this new approach can at least obtain similar performance as these other paradigms.
Multimodality and the Linkage-Learning Difficulty of Additive ly Separable Functions;Full Text @ UPM;https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000364333000047;Martins, J and Delbem, ACB;Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) have emerged from the synergy between machine-learning techniques and Genetic Algorithms (GAs). EDAs rely on probabilistic modeling for obtaining information about the underlying structure of optimization problems and implementing effective reproduction operators. The effectiveness of EDAs depends on the capacity of the model-building to extract reliable information about the problem. In this study we analyze additively separable functions and argue that the degree of multimodality of such functions defines their linkage-learning difficulty. Besides, by using entropy-based concepts and Jensen's inequality, we show how allelic pairwise independence may appear as a consequence of an increasing multimodality. The results characterize the linkage-learning difficulty of well-known functions, like the deceptive trap, bipolar and concatenated parity.
Truncation selection and Gaussian EDA:: Bounds for sustainable progress in high-dimensional spaces;Full Text @ UPM;https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000254509400058;Posík, P;In real-valued estimation-of-distribution algorithms, the Gaussian distribution is often used along with maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of its parameters. Such a process is highly prone to premature convergence. The simplest method for preventing premature convergence of Gaussian distribution is enlarging the maximum likelihood estimate of a by a constant factor k each generation. Such a factor should be large enough to prevent convergence on slopes of the fitness function, but should not be too large to allow the algorithm converge in the neighborhood of the optimum. Previous work showed that for truncation selection such admissible k exists in ID case. In this article it is shown experimentaly, that for the Gaussian EDA with truncation selection in high-dimensional spaces no admissible k exists!.
