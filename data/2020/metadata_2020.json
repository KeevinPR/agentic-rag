        "description": "Estimation-of-distribution algorithms (EDAs) are randomized search heuristics that create a probabilistic model of the solution space, which is updated iteratively, based on the quality of the solutions sampled according to the model. As previous works show, this iteration-based perspective can lead to erratic updates of the model, in particular, to bit-frequencies approaching a random boundary value. In order to overcome this problem, we propose a new EDA based on the classic compact genetic algorithm (cGA) that takes into account a longer history of samples and updates its model only with respect to information which it classifies as statistically significant. We prove that this significance-based cGA (sig-cGA) optimizes the commonly regarded benchmark functions OneMax (OM), LeadingOnes, and BinVal all in quasilinear time, a result shown for no other EDA or evolutionary algorithm so far. For the recently proposed stable compact genetic algorithm\u2014an EDA that tries to prevent erratic model updates by imposing a bias to the uniformly distributed model\u2014we prove that it optimizes OM only in a time exponential in its hypothetical population size. Similarly, we show that the convex search algorithm cannot optimize OM in polynomial time.",

        "description": "This paper proposes a novel control framework and the corresponding strategy for power sources management in connected plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (cPHEVs). A mobile edge computation (MEC) based control framework is developed first, evolving the conventional on-board vehicle control unit (VCU) into the hierarchically asynchronous controller that is partly located in cloud. Elaborately contrastive analysis on the performance of processing capacity, communication frequency and communication delay manifests dramatic potential of the proposed framework in sustaining development of the cooperative control strategy for cPHEVs. On the basis of MEC based control framework, a specific cooperative strategy is constructed. The novel strategy accomplishes energy flow management between different power sources with incorporation of the active energy consumption plan and adaptive energy consumption management. The method to generate the reference battery state-of-charge (SOC) trajectories in energy consumption plan stage is emphatically investigated, fast outputting reference trajectories that are tightly close to results by global optimization methods. The estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) is employed to output reference control policies under the specific terminal conditions assigned via the machine learning based method. Finally, simulation results highlight that the novel strategy attains superior performance in real-time application that is close to the offline global optimization solutions.",

        "description": "Dynamic Multiobjective Problems cover a set of real-world problems that have many conflicting objectives. These problems are challenging and well known by the dynamic nature of their objective functions, constraint functions, and problem parameters which often change over time. In fact, dealing with these problems has not been investigated in detail using the Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs). Thus, we propose in this paper an EDA-based on Vine Copulas algorithm to deal with Dynamic Multiobjective Problems (DMOPs). Vines Copulas are graphical models that represent multivariate dependence using bivariate copulas. The proposed Copula-based Estimation of Distribution Algorithm, labeled Dynamic Vine-Copula Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (DynVC-EDA), is used to implement two search strategies. The first strategy is an algorithm that uses the model as a memory to save the status of the best solutions obtained during the current generation. The second strategy is a prediction-based algorithm that uses the history of the best solutions to predict a new population when a change occurs. The proposed algorithms are tested using a set of benchmarks provided with CEC2015 and the Gee-Tan-Abbass. Statistical findings show that the DynVC-EDA is competitive to the state-of-the-art methods in dealing with dynamic multiobjective optimization.",

The evenly distributed qualitative and diverse solutions on the Pareto front are required for a decision-maker for selecting a final optimal solution. Such a Pareto front can be achieved by obtaining the balance between convergence and diversity of multi-objective optimisation algorithm. Therefore, the proposed method combined dominance and decomposition techniques, modelled meter placement as a constrained combinatorial multi-objective optimisation. The meter placement is designed as a trade-off between three objectives that are minimising the cost of the meters, average relative percentage error (ARPE) of voltage magnitude and ARPE of voltage angle. As the meter placement problem is a combinatorial optimisation, the binomial distribution-based Monte Carlo method is utilised to initialise the population, which aims to improve the diversity, as a consequence it improves the convergence, which is a by-product of this method. The results of the proposed method are compared with multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II and with multi-objective hybrid particle swarm optimisation-krill herd algorithm, multi-objective hybrid estimation of distribution algorithm-interior point method and demonstrated on PG&amp;E 69-bus distribution system and Practical Indian 85-bus distribution system.",

This is the first direct lower bound on the run time of UMDA. It is stronger than the bounds that follow from general black-box complexity theory and is matched by the run time of many evolutionary algorithms. The results are obtained through advanced analyses of the stochastic change of the frequencies of bit values maintained by the algorithm, including carefully designed potential functions.

Robotic assembly lines are widely-used in automotive and electronic manufacturing. It is necessary to consider the energy saving and economic criteria simultaneously when robots are utilized to operate assembly tasks replacing human labor. This paper addresses an energy-efficient robotic assembly line balancing (EERALB) problem with the criteria to minimize both the cycle time and total energy consumption. We present a multi-objective mathematical model and propose a bound-guided hybrid estimation of distribution algorithm to solve the problem. When designing the optimization algorithm, we adopt estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) to tackle the task assignment, and design a non-dominated robot allocation (NGRA) heuristic which is embedded into the EDA to allocate suitable robot to each workstation. Moreover, we propose a bound-guided sampling (BGS) method, which is able to reduce the search space of EDA and focus the search on the promising area. The computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is analyzed and the effectiveness of the proposed NGRA and BGS is tested.

To solve such optimization problems, interactive evolutionary algorithms, which can make use of human preferences, are highly desirable. However, due to the lack of effective encoding methods, interactive evolutionary algorithms have been limited to numerically encoded optimization problems. In practice, however, linguistic terms (words) are the most natural expression of human preferences, and they are also commonly used to describe items in personalized search or E-commerce; therefore, language models better suit encoding, and the optimization of personalized search is converted into a dynamic document matching problem. To optimize word-described personalized search, we propose a novel interactive estimation of distribution algorithm. This algorithm combines a language model-based encoding approach, a Dirichlet-Multinomial compound distribution-based preference expression, and a Bayesian inference mechanism. The proposed algorithm is applied to two personalized search cases to demonstrate the capability of the algorithm in ensuring a more efficient and accurate search with less user fatigue.

The challenge of this problem lies in its complex quantifying evaluations and dynamic user preferences. A user-involved interactive evolutionary algorithm is a good choice if it has reliable preference surrogate and powerful evolutionary strategies. A Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) assisted Interactive Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (IEDA) is presented to enhance the IEDA in solving the personalized search. Specifically, a dual-RBM module is developed to simultaneously provide a preference surrogate and a probability model for conducting the individual selection and generation of the IEDA. Firstly, the positive and negative preferences of the currently involved user in IEDA are distinguished and combined to achieve a dual-RBM, and then the weighted energy functions of the RBM model together with social group information from users with similar preferences are designed as the preference surrogate. The probability of the trained positive RBM on the visible units is fetched as the reproduction model of EDA since it reflects the attribute distributions of more preferred items. Some benchmarks from the Movielens and Amazon datasets are applied to experimentally demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the interactive evolutionary computations served personalized search.

        "description": "The offshore wind turbines are dynamically sensitive, whose fundamental frequency can be very close to the forcing frequencies activated by the environmental and turbine loads. Minor changes of support conditions may lead to the shift of natural frequencies, and this could be disastrous if resonance happens. To monitor the support conditions and thus to enhance the safety of offshore wind turbines, a model updating method is developed in this study. A hybrid sensing system was fabricated and set up in the laboratory to investigate the long-term dynamic behaviour of the offshore wind turbine system with monopile foundation in sandy deposits. A finite element model was constructed to simulate structural behaviours of the offshore wind turbine system. Distributed nonlinear springs and a roller boundary condition are used to model the soil-structure interaction properties. The finite element model and the test results were used to analyse the variation of the support condition of the monopile, through an finite element model updating process using estimation of distribution algorithms. The results show that the fundamental frequency of the test model increases after a period under cyclic loading, which is attributed to the compaction of the surrounding sand instead of local damage of the structure. The hybrid sensing system is reliable to detect both the acceleration and strain responses of the offshore wind turbine model and can be potentially applied to the remote monitoring of real offshore wind turbines. The estimation of distribution algorithm-based model updating technique is demonstrated to be successful for the support condition monitoring of the offshore wind turbine system, which is potentially useful for other model updating and condition monitoring applications.",

        "description": "For complex system design [e.g., satellite layout optimization design (SLOD)] in practical engineering, when launching a new optimization instance with another parameter configuration from the intuition of designers, it is always executed from scratch which wastes much time to repeat the similar search process. Inspired by transfer learning which can reuse past experiences to solve relevant tasks, many researchers pay more attention to explore how to learn from past optimization instances to accelerate the target one. In real-world applications, there have been numerous similar source instances stored in the database. The primary question is how to measure the transferability from numerous sources to avoid the notorious negative transferring. To obtain the relatedness between source and target instance, we develop an optimization instance representation method named centroid distribution, which is by the aid of the probabilistic model learned by elite candidate solutions in estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) during the evolutionary process. Wasserstein distance is employed to evaluate the similarity between the centroid distributions of different optimization instances, based on which, we present a novel framework called multisource selective transfer optimization with three strategies to select sources reasonably. To choose the suitable strategy, four selection suggestions are summarized according to the similarity between the source and target centroid distribution. The framework is beneficial to choose the most suitable sources, which could improve the search efficiency in solving multiobjective optimization problems. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and selection suggestions, we conduct two experiments: 1) comprehensive empirical studies on complex multiobjective optimization problem benchmarks and 2) a real-world SLOD problem. Suggestions for strategy selection coincide with the experiment results, based on which, we propose a mixed strategy to deal with the negative transfer in the experiments successfully. The results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves competitive performance on most of the benchmark problems in convergence speed and hypervolume values and performs best on the real-world applications among all the comparison algorithms.",

        "description": "The aim of AI planning is to solve the problems with no exact solution available. These problems usually have a big search space, and planning may not find plans with the least actions and in the shortest time. Recent researches show that using suitable heuristics can help to find desired plans. In planning problems specified formally through graph transformation system (GTS), there are dependencies between applied rules (actions) in the search space. This fact motivates us to solve the planning problem for a small goal (instead of the main goal), extract dependencies from the searched space, and use these dependencies to solve the planning problem for the main goal. In GTS based systems, the nodes of a state (really is a graph) can be grouped due to their type. To create a small (refined) goal, we use a refinement technique to remove the predefined percent of nodes from each group of the main goal. Bayesian Optimization Algorithm (BOA) is then used to solve the planning problem for the refined goal. BOA is an Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) in which Bayesian networks are used to evolve the solution populations. Actually, a Bayesian network is learned from the current population, and then this network is employed to generate the next population. Since the last Bayesian network learned in BOA has the knowledge about dependencies between applied rules, this network can be used to solve the planning problem for the main goal. Experimental results on four well-known planning domains confirm that the proposed approach finds plans with the least actions and in the lower time compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.",

However, the previous newsvendor models assume that the selling price of a product is a predefined constant and only regard the order quantity as a decision variable, which may result in an unreasonable investment decision. In this article, a new newsvendor model is first proposed, which involves of both order quantity and selling price as decision variables. In this way, the newsvendor problem is reformulated as a mixed-variable nonlinear programming problem, rather than an integer linear programming problem as in previous investigations. In order to solve the mixed-variable newsvendor problem, a histogram model-based estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) called EDA(mvn) is developed, in which an adaptive-width histogram model is used to deal with the continuous variables and a learning-based histogram model is applied to deal with the discrete variables. The performance of EDA(mvn) was assessed on a test suite with eight representative instances generated by the orthogonal experiment design method and a real-world instance generated from real market data of Alibaba.

        "description": "The uncertain capacitated arc routing problem is of great significance for its wide applications in the real world. In the uncertain capacitated arc routing problem, variables such as task demands and travel costs are realised in real time. This may cause the predefined solution to become ineffective and/or infeasible. There are two main challenges in solving this problem. One is to obtain a high-quality and robust baseline task sequence, and the other is to design an effective recourse policy to adjust the baseline task sequence when it becomes infeasible and/or ineffective during the execution. Existing studies typically only tackle one challenge (the other being addressed using a naive strategy). No existing work optimises the baseline task sequence and recourse policy simultaneously. To fill this gap, we propose a novel proactive-reactive approach, which represents a solution as a baseline task sequence and a recourse policy. The two components are optimised under a cooperative coevolution framework, in which the baseline task sequence is evolved by an estimation of distribution algorithm, and the recourse policy is evolved by genetic programming. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm, called Solution-Policy Coevolver, significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms to the uncertain capacitated arc routing problem for the ugdb and uval benchmark instances. Through further analysis, we discovered that route failure is not always detrimental. Instead, in certain cases (e.g., when the vehicle is on the way back to the depot) allowing route failure can lead to better solutions.",

However, one important limitation of this algorithm is its memory consumption, which is in the order of 120 GB. Here, we follow up on this research by applying to the same problem a GPU-enabled \"compact\" Genetic Algorithm, i.e., an Estimation of Distribution Algorithm that instead of using an actual population of candidate solutions only requires and adapts a probabilistic model of their distribution in the search space. We also introduce a smart initialization technique and custom operators to guide the search towards feasible solutions.

        "description": "Due to the advantages of high prediction accuracy, least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) has been widely utilized for soft sensor developments in industrial processes. The hyper-parameters of LSSVM are often determined by minimizing the predicted error of validation set based on the intelligent optimization algorithm, which may lead to excessive optimization and model overfitting when validation set are selected improperly. Meanwhile, online parameters optimization is difficult to implement, which results in poor effect of local modeling. This paper proposes UMDA-LOS-LSSVM that is a LSSVM with parameters optimization in local objective set (LOS-LSSVM) by univariate marginal distribution algorithm (UMDA) based on the idea of local modeling. First, the local objective set is extracted in the candidate set based on the testing samples. Then, UMDA is utilized for minimize the predicted error of the objective set and provides the optimized parameters. Finally, training and testing of LSSVM are carried out based on the optimal parameters. In addition, this paper provides the distributed parallel form of the proposed method, which can be used for big data modeling and soft sensor development. The proposed method is applied in a CO2 absorbing column unit to estimate the residual CO2 content, which is implemented through an industrial big data distributed analytics platform. The results show a significant improvement of proposed method based soft sensor, compared to traditional methods.",

To enhance exploitation, a specific local search is designed to improve performance of non-dominated solutions. Moreover, destruction and reconstruction methods in the IG-mode search are employed for further exploiting better solutions. To balance exploration and exploitation capabilities, a cooperation scheme for mode switching is designed based on the information entropy and the diversity of elite solutions.

        "description": "Most existing methods of multiobjective estimation of distributed algorithms apply the estimation of distribution of the Pareto-solution on the decision space during the search and little work has proposed on making a regression-model for representing the final solution set. Some inverse-model-based approaches were reported, such as inversed-model of multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (IM-MOEA), where an inverse functional mapping from Pareto-Front to Pareto-solution is constructed on nondominated solutions based on Gaussian process and random grouping technique. But some of the effective inverse models, during this process, may be removed. This paper proposes an inversed-model based on random forest framework. The main idea is to apply the process of random forest variable importance that determines some of the best assignment of decision variables (x(n)) to objective functions (f(m)) for constructing Gaussian process in inversed-models that map all nondominated solutions from the objective space to the decision space. In this work, three approaches have been used: classical permutation, Naive testing approach, and novel permutation variable importance. The proposed algorithm has been tested on the benchmark test suite for evolutionary algorithms [modified Deb K, Thiele L, Laumanns M, Zitzler E (DTLZ) and Walking Fish Group (WFG)] and indicates that the proposed method is a competitive and promising approach.",

        "description": "Flowshop scheduling is a well-known NP-hard problem. Sustainable scheduling problem has recently attracted the attention of researchers due to the importance of energy and environmental issues. Moreover, considering uncertainty in the real-world manufacturing environment makes the problem more realistic. Insufficient researches on energy issue under uncertainty were encouraging to conduct this study. In this paper, a mathematical formulation and a scenario-based estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) are proposed to address the flowshop scheduling problem to optimize makespan and energy consumption under uncertainty. To the best of knowledge, scenario-based EDA has not been used to solve this problem. In this study, it is assumed that the processing times are stochastic and follow the normal distribution with known average and variance. In this problem, the machines have different processing speeds and reducing machine speeds increase makespan and decrease energy consumption and conversely. So, machine speeds affect the objective values which are conflicting. The proposed formulation assigns speeds to machines as well as decides about job sequencing. Different scenarios are used to consider stochastic processing times; so, the E-model approach is used for evaluation of objective functions. At the end, the computational experiment is presented and its results show promising performance of EDA in comparison to another algorithm. The proposed algorithm as practical method gives through insight about the problem and because of the suitable number of solutions in the Pareto set, the decision maker has more choice compared to the competing algorithm.

The second subpopulation consists of some individuals generated by a novel sampling strategy to improve population convergence as well as distribution. The third subpopulation comprises some individuals generated using a shrinking strategy based on the probability distribution of variables.

These algorithms have different pros and cons, and no algorithm is the best for all datasets. Hence, a challenging problem consists of choosing the best classification algorithm with its best hyper-parameter settings for a given input dataset. In the last few years, Automated Machine Learning (Auto-ML) has emerged as a promising approach for tackling this problem, by doing a heuristic search in a large space of candidate classification algorithms and their hyper-parameter settings. In this work we propose an improved version of our previous Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) - more precisely, an Estimation of Distribution Algorithm - for the Auto-ML task of automatically selecting the best classifier ensemble and its best hyper-parameter settings for an input dataset. The new version of this EA was compared against its previous version, as well as against a random forest algorithm (a strong ensemble algorithm) and a version of the well-known Auto-ML method Auto-WEKA adapted to search in the same space of classifier ensembles as the proposed EA. In general, in experiments with 21 datasets, the new EA version obtained the best results among all methods in terms of four popular predictive accuracy measures: error rate, precision, recall and F-measure.

        "description": "Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) are metaheuristics where learning a model and sampling new solutions replaces the variation operators recombination and mutation used in standard Genetic Algorithms. The choice of these models as well as the corresponding training processes are subject to the bias/variance tradeoff, also known as under- and overfitting: simple models cannot capture complex interactions between problem variables, whereas complex models are susceptible to modeling random noise. This paper suggests using Denoising Autoencoders (DAEs) as generative models within EDAs (DAE-EDA). The resulting DAE-EDA is able to model complex probability distributions. Furthermore, overfitting is less harmful, since DAEs overfit by learning the identity function. This overfitting behavior introduces unbiased random noise into the samples, which is no major problem for the EDA but just leads to higher population diversity. As a result, DAE-EDA runs for more generations before convergence and searches promising parts of the solution space more thoroughly. We study the performance of DAE-EDA on several combinatorial single-objective optimization problems. In comparison to the Bayesian Optimization Algorithm, DAE-EDA requires a similar number of evaluations of the objective function but is much faster and can be parallelized efficiently, making it the preferred choice especially for large and difficult optimization problems.",

Since no new data can be used to improve the surrogate models, offline data-driven optimization remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a Gaussian process assisted offline estimation of multivariate Gaussian distribution algorithm to address the offline data-driven optimization problem. Instead of using surrogate models to predict the fitness values of individuals, we utilize a surrogate model to predict the rankings of individuals based on the frequently used lower confidence bound. In this way, the robustness of the proposed algorithm could be enhanced. Experiments are conducted on five commonly used benchmark problems.

Limited manufacturing resources and buffers may lead to blockage and deadlock phenomenon. In order to establish production scheduling with minimum makespan, the timed Petri net (PN) model of a production process is established. Based on this PN model, a novel Hybrid Estimation-of-Distribution Algorithm (HEDA) is proposed for solving the considered scheduling problem. A candidate solution for the problem is coded as an individual that consists of a route sequence for processing jobs and a permutation with repetition of jobs. A deadlock prevention policy is used to check the feasibility of individuals, such that it can be decoded into a feasible sequence of transitions, i.e., a feasible schedule. By using an effective voting procedure of elite individuals, two probability models in HEDA corresponding to different subsections of individuals are constructed. Based on the probability models, offspring individuals are then produced. As an improvement strategy, simulated-annealing-based local search is designed and incorporated into HEDA to enhance the entire algorithm's search ability. The proposed hybrid HEDA is tested on FJS examples. The results show its feasibility and effectiveness.",

However, the commonly used Gaussian EDA (GEDA) usually suffers from premature convergence, which severely limits its search efficiency. This paper first systematically analyzes the reasons for the deficiency of traditional GEDA, then tries to enhance its performance by exploiting the evolution direction, and finally develops a new GEDA variant named EDA(2). Instead of only utilizing some good solutions produced in the current generation to estimate the Gaussian model, EDA(2) preserves a certain number of high-quality solutions generated in the previous generations into an archive and employs these historical solutions to assist estimating the covariance matrix of Gaussian model. By this means, the evolution direction information hidden in the archive is naturally integrated into the estimated model, which in turn can guide EDA(2) toward more promising solution regions. Moreover, the new estimation method significantly reduces the population size of EDA(2) since it needs fewer individuals in the current population for model estimation. As a result, a fast convergence can be achieved. To verify the efficiency of EDA(2), we tested it on a variety of benchmark functions and compared it with several state-of-the-art EAs.

        "description": "Gene expression programming (GEP), which is a variant of genetic programming (GP) with a fixed-length linear model, has been applied in many domains. Typically, GEP uses genetic operators to generate offspring. In recent years, the estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) has also been proven to be efficient for offspring generation. Genetic operators such as crossover and mutation generate offspring from an implicit model by using the individual information. By contrast, EDA operators generate offspring from an explicit model by using the population distribution information. Since both the individual and population distribution information are useful in offspring generation, it is natural to hybrid EDA and genetic operators to improve the search efficiency. To this end, we propose a hybrid offspring generation strategy for GEP by using a univariate categorical distribution based EDA operator and its original genetic operators. To evaluate the performance of the new hybrid algorithm, we apply the algorithm to ten regression tasks using various parameters and strategies. The experimental results demonstrate that the new algorithm is a promising approach for solving regression problems efficiently. The GEP with hybrid operators outperforms the original GEP that uses genetic operators on eight out of ten benchmark datasets.",

Moreover, the network pricing mechanism and game theory are introduced and a dynamic bandwidth resource allocation model of the overall control system for optimal performance is obtained. Thus, the problem of the network resource allocation of the SD-NCCS has been converted to be the problem of solving the Nash equilibrium point under the non-cooperative game model.

In this paper, we propose a novel modified EDA with a multi-leader search (MLS) mechanism, namely, the MLS-EDA. To strengthen the exploration performance, an enhanced distribution model that considers the information of population and distribution is utilized to generate new candidates. Moreover, when the algorithm stagnates, the MLS mechanism will be activated to perform a local search and shrink the search scope. The performance of the MLS-EDA in addressing complex optimization problems is verified using the CEC 2014 and CEC 2017 testbeds with 30D, 50D and 100D tests.

The exploration of design space for finding the best power-throughput trade-off is a combinatorial optimization problem with a large number of combinations, and. in general, its solution is prohibitively difficult to be explored exhaustively. However, fortunately, evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have the potential to efficiently solve this problem with reasonable computational complexity. In this paper, we consider a multiobjective design space exploration (DSE) problem with two conflicting objectives. The first objective corresponds to power consumption minimization while the second objective relates to throughput maximization. We approach this problem by employing the estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA), which belongs to the family of EAs. The proposed EDA-based DSE (EDA-DSE) scheme efficiently selects the design parameters (i.e. cache size, number of cores, and operating frequency) with an efficient power-throughput ratio. The proposed scheme is verified using cycle-accurate simulations over a set of benchmarks and the simulation results show a significant reduction in energy-delay product for all benchmark applications when compared to the default baseline configuration and genetic algorithm.",

        "description": "Considering the important issue of computer infections by worms spread via networks, the theme of source identification has been a prominent research field that aims at investigating infection propagation including acquiring knowledge about the infection and the node removal times when a worm infection happens. This information helps in identifying the patient zero in the worm attack and may be used by computer forensic investigators and network administrators to spot the culprits and to identify related network vulnerabilities. In this paper, we tackle this problem by developing new probabilistic models based on Bayesian networks. We learn a probability distribution to calculate, at every time step, the probability that each node is infected by a scanning worm, using historical data and features extracted from the network and application layers. With the mentioned probability distribution, the node infection status can be inferred using feature values at each time step. We propose a four-step method to investigate the time of infection and removal of each node probabilistically. First, features are extracted and derived from network traffic data. There are no suitable training and test datasets publicly available for our tests; therefore, we developed the training and test datasets using simulations of the Code Red II worm. Second, a prior model is built using training data. Third, the probabilistic model is built by the estimation of distribution algorithm. Fourth, the infection probability of nodes is inferred given the probability distribution and feature values at each time step. It has already been shown that the number of infectious nodes can be probabilistically approximated backward in time through the stochastic Back-to-Origin Markov model. We combine our first model with the prior stochastic Back-to-Origin Markov model to develop our second model. To evaluate our first and second models, we conducted experiments that show that these models can pinpoint the source node and the infection time of nodes with acceptable accuracy. It should be noted that our method could be employed with other propagating worm types including ransomware worms.",

In this paper, the estimation of distribution algorithms are used to solve nonlinear continuous optimization problems that contain noise. One common approach to dealing with these problems is to combine sampling methods with optimal search methods. Sampling techniques have a serious problem when the sample size is small, so estimating the objective function values with noise is not accurate in this case. In this research, a new sampling technique is proposed based on fuzzy logic to deal with small sample sizes. Then, simulation-based optimization methods are designed by combining the estimation of distribution algorithms with the proposed sampling technique and other sampling techniques to solve the stochastic programming problems. Moreover, additive versions of the proposed methods are developed to optimize functions without noise in order to evaluate different efficiency levels of the proposed methods. In order to test the performance of the proposed methods, different numerical experiments were carried out using several benchmark test functions. Finally, three real-world applications are considered to assess the performance of the proposed methods.",

Classical population-based evolutionary algorithms (EAs) typically converge only to a single solution. While this can be counteracted by applying niching strategies, the number of optima is nonetheless trivially bounded by the population size.|Estimation-of-distribution algorithms (EDAs) are an alternative, maintaining a probabilistic model of the solution space instead of an explicit population. Such a model is able to implicitly represent a solution set that is far larger than any realistic population size.|To support the study of how optimization algorithms handle large sets of optima, we propose the test function EQUALBLOCKS-ONEMAX (EBOM). It has an easy to optimize fitness landscape, however, with an exponential number of optima. We show that the bivariate EDA mutual-information-maximizing input clustering (MIMIC), without any problem-specific modification, quickly generates a model that behaves very similarly to a theoretically ideal model for that function, which samples each of the exponentially many optima with the same maximal probability.",

With the traffic network getting more and more complex, there have been increasing research interests in employing intelligent algorithms to find proper settings for traffic signals. As a special type of evolutionary algorithms, estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) possess strong optimization ability but have seldom been used in traffic signal optimization. In this paper, two efficient variants of continuous EDAs, namely EDA with variance enlargement strategy (EDA(ve)) and EDA with variable-width histogram model (EDA-VWH), are modified and adopted as optimizers to find proper traffic signal cycles in an actual urban area with multiple intersections. The performances of the two resultant algorithms, i.e. modified EDAve (mEDA(ve)) and modified EDA-VWH (mEDA-VWH), are comprehensively studied through a VISSIM-MATLAB integrated simulation platform, which could provide a convenient and close-to-reality simulation environment. The simulation results showed that mEDAve and mEDA-VWH could effectively reduce the mean delay time of all vehicles under different traffic conditions. In comparison with four other algorithms, including genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, differential evolution and random search method, the two modified EDAs also achieved competitive results.",

Analogous to genetic drift in EAs, EDAs also encounter the phenomenon that the random sampling in the model update can move the sampling frequencies to boundary values not justified by the fitness. This can result in a considerable performance loss. This article gives the first tight quantification of this effect for three EDAs and one ant colony optimizer, namely, for the univariate marginal distribution algorithm, the compact genetic algorithm, population-based incremental learning, and the max-min ant system with iteration-best update. Our results allow to choose the parameters of these algorithms in such a way that within a desired runtime, no sampling frequency approaches the boundary values without a clear indication from the objective function.",

        "description": "Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) are metaheuristics where learning a model and sampling new solutions replaces the variation operators recombination and mutation used in standard Genetic Algorithms. The choice of these models as well as the corresponding training processes are subject to the bias/variance tradeoff, also known as under- and overfitting: simple models cannot capture complex interactions between problem variables, whereas complex models are susceptible to modeling random noise. This paper suggests using Denoising Autoencoders (DAEs) as generative models within EDAs (DAE-EDA). The resulting DAE-EDA is able to model complex probability distributions. Furthermore, overfitting is less harmful, since DAEs overfit by learning the identity function. This overfitting behavior introduces unbiased random noise into the samples, which is no major problem for the EDA but just leads to higher population diversity. As a result, DAE-EDA runs for more generations before convergence and searches promising parts of the solution space more thoroughly. We study the performance of DAE-EDA on several combinatorial single-objective optimization problems. In comparison to the Bayesian Optimization Algorithm, DAE-EDA requires a similar number of evaluations of the objective function but is much faster and can be parallelized efficiently, making it the preferred choice especially for large and difficult optimization problems.",

The former shows that under a natural assumption, our algorithm has a performance similar to the one obtainable from the best population size. The latter confirms that missing the right population size can be highly detrimental and shows that our algorithm as well as a previously proposed parameter-less one based on parallel runs avoids such pitfalls. Comparing the two approaches, ours profits from its ability to abort runs which are likely to be stuck in a genetic drift situation.",

DAE-LSTMs are artificial neural networks that first learn the properties of a parent population by mapping promising candidate solutions to a latent space and reconstructing the candidate solutions from the latent space. The trained model is then used to sample new offspring solutions. We show on a generalization of the royal tree problem that DAE-GP outperforms standard GP and that performance differences increase with higher problem complexity. Furthermore, DAE-GP is able to create offspring with higher fitness from a learned model in comparison to standard GP. We believe that the key reason for the high performance of DAE-GP is that we do not impose any assumptions about the relationships between learned variables which is different to previous EDA-GP models.

Information about linkage identifies a subgroup of genes that are found dependent on each other. If such information is precise and properly used, it may significantly improve a method's effectiveness. The recent research shows that to solve problems with so-called overlapping blocks, it is not enough to use linkage of high quality - it is also necessary to use many different linkages that are diverse. Taking into account that the overlapping nature of problem structure is typical for practical problems, it is important to propose methods that are capable of gathering many different linkages (preferably of high quality) to keep them diverse. One of such methods is a Parameter-less Population Pyramid (P3) that was shown highly effective for overlapping problems in binary domains. Since P3 does not apply to permutation optimization problems, we propose a new P3-based method to fill this gap. Our proposition, namely the Parameter-less Population Pyramid for Permutations (P4), is compared with the state-of-the-art methods dedicated to solving permutation optimization problems: Generalized Mallows Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (GM-EDA) and Linkage Tree Gene-pool Optimal Mixing Evolutionary Algorithm (LT-GOMEA) for Permutation Spaces.

        "description": "In the field of stochastic optimisation, the so-called structural bias constitutes an undesired behaviour of an algorithm that is unable to explore the search space to a uniform extent. In this paper, we investigate whether algorithms from a subclass of estimation of distribution algorithms, the compact algorithms, exhibit structural bias. Our approach, justified in our earlier publications, is based on conducting experiments on a test function whose values are uniformly distributed in its domain. For the experiment, 81 combinations of compact algorithms and strategies of dealing with infeasible solutions have been selected as test cases. We have applied two approaches for determining the presence and severity of structural bias, namely an (existing) visual and an (updated) statistical (Anderson-Darling) test. Our results suggest that compact algorithms are more immune to structural bias than their counterparts maintaining explicit populations. Both tests indicate that strong structural bias is found only in the cBFO algorithm, regardless of the choice of strategy of dealing with infeasible solutions, and cPSO with mirror strategy. For other test cases, statistical and visual tests disagree on some cases classified as having mild or strong structural bias: the former one tends to make harsher decisions, thus needing further investigation.",

        "description": "AutoClustering is a computational tool for the automatic generation of clustering algorithms, which combines and evaluates the main parts of density-based algorithms to generate more appropriate solutions for a given dataset for clustering tasks. AutoClustering uses the Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDA) evolutionary technique to create the algorithms (individuals), and the adapted CLEST method (originally determines the best number of groups for a dataset) to compute individual fitness, using a decision-tree classifier. Thus, as the motivation to improve the quality of the results generated by AutoClustering, and to avoid possible bias by the adoption of a classifier, this work proposes to increase the efficiency of the evaluation process by the addition of a quality metric based on a fusion of three quality indexes of solution clusters. The three quality indexes are Silhouette, Dunn, and Davies-Bouldin, which assess the situation Intra and Inter clusters, with algorithms based on distance and independent of the generation of the groups. A final score for a specific solution (algorithm + parameters) is the average of normalized quality metric and normalized fitness. Besides, the results of the proposal presented solutions with higher cluster quality metrics, higher fitness average, and higher diversity of generated individuals (clustering algorithms) when compared with traditional Autocluestering.",

        "description": "In this article, an effective method, called an adaptive covariance strategy based on reference points (RPCMA-ES) is proposed for multi-objective optimization. In the proposed algorithm, search space is divided into independent sub-regions by calculating the angle between the objective vector and the reference vector. The reference vectors can be used not only to decompose the original multi-objective optimization problem into a number of single-objective subproblems, but also to elucidate user preferences to target a preferred subset of the whole Pareto front (PF). In this respect, any single objective optimizers can be easily used in this algorithm framework. Inspired by the multi-objective estimation of distribution algorithms, covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) is involved in RPCMA-ES. A state-of-the-art optimizer for single-objective continuous functions is the CMA-ES, which has proven to be able to strike a good balance between the exploration and the exploitation of search space. Furthermore, in order to avoid falling into local optimality and make the new mean closer to the optimal solution, chaos operator is added based on CMA-ES. By comparing it with four state-of-the-art multi-objective optimization algorithms, the simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is competitive and effective in terms of convergence and distribution.",

One of the most used methods for segmentation is thresholding which can be formulated as an optimization problem, and evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are alternatives commonly applied to solve it. Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) is a branch of EAs that explores the search space by building a probabilistic model, such as Bayesian Networks (BNs). In this article is proposed a BN-based EDA for multilevel image segmentation called BNMTH. The proposed approach iteratively selects the combination of thresholding techniques that permits to find the best configuration of thresholds for a digital image, exploring the inter-dependencies between the decision variables (thresholds) and the different techniques. BNMTH is applied over a set of benchmark images and the results of the segmentation are qualitatively analyzed by using the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), the Structure Similarity Index (SSIM) and the Feature Similarity Index (FSIM). Besides, a statistical analysis is provided to compare BNMTH with other state-of-the-art optimization algorithms. The results show that BNMTH is a competitive approach for image segmentation, providing accurate results in almost all the cases. Moreover, the segmented images and the histograms show that the classes are accurately generated even in complex conditions. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "description": "Compact optimization is an alternative paradigm in the field of metaheuristics requiring a modest use of memory to optimize a problem. As opposed to population-based algorithms, which conduct the search by employing a set of candidate solutions, compact algorithms use a probabilistic model to describe how solutions are distributed over the search space. Compared to other Estimation of Distribution Algorithms, peculiar features such as the use of simple probabilistic models, in which variables are treated independently, and the need for a minimal number of solutions to be sampled to perform the search, make these algorithms suitable for those applications plagued by memory limitations. Compact algorithms show good results on different kinds of optimization problems but often prematurely converge and perform poorly on non-separable. In this paper, we attempt to overcome these limitations by combining compact algorithms with a restart mechanism named Re-Sampled Inheritance (RI) whose purpose is to avoid premature convergence while also inheriting parts of the variables from the best solution found so far. To assess the effect of the RI mechanism, we extensively test various existing compact algorithms, with and without RI, and compare the best RI-based compact algorithm against several competing algorithms on several optimization problems at different dimensionalities. We also evaluate the effect of the RI parameters on the overall algorithmic performance. Our numerical results not only show that RI consistently enhances the performances of compact algorithms, but also shed some light on the effectiveness of different compact logics at handling problems at different dimensionalities.

We show that unlike most other optimization paradigms, it is stable in the sense that neutral bit values are sampled with probability close to 1/2 for a long time. This is generally a desirable property, however, it makes it harder to find the optima for decision variables with small influence on the objective function. This can result in an optimization time exponential in the dimension when optimizing simple symmetric functions like OneMax. On the positive side, BDE quickly detects and optimizes the most important decision variables. For example, dominant bits converge to the optimal value in time logarithmic in the population size. This enables BDE to optimize the most important bits very fast. Overall, our results indicate that BDE is an interesting optimization paradigm having characteristics significantly different from classic evolutionary algorithms or estimation-of-distribution algorithms (EDAs).|On the technical side, we observe that the strong stochastic dependencies in the random experiment describing a run of BDE prevent us from proving all desired results with the mathematical rigor that was successfully used in the analysis of other evolutionary algorithms. Inspired by mean-field approaches in statistical physics we propose a more independent variant of BDE, show experimentally its similarity to BDE, and prove some statements rigorously only for the independent variant. Such a semi-rigorous approach might be interesting for other problems in evolutionary computation where purely mathematical methods failed so far. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

In this paper, the estimation of distribution algorithms are used to solve nonlinear continuous optimization problems that contain noise. One common approach to dealing with these problems is to combine sampling methods with optimal search methods. Sampling techniques have a serious problem when the sample size is small, so estimating the objective function values with noise is not accurate in this case. In this research, a new sampling technique is proposed based on fuzzy logic to deal with small sample sizes. Then, simulation-based optimization methods are designed by combining the estimation of distribution algorithms with the proposed sampling technique and other sampling techniques to solve the stochastic programming problems. Moreover, additive versions of the proposed methods are developed to optimize functions without noise in order to evaluate different efficiency levels of the proposed methods. In order to test the performance of the proposed methods, different numerical experiments were carried out using several benchmark test functions.

Such a model is able to implicitly represent a solution set that is far larger than any realistic population size.|To support the study of how optimization algorithms handle large sets of optima, we propose the test function EQUALBLOCKS-ONEMAX (EBOM). It has an easy to optimize fitness landscape, however, with an exponential number of optima.

With the traffic network getting more and more complex, there have been increasing research interests in employing intelligent algorithms to find proper settings for traffic signals. As a special type of evolutionary algorithms, estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) possess strong optimization ability but have seldom been used in traffic signal optimization. In this paper, two efficient variants of continuous EDAs, namely EDA with variance enlargement strategy (EDA(ve)) and EDA with variable-width histogram model (EDA-VWH), are modified and adopted as optimizers to find proper traffic signal cycles in an actual urban area with multiple intersections. The performances of the two resultant algorithms, i.e. modified EDAve (mEDA(ve)) and modified EDA-VWH (mEDA-VWH), are comprehensively studied through a VISSIM-MATLAB integrated simulation platform, which could provide a convenient and close-to-reality simulation environment. The simulation results showed that mEDAve and mEDA-VWH could effectively reduce the mean delay time of all vehicles under different traffic conditions. In comparison with four other algorithms, including genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, differential evolution and random search method, the two modified EDAs also achieved competitive results.",

This can result in a considerable performance loss.

        "description": "Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) are metaheuristics where learning a model and sampling new solutions replaces the variation operators recombination and mutation used in standard Genetic Algorithms. The choice of these models as well as the corresponding training processes are subject to the bias/variance tradeoff, also known as under- and overfitting: simple models cannot capture complex interactions between problem variables, whereas complex models are susceptible to modeling random noise. This paper suggests using Denoising Autoencoders (DAEs) as generative models within EDAs (DAE-EDA). The resulting DAE-EDA is able to model complex probability distributions. Furthermore, overfitting is less harmful, since DAEs overfit by learning the identity function. This overfitting behavior introduces unbiased random noise into the samples, which is no major problem for the EDA but just leads to higher population diversity. As a result, DAE-EDA runs for more generations before convergence and searches promising parts of the solution space more thoroughly. We study the performance of DAE-EDA on several combinatorial single-objective optimization problems. In comparison to the Bayesian Optimization Algorithm, DAE-EDA requires a similar number of evaluations of the objective function but is much faster and can be parallelized efficiently, making it the preferred choice especially for large and difficult optimization problems.",

The former shows that under a natural assumption, our algorithm has a performance similar to the one obtainable from the best population size. The latter confirms that missing the right population size can be highly detrimental and shows that our algorithm as well as a previously proposed parameter-less one based on parallel runs avoids such pitfalls.

Furthermore, DAE-GP is able to create offspring with higher fitness from a learned model in comparison to standard GP.

Information about linkage identifies a subgroup of genes that are found dependent on each other. If such information is precise and properly used, it may significantly improve a method's effectiveness. The recent research shows that to solve problems with so-called overlapping blocks, it is not enough to use linkage of high quality - it is also necessary to use many different linkages that are diverse. Taking into account that the overlapping nature of problem structure is typical for practical problems, it is important to propose methods that are capable of gathering many different linkages (preferably of high quality) to keep them diverse. One of such methods is a Parameter-less Population Pyramid (P3) that was shown highly effective for overlapping problems in binary domains. Since P3 does not apply to permutation optimization problems, we propose a new P3-based method to fill this gap. Our proposition, namely the Parameter-less Population Pyramid for Permutations (P4), is compared with the state-of-the-art methods dedicated to solving permutation optimization problems: Generalized Mallows Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (GM-EDA) and Linkage Tree Gene-pool Optimal Mixing Evolutionary Algorithm (LT-GOMEA) for Permutation Spaces.

In this study a new evolutionary metaheuristic approach \"The Integration of Variables Method (IVM)\" is devised for global optimization, that methodology is characterized by making vide solutions codes in an objective population aided by any composition of operators. The Genetic Algorithms (GA) are incorporated in this methodology; where genetic operators are used to evolve populations classifiers in creation of new concrete heuristics solutions for decision making tasks. In this work, the main consideration is devoted to the exploration of Extremes value distribution of Functions with multi Variables Codes in brain decision making process and Brain Computer Interface (BCI) tasks. The properties of Extremes value distribution algorithm are characterized by the diversity of measurements in populations of available solutions. Additionally, while generating adequate solutions of the basic objectives, subjective indicators of human-machine interaction are used to differentiate the characteristics of the different solutions in a population. The results obtained from this metaheuristic approach are compared with results of Genetic Algorithms (GA) in case study related with Optimal Multiple Objective Design and Progressive Cutting Dies implemented in a CAD system.",

        "description": "In the field of stochastic optimisation, the so-called structural bias constitutes an undesired behaviour of an algorithm that is unable to explore the search space to a uniform extent. In this paper, we investigate whether algorithms from a subclass of estimation of distribution algorithms, the compact algorithms, exhibit structural bias. Our approach, justified in our earlier publications, is based on conducting experiments on a test function whose values are uniformly distributed in its domain. For the experiment, 81 combinations of compact algorithms and strategies of dealing with infeasible solutions have been selected as test cases. We have applied two approaches for determining the presence and severity of structural bias, namely an (existing) visual and an (updated) statistical (Anderson-Darling) test. Our results suggest that compact algorithms are more immune to structural bias than their counterparts maintaining explicit populations. Both tests indicate that strong structural bias is found only in the cBFO algorithm, regardless of the choice of strategy of dealing with infeasible solutions, and cPSO with mirror strategy. For other test cases, statistical and visual tests disagree on some cases classified as having mild or strong structural bias: the former one tends to make harsher decisions, thus needing further investigation.",

        "description": "AutoClustering is a computational tool for the automatic generation of clustering algorithms, which combines and evaluates the main parts of density-based algorithms to generate more appropriate solutions for a given dataset for clustering tasks. AutoClustering uses the Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDA) evolutionary technique to create the algorithms (individuals), and the adapted CLEST method (originally determines the best number of groups for a dataset) to compute individual fitness, using a decision-tree classifier. Thus, as the motivation to improve the quality of the results generated by AutoClustering, and to avoid possible bias by the adoption of a classifier, this work proposes to increase the efficiency of the evaluation process by the addition of a quality metric based on a fusion of three quality indexes of solution clusters. The three quality indexes are Silhouette, Dunn, and Davies-Bouldin, which assess the situation Intra and Inter clusters, with algorithms based on distance and independent of the generation of the groups. A final score for a specific solution (algorithm + parameters) is the average of normalized quality metric and normalized fitness. Besides, the results of the proposal presented solutions with higher cluster quality metrics, higher fitness average, and higher diversity of generated individuals (clustering algorithms) when compared with traditional Autocluestering.",

In the proposed algorithm, search space is divided into independent sub-regions by calculating the angle between the objective vector and the reference vector. The reference vectors can be used not only to decompose the original multi-objective optimization problem into a number of single-objective subproblems, but also to elucidate user preferences to target a preferred subset of the whole Pareto front (PF). In this respect, any single objective optimizers can be easily used in this algorithm framework. Inspired by the multi-objective estimation of distribution algorithms, covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) is involved in RPCMA-ES. A state-of-the-art optimizer for single-objective continuous functions is the CMA-ES, which has proven to be able to strike a good balance between the exploration and the exploitation of search space. Furthermore, in order to avoid falling into local optimality and make the new mean closer to the optimal solution, chaos operator is added based on CMA-ES. By comparing it with four state-of-the-art multi-objective optimization algorithms, the simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is competitive and effective in terms of convergence and distribution.",

One of the most used methods for segmentation is thresholding which can be formulated as an optimization problem, and evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are alternatives commonly applied to solve it. Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) is a branch of EAs that explores the search space by building a probabilistic model, such as Bayesian Networks (BNs). In this article is proposed a BN-based EDA for multilevel image segmentation called BNMTH. The proposed approach iteratively selects the combination of thresholding techniques that permits to find the best configuration of thresholds for a digital image, exploring the inter-dependencies between the decision variables (thresholds) and the different techniques. BNMTH is applied over a set of benchmark images and the results of the segmentation are qualitatively analyzed by using the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), the Structure Similarity Index (SSIM) and the Feature Similarity Index (FSIM). Besides, a statistical analysis is provided to compare BNMTH with other state-of-the-art optimization algorithms. The results show that BNMTH is a competitive approach for image segmentation, providing accurate results in almost all the cases. Moreover, the segmented images and the histograms show that the classes are accurately generated even in complex conditions. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "description": "Compact optimization is an alternative paradigm in the field of metaheuristics requiring a modest use of memory to optimize a problem. As opposed to population-based algorithms, which conduct the search by employing a set of candidate solutions, compact algorithms use a probabilistic model to describe how solutions are distributed over the search space. Compared to other Estimation of Distribution Algorithms, peculiar features such as the use of simple probabilistic models, in which variables are treated independently, and the need for a minimal number of solutions to be sampled to perform the search, make these algorithms suitable for those applications plagued by memory limitations. Compact algorithms show good results on different kinds of optimization problems but often prematurely converge and perform poorly on non-separable. In this paper, we attempt to overcome these limitations by combining compact algorithms with a restart mechanism named Re-Sampled Inheritance (RI) whose purpose is to avoid premature convergence while also inheriting parts of the variables from the best solution found so far. To assess the effect of the RI mechanism, we extensively test various existing compact algorithms, with and without RI, and compare the best RI-based compact algorithm against several competing algorithms on several optimization problems at different dimensionalities. We also evaluate the effect of the RI parameters on the overall algorithmic performance. Our numerical results not only show that RI consistently enhances the performances of compact algorithms, but also shed some light on the effectiveness of different compact logics at handling problems at different dimensionalities.

We show that unlike most other optimization paradigms, it is stable in the sense that neutral bit values are sampled with probability close to 1/2 for a long time. This is generally a desirable property, however, it makes it harder to find the optima for decision variables with small influence on the objective function. This can result in an optimization time exponential in the dimension when optimizing simple symmetric functions like OneMax. On the positive side, BDE quickly detects and optimizes the most important decision variables. For example, dominant bits converge to the optimal value in time logarithmic in the population size. This enables BDE to optimize the most important bits very fast. Overall, our results indicate that BDE is an interesting optimization paradigm having characteristics significantly different from classic evolutionary algorithms or estimation-of-distribution algorithms (EDAs).|On the technical side, we observe that the strong stochastic dependencies in the random experiment describing a run of BDE prevent us from proving all desired results with the mathematical rigor that was successfully used in the analysis of other evolutionary algorithms. Inspired by mean-field approaches in statistical physics we propose a more independent variant of BDE, show experimentally its similarity to BDE, and prove some statements rigorously only for the independent variant. Such a semi-rigorous approach might be interesting for other problems in evolutionary computation where purely mathematical methods failed so far. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

In this paper, the estimation of distribution algorithms are used to solve nonlinear continuous optimization problems that contain noise. One common approach to dealing with these problems is to combine sampling methods with optimal search methods. Sampling techniques have a serious problem when the sample size is small, so estimating the objective function values with noise is not accurate in this case. In this research, a new sampling technique is proposed based on fuzzy logic to deal with small sample sizes. Then, simulation-based optimization methods are designed by combining the estimation of distribution algorithms with the proposed sampling technique and other sampling techniques to solve the stochastic programming problems. Moreover, additive versions of the proposed methods are developed to optimize functions without noise in order to evaluate different efficiency levels of the proposed methods. In order to test the performance of the proposed methods, different numerical experiments were carried out using several benchmark test functions.

Such a model is able to implicitly represent a solution set that is far larger than any realistic population size.|To support the study of how optimization algorithms handle large sets of optima, we propose the test function EQUALBLOCKS-ONEMAX (EBOM). It has an easy to optimize fitness landscape, however, with an exponential number of optima.

With the traffic network getting more and more complex, there have been increasing research interests in employing intelligent algorithms to find proper settings for traffic signals. As a special type of evolutionary algorithms, estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) possess strong optimization ability but have seldom been used in traffic signal optimization. In this paper, two efficient variants of continuous EDAs, namely EDA with variance enlargement strategy (EDA(ve)) and EDA with variable-width histogram model (EDA-VWH), are modified and adopted as optimizers to find proper traffic signal cycles in an actual urban area with multiple intersections. The performances of the two resultant algorithms, i.e. modified EDAve (mEDA(ve)) and modified EDA-VWH (mEDA-VWH), are comprehensively studied through a VISSIM-MATLAB integrated simulation platform, which could provide a convenient and close-to-reality simulation environment. The simulation results showed that mEDAve and mEDA-VWH could effectively reduce the mean delay time of all vehicles under different traffic conditions. In comparison with four other algorithms, including genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, differential evolution and random search method, the two modified EDAs also achieved competitive results.",

This can result in a considerable performance loss.

        "description": "Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) are metaheuristics where learning a model and sampling new solutions replaces the variation operators recombination and mutation used in standard Genetic Algorithms. The choice of these models as well as the corresponding training processes are subject to the bias/variance tradeoff, also known as under- and overfitting: simple models cannot capture complex interactions between problem variables, whereas complex models are susceptible to modeling random noise. This paper suggests using Denoising Autoencoders (DAEs) as generative models within EDAs (DAE-EDA). The resulting DAE-EDA is able to model complex probability distributions. Furthermore, overfitting is less harmful, since DAEs overfit by learning the identity function. This overfitting behavior introduces unbiased random noise into the samples, which is no major problem for the EDA but just leads to higher population diversity. As a result, DAE-EDA runs for more generations before convergence and searches promising parts of the solution space more thoroughly. We study the performance of DAE-EDA on several combinatorial single-objective optimization problems. In comparison to the Bayesian Optimization Algorithm, DAE-EDA requires a similar number of evaluations of the objective function but is much faster and can be parallelized efficiently, making it the preferred choice especially for large and difficult optimization problems.",

The former shows that under a natural assumption, our algorithm has a performance similar to the one obtainable from the best population size. The latter confirms that missing the right population size can be highly detrimental and shows that our algorithm as well as a previously proposed parameter-less one based on parallel runs avoids such pitfalls.

DAE-LSTMs are artificial neural networks that first learn the properties of a parent population by mapping promising candidate solutions to a latent space and reconstructing the candidate solutions from the latent space. The trained model is then used to sample new offspring solutions.

Furthermore, DAE-GP is able to create offspring with higher fitness from a learned model in comparison to standard GP. We believe that the key reason for the high performance of DAE-GP is that we do not impose any assumptions about the relationships between learned variables which is different to previous EDA-GP models.

Information about linkage identifies a subgroup of genes that are found dependent on each other. If such information is precise and properly used, it may significantly improve a method's effectiveness. The recent research shows that to solve problems with so-called overlapping blocks, it is not enough to use linkage of high quality - it is also necessary to use many different linkages that are diverse. Taking into account that the overlapping nature of problem structure is typical for practical problems, it is important to propose methods that are capable of gathering many different linkages (preferably of high quality) to keep them diverse. One of such methods is a Parameter-less Population Pyramid (P3) that was shown highly effective for overlapping problems in binary domains. Since P3 does not apply to permutation optimization problems, we propose a new P3-based method to fill this gap. Our proposition, namely the Parameter-less Population Pyramid for Permutations (P4), is compared with the state-of-the-art methods dedicated to solving permutation optimization problems: Generalized Mallows Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (GM-EDA) and Linkage Tree Gene-pool Optimal Mixing Evolutionary Algorithm (LT-GOMEA) for Permutation Spaces.

As a result, a large number of algorithms have been proposed to tackle this problem. Among these, exact methods are only able to solve instances of size n < 40. To overcome this limitation, many metaheuristic methods have been applied to the QAP. In this work, we follow this direction by approaching the QAP through Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs). Particularly, a non-parametric distance-based exponential probabilistic model is used. Based on the analysis of the characteristics of the QAP, and previous work in the area, we introduce Kernels of Mallows Model under the Hamming distance to the context of EDAs. Conducted experiments point out that the performance of the proposed algorithm in the QAP is superior to (i) the classical EDAs adapted to deal with the QAP, and also (ii) to the specific EDAs proposed in the literature to deal with permutation problems.",

In this study a new evolutionary metaheuristic approach \"The Integration of Variables Method (IVM)\" is devised for global optimization, that methodology is characterized by making vide solutions codes in an objective population aided by any composition of operators. The Genetic Algorithms (GA) are incorporated in this methodology; where genetic operators are used to evolve populations classifiers in creation of new concrete heuristics solutions for decision making tasks. In this work, the main consideration is devoted to the exploration of Extremes value distribution of Functions with multi Variables Codes in brain decision making process and Brain Computer Interface (BCI) tasks. The properties of Extremes value distribution algorithm are characterized by the diversity of measurements in populations of available solutions. Additionally, while generating adequate solutions of the basic objectives, subjective indicators of human-machine interaction are used to differentiate the characteristics of the different solutions in a population. The results obtained from this metaheuristic approach are compared with results of Genetic Algorithms (GA) in case study related with Optimal Multiple Objective Design and Progressive Cutting Dies implemented in a CAD system.",

        "description": "In the field of stochastic optimisation, the so-called structural bias constitutes an undesired behaviour of an algorithm that is unable to explore the search space to a uniform extent. In this paper, we investigate whether algorithms from a subclass of estimation of distribution algorithms, the compact algorithms, exhibit structural bias. Our approach, justified in our earlier publications, is based on conducting experiments on a test function whose values are uniformly distributed in its domain. For the experiment, 81 combinations of compact algorithms and strategies of dealing with infeasible solutions have been selected as test cases. We have applied two approaches for determining the presence and severity of structural bias, namely an (existing) visual and an (updated) statistical (Anderson-Darling) test. Our results suggest that compact algorithms are more immune to structural bias than their counterparts maintaining explicit populations. Both tests indicate that strong structural bias is found only in the cBFO algorithm, regardless of the choice of strategy of dealing with infeasible solutions, and cPSO with mirror strategy. For other test cases, statistical and visual tests disagree on some cases classified as having mild or strong structural bias: the former one tends to make harsher decisions, thus needing further investigation.",

        "description": "AutoClustering is a computational tool for the automatic generation of clustering algorithms, which combines and evaluates the main parts of density-based algorithms to generate more appropriate solutions for a given dataset for clustering tasks. AutoClustering uses the Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDA) evolutionary technique to create the algorithms (individuals), and the adapted CLEST method (originally determines the best number of groups for a dataset) to compute individual fitness, using a decision-tree classifier. Thus, as the motivation to improve the quality of the results generated by AutoClustering, and to avoid possible bias by the adoption of a classifier, this work proposes to increase the efficiency of the evaluation process by the addition of a quality metric based on a fusion of three quality indexes of solution clusters. The three quality indexes are Silhouette, Dunn, and Davies-Bouldin, which assess the situation Intra and Inter clusters, with algorithms based on distance and independent of the generation of the groups. A final score for a specific solution (algorithm + parameters) is the average of normalized quality metric and normalized fitness. Besides, the results of the proposal presented solutions with higher cluster quality metrics, higher fitness average, and higher diversity of generated individuals (clustering algorithms) when compared with traditional Autocluestering.",

In the proposed algorithm, search space is divided into independent sub-regions by calculating the angle between the objective vector and the reference vector. The reference vectors can be used not only to decompose the original multi-objective optimization problem into a number of single-objective subproblems, but also to elucidate user preferences to target a preferred subset of the whole Pareto front (PF). In this respect, any single objective optimizers can be easily used in this algorithm framework. Inspired by the multi-objective estimation of distribution algorithms, covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) is involved in RPCMA-ES. A state-of-the-art optimizer for single-objective continuous functions is the CMA-ES, which has proven to be able to strike a good balance between the exploration and the exploitation of search space. Furthermore, in order to avoid falling into local optimality and make the new mean closer to the optimal solution, chaos operator is added based on CMA-ES. By comparing it with four state-of-the-art multi-objective optimization algorithms, the simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is competitive and effective in terms of convergence and distribution.",

One of the most used methods for segmentation is thresholding which can be formulated as an optimization problem, and evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are alternatives commonly applied to solve it. Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) is a branch of EAs that explores the search space by building a probabilistic model, such as Bayesian Networks (BNs). In this article is proposed a BN-based EDA for multilevel image segmentation called BNMTH. The proposed approach iteratively selects the combination of thresholding techniques that permits to find the best configuration of thresholds for a digital image, exploring the inter-dependencies between the decision variables (thresholds) and the different techniques. BNMTH is applied over a set of benchmark images and the results of the segmentation are qualitatively analyzed by using the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), the Structure Similarity Index (SSIM) and the Feature Similarity Index (FSIM). Besides, a statistical analysis is provided to compare BNMTH with other state-of-the-art optimization algorithms. The results show that BNMTH is a competitive approach for image segmentation, providing accurate results in almost all the cases. Moreover, the segmented images and the histograms show that the classes are accurately generated even in complex conditions. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "description": "Compact optimization is an alternative paradigm in the field of metaheuristics requiring a modest use of memory to optimize a problem. As opposed to population-based algorithms, which conduct the search by employing a set of candidate solutions, compact algorithms use a probabilistic model to describe how solutions are distributed over the search space. Compared to other Estimation of Distribution Algorithms, peculiar features such as the use of simple probabilistic models, in which variables are treated independently, and the need for a minimal number of solutions to be sampled to perform the search, make these algorithms suitable for those applications plagued by memory limitations. Compact algorithms show good results on different kinds of optimization problems but often prematurely converge and perform poorly on non-separable. In this paper, we attempt to overcome these limitations by combining compact algorithms with a restart mechanism named Re-Sampled Inheritance (RI) whose purpose is to avoid premature convergence while also inheriting parts of the variables from the best solution found so far. To assess the effect of the RI mechanism, we extensively test various existing compact algorithms, with and without RI, and compare the best RI-based compact algorithm against several competing algorithms on several optimization problems at different dimensionalities. We also evaluate the effect of the RI parameters on the overall algorithmic performance. Our numerical results not only show that RI consistently enhances the performances of compact algorithms, but also shed some light on the effectiveness of different compact logics at handling problems at different dimensionalities.

        "description": "We conduct a first fundamental analysis of the working principles of binary differential evolution (BDE), an optimization heuristic for binary decision variables that was derived by Gong and Tuson (2007) from the very successful classic differential evolution (DE) for continuous optimization. We show that unlike most other optimization paradigms, it is stable in the sense that neutral bit values are sampled with probability close to 1/2 for a long time. This is generally a desirable property, however, it makes it harder to find the optima for decision variables with small influence on the objective function. This can result in an optimization time exponential in the dimension when optimizing simple symmetric functions like OneMax. On the positive side, BDE quickly detects and optimizes the most important decision variables. For example, dominant bits converge to the optimal value in time logarithmic in the population size. This enables BDE to optimize the most important bits very fast. Overall, our results indicate that BDE is an interesting optimization paradigm having characteristics significantly different from classic evolutionary algorithms or estimation-of-distribution algorithms (EDAs).|On the technical side, we observe that the strong stochastic dependencies in the random experiment describing a run of BDE prevent us from proving all desired results with the mathematical rigor that was successfully used in the analysis of other evolutionary algorithms. Inspired by mean-field approaches in statistical physics we propose a more independent variant of BDE, show experimentally its similarity to BDE, and prove some statements rigorously only for the independent variant. Such a semi-rigorous approach might be interesting for other problems in evolutionary computation where purely mathematical methods failed so far. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

In this paper, the estimation of distribution algorithms are used to solve nonlinear continuous optimization problems that contain noise. One common approach to dealing with these problems is to combine sampling methods with optimal search methods. Sampling techniques have a serious problem when the sample size is small, so estimating the objective function values with noise is not accurate in this case. In this research, a new sampling technique is proposed based on fuzzy logic to deal with small sample sizes. Then, simulation-based optimization methods are designed by combining the estimation of distribution algorithms with the proposed sampling technique and other sampling techniques to solve the stochastic programming problems. Moreover, additive versions of the proposed methods are developed to optimize functions without noise in order to evaluate different efficiency levels of the proposed methods. In order to test the performance of the proposed methods, different numerical experiments were carried out using several benchmark test functions. Finally, three real-world applications are considered to assess the performance of the proposed methods.",

Such a model is able to implicitly represent a solution set that is far larger than any realistic population size.|To support the study of how optimization algorithms handle large sets of optima, we propose the test function EQUALBLOCKS-ONEMAX (EBOM). It has an easy to optimize fitness landscape, however, with an exponential number of optima. We show that the bivariate EDA mutual-information-maximizing input clustering (MIMIC), without any problem-specific modification, quickly generates a model that behaves very similarly to a theoretically ideal model for that function, which samples each of the exponentially many optima with the same maximal probability.",

With the traffic network getting more and more complex, there have been increasing research interests in employing intelligent algorithms to find proper settings for traffic signals. As a special type of evolutionary algorithms, estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) possess strong optimization ability but have seldom been used in traffic signal optimization. In this paper, two efficient variants of continuous EDAs, namely EDA with variance enlargement strategy (EDA(ve)) and EDA with variable-width histogram model (EDA-VWH), are modified and adopted as optimizers to find proper traffic signal cycles in an actual urban area with multiple intersections. The performances of the two resultant algorithms, i.e. modified EDAve (mEDA(ve)) and modified EDA-VWH (mEDA-VWH), are comprehensively studied through a VISSIM-MATLAB integrated simulation platform, which could provide a convenient and close-to-reality simulation environment. The simulation results showed that mEDAve and mEDA-VWH could effectively reduce the mean delay time of all vehicles under different traffic conditions. In comparison with four other algorithms, including genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, differential evolution and random search method, the two modified EDAs also achieved competitive results.",

This can result in a considerable performance loss.

The choice of these models as well as the corresponding training processes are subject to the bias/variance tradeoff, also known as under- and overfitting: simple models cannot capture complex interactions between problem variables, whereas complex models are susceptible to modeling random noise. This paper suggests using Denoising Autoencoders (DAEs) as generative models within EDAs (DAE-EDA). The resulting DAE-EDA is able to model complex probability distributions. Furthermore, overfitting is less harmful, since DAEs overfit by learning the identity function. This overfitting behavior introduces unbiased random noise into the samples, which is no major problem for the EDA but just leads to higher population diversity. As a result, DAE-EDA runs for more generations before convergence and searches promising parts of the solution space more thoroughly. We study the performance of DAE-EDA on several combinatorial single-objective optimization problems. In comparison to the Bayesian Optimization Algorithm, DAE-EDA requires a similar number of evaluations of the objective function but is much faster and can be parallelized efficiently, making it the preferred choice especially for large and difficult optimization problems.",

The former shows that under a natural assumption, our algorithm has a performance similar to the one obtainable from the best population size. The latter confirms that missing the right population size can be highly detrimental and shows that our algorithm as well as a previously proposed parameter-less one based on parallel runs avoids such pitfalls.

DAE-LSTMs are artificial neural networks that first learn the properties of a parent population by mapping promising candidate solutions to a latent space and reconstructing the candidate solutions from the latent space. The trained model is then used to sample new offspring solutions.

Furthermore, DAE-GP is able to create offspring with higher fitness from a learned model in comparison to standard GP.

Information about linkage identifies a subgroup of genes that are found dependent on each other. If such information is precise and properly used, it may significantly improve a method's effectiveness. The recent research shows that to solve problems with so-called overlapping blocks, it is not enough to use linkage of high quality - it is also necessary to use many different linkages that are diverse. Taking into account that the overlapping nature of problem structure is typical for practical problems, it is important to propose methods that are capable of gathering many different linkages (preferably of high quality) to keep them diverse. One of such methods is a Parameter-less Population Pyramid (P3) that was shown highly effective for overlapping problems in binary domains. Since P3 does not apply to permutation optimization problems, we propose a new P3-based method to fill this gap. Our proposition, namely the Parameter-less Population Pyramid for Permutations (P4), is compared with the state-of-the-art methods dedicated to solving permutation optimization problems: Generalized Mallows Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (GM-EDA) and Linkage Tree Gene-pool Optimal Mixing Evolutionary Algorithm (LT-GOMEA) for Permutation Spaces.

In this paper, an Gaussian Bayesian network-based estimation of distribution algorithm (GBNEDA-DR) is proposed to effectively tackle continued large-scale MaOPs. In the proposed algorithm, dimension reduction technique (i.e. LPP) is employed in the decision space to speed up the estimation search of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs significantly better on many of the problems and for different decision space dimensions, and achieves comparable results on some compared with many existing algorithms.",

        "description": "The Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) is a well-known permutation-based combinatorial optimization problem with real applications in industrial and logistics environments. Motivated by the challenge that this NP-hard problem represents, it has captured the attention of the optimization community for decades. As a result, a large number of algorithms have been proposed to tackle this problem. Among these, exact methods are only able to solve instances of size n < 40. To overcome this limitation, many metaheuristic methods have been applied to the QAP. In this work, we follow this direction by approaching the QAP through Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs). Particularly, a non-parametric distance-based exponential probabilistic model is used. Based on the analysis of the characteristics of the QAP, and previous work in the area, we introduce Kernels of Mallows Model under the Hamming distance to the context of EDAs. Conducted experiments point out that the performance of the proposed algorithm in the QAP is superior to (i) the classical EDAs adapted to deal with the QAP, and also (ii) to the specific EDAs proposed in the literature to deal with permutation problems.",

        "description": "Metaheuristics is recognized as the most practical approach in simulation based global optimization and during investigation of the state-of-the-art optimization approaches from local searches over evolutionary computation methods to estimation of distribution algorithms. In this study a new evolutionary metaheuristic approach \"The Integration of Variables Method (IVM)\" is devised for global optimization, that methodology is characterized by making vide solutions codes in an objective population aided by any composition of operators. The Genetic Algorithms (GA) are incorporated in this methodology; where genetic operators are used to evolve populations classifiers in creation of new concrete heuristics solutions for decision making tasks. In this work, the main consideration is devoted to the exploration of Extremes value distribution of Functions with multi Variables Codes in brain decision making process and Brain Computer Interface (BCI) tasks. The properties of Extremes value distribution algorithm are characterized by the diversity of measurements in populations of available solutions. Additionally, while generating adequate solutions of the basic objectives, subjective indicators of human-machine interaction are used to differentiate the characteristics of the different solutions in a population. The results obtained from this metaheuristic approach are compared with results of Genetic Algorithms (GA) in case study related with Optimal Multiple Objective Design and Progressive Cutting Dies implemented in a CAD system.",

        "authors": "Kononova, AV, Caraffini, F, B\u00e4ck, T",
        "description": "In the field of stochastic optimisation, the so-called structural bias constitutes an undesired behaviour of an algorithm that is unable to explore the search space to a uniform extent. In this paper, we investigate whether algorithms from a subclass of estimation of distribution algorithms, the compact algorithms, exhibit structural bias. Our approach, justified in our earlier publications, is based on conducting experiments on a test function whose values are uniformly distributed in its domain. For the experiment, 81 combinations of compact algorithms and strategies of dealing with infeasible solutions have been selected as test cases. We have applied two approaches for determining the presence and severity of structural bias, namely an (existing) visual and an (updated) statistical (Anderson-Darling) test. Our results suggest that compact algorithms are more immune to structural bias than their counterparts maintaining explicit populations. Both tests indicate that strong structural bias is found only in the cBFO algorithm, regardless of the choice of strategy of dealing with infeasible solutions, and cPSO with mirror strategy. For other test cases, statistical and visual tests disagree on some cases classified as having mild or strong structural bias: the former one tends to make harsher decisions, thus needing further investigation.",

        "description": "AutoClustering is a computational tool for the automatic generation of clustering algorithms, which combines and evaluates the main parts of density-based algorithms to generate more appropriate solutions for a given dataset for clustering tasks. AutoClustering uses the Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDA) evolutionary technique to create the algorithms (individuals), and the adapted CLEST method (originally determines the best number of groups for a dataset) to compute individual fitness, using a decision-tree classifier. Thus, as the motivation to improve the quality of the results generated by AutoClustering, and to avoid possible bias by the adoption of a classifier, this work proposes to increase the efficiency of the evaluation process by the addition of a quality metric based on a fusion of three quality indexes of solution clusters. The three quality indexes are Silhouette, Dunn, and Davies-Bouldin, which assess the situation Intra and Inter clusters, with algorithms based on distance and independent of the generation of the groups. A final score for a specific solution (algorithm + parameters) is the average of normalized quality metric and normalized fitness. Besides, the results of the proposal presented solutions with higher cluster quality metrics, higher fitness average, and higher diversity of generated individuals (clustering algorithms) when compared with traditional Autocluestering.",

        "description": "In this article, an effective method, called an adaptive covariance strategy based on reference points (RPCMA-ES) is proposed for multi-objective optimization. In the proposed algorithm, search space is divided into independent sub-regions by calculating the angle between the objective vector and the reference vector. The reference vectors can be used not only to decompose the original multi-objective optimization problem into a number of single-objective subproblems, but also to elucidate user preferences to target a preferred subset of the whole Pareto front (PF). In this respect, any single objective optimizers can be easily used in this algorithm framework. Inspired by the multi-objective estimation of distribution algorithms, covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) is involved in RPCMA-ES. A state-of-the-art optimizer for single-objective continuous functions is the CMA-ES, which has proven to be able to strike a good balance between the exploration and the exploitation of search space. Furthermore, in order to avoid falling into local optimality and make the new mean closer to the optimal solution, chaos operator is added based on CMA-ES. By comparing it with four state-of-the-art multi-objective optimization algorithms, the simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is competitive and effective in terms of convergence and distribution.",

        "description": "Segmentation is an important task in image processing because it could affect the performance of other steps in image analysis. One of the most used methods for segmentation is thresholding which can be formulated as an optimization problem, and evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are alternatives commonly applied to solve it. Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) is a branch of EAs that explores the search space by building a probabilistic model, such as Bayesian Networks (BNs). In this article is proposed a BN-based EDA for multilevel image segmentation called BNMTH. The proposed approach iteratively selects the combination of thresholding techniques that permits to find the best configuration of thresholds for a digital image, exploring the inter-dependencies between the decision variables (thresholds) and the different techniques. BNMTH is applied over a set of benchmark images and the results of the segmentation are qualitatively analyzed by using the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), the Structure Similarity Index (SSIM) and the Feature Similarity Index (FSIM). Besides, a statistical analysis is provided to compare BNMTH with other state-of-the-art optimization algorithms. The results show that BNMTH is a competitive approach for image segmentation, providing accurate results in almost all the cases. Moreover, the segmented images and the histograms show that the classes are accurately generated even in complex conditions. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "authors": "Iacca, G and Caraffini, F",
        "description": "Compact optimization is an alternative paradigm in the field of metaheuristics requiring a modest use of memory to optimize a problem. As opposed to population-based algorithms, which conduct the search by employing a set of candidate solutions, compact algorithms use a probabilistic model to describe how solutions are distributed over the search space. Compared to other Estimation of Distribution Algorithms, peculiar features such as the use of simple probabilistic models, in which variables are treated independently, and the need for a minimal number of solutions to be sampled to perform the search, make these algorithms suitable for those applications plagued by memory limitations. Compact algorithms show good results on different kinds of optimization problems but often prematurely converge and perform poorly on non-separable. In this paper, we attempt to overcome these limitations by combining compact algorithms with a restart mechanism named Re-Sampled Inheritance (RI) whose purpose is to avoid premature convergence while also inheriting parts of the variables from the best solution found so far. To assess the effect of the RI mechanism, we extensively test various existing compact algorithms, with and without RI, and compare the best RI-based compact algorithm against several competing algorithms on several optimization problems at different dimensionalities. We also evaluate the effect of the RI parameters on the overall algorithmic performance. Our numerical results not only show that RI consistently enhances the performances of compact algorithms, but also shed some light on the effectiveness of different compact logics at handling problems at different dimensionalities.

        "description": "We conduct a first fundamental analysis of the working principles of binary differential evolution (BDE), an optimization heuristic for binary decision variables that was derived by Gong and Tuson (2007) from the very successful classic differential evolution (DE) for continuous optimization. We show that unlike most other optimization paradigms, it is stable in the sense that neutral bit values are sampled with probability close to 1/2 for a long time. This is generally a desirable property, however, it makes it harder to find the optima for decision variables with small influence on the objective function. This can result in an optimization time exponential in the dimension when optimizing simple symmetric functions like OneMax. On the positive side, BDE quickly detects and optimizes the most important decision variables. For example, dominant bits converge to the optimal value in time logarithmic in the population size. This enables BDE to optimize the most important bits very fast. Overall, our results indicate that BDE is an interesting optimization paradigm having characteristics significantly different from classic evolutionary algorithms or estimation-of-distribution algorithms (EDAs).|On the technical side, we observe that the strong stochastic dependencies in the random experiment describing a run of BDE prevent us from proving all desired results with the mathematical rigor that was successfully used in the analysis of other evolutionary algorithms. Inspired by mean-field approaches in statistical physics we propose a more independent variant of BDE, show experimentally its similarity to BDE, and prove some statements rigorously only for the independent variant. Such a semi-rigorous approach might be interesting for other problems in evolutionary computation where purely mathematical methods failed so far. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
