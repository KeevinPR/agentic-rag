        "description": "Differential Evolution (DE) is a simple yet efficient global optimization algorithm. However, the standard DE and most of its variants operate in the continuous space, which cannot solve the binary-coded optimization problems directly. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a novel modified binary differential evolution algorithm (NMBDE) inspired by the concept of Estimation of Distribution Algorithm and DE. A novel probability estimation operator is developed for NMBDE, which can efficiently maintain diversity of population and achieve a better tradeoff between the exploration and exploitation capabilities by cooperating with the selection operator. Furthermore, the parameter study of NMBDE is run and the analysis is performed to improve the global search ability and scalability of algorithm. The effectiveness and efficiency of NMBDE was verified in applications to the numerical optimization and multidimensional knapsack problems. The experimental results demonstrate that NMBDE has the better global search ability and outperforms the discrete binary DE, the modified binary DE, the discrete binary Particle Swarm Optimization and the binary Ant System in terms of accuracy and convergence speed.

        "description": "A regularity model-based multiobjective estimation of distribution algorithm (RM-MEDA) has been proposed for solving continuous multiobjective optimization problems with variable linkages. RM-MEDA is a kind of estimation of distribution algorithms and, therefore, modeling plays a critical role. In RM-MEDA, the population is split into several clusters to build the model. Moreover, the fixed number of clusters is recommended in RM-MEDA when solving different kinds of problems. However, based on our experiments, we find that the number of clusters is problem-dependent and has a significant effect on the performance of RM-MEDA. Motivated by the above observation, in this paper we improve the clustering process and propose a reducing redundant cluster operator (RRCO) to build more precise model during the evolution. By combining RRCO with RM-MEDA, we present an improved version of RM-MEDA, named IRM-MEDA. In this paper, we also construct four additional continuous multiobjective optimization test instances. The experimental results have shown that IRM-MEDA outperforms RM-MEDA in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. In particular, IRM-MEDA performs on average 31.67% faster than RM-MEDA.

This representation is space-efficient and alleviates the need for any repair mechanisms. CNDP is a very recently proposed problem that aims to identify a vertex set V' subset of V of k &gt; 0 nodes from a given graph G = (V,E) such that G(V\\V') has minimum pairwise connectivity. Numerous practical applications for this problem exist, including pandemic disease mitigation, computer security and anti-terrorism. In order to test the proposed heuristics 16 benchmark random graph structures are additionally proposed that utilize Erdos-Renyi, Watts-Strogatz, Forest Fire and Barabasi-Albert models. Each of these models presents different network characteristics, yielding variations in problem difficulty. The relative merits of the two proposed approaches are compared and it is found that the population-based incremental learning approach, using a windowed perturbation operator is able to outperform the proposed simulated annealing method.

        "description": "With a multitude of reaction pathways, poly (ethylene-terephthalate) (PET) polymerization of industrial practice is complex, and the quality of PET is normally described in terms of several experimentally measured indices. In this paper, parameters estimation of industrial PET reactors is presented as a multi-objective problem to make the mathematic model consistent with the actual industrial process. Considering the interrelation among parameters and the failure of general optimization algorithms, a new multi-objective estimation of distribution algorithm is proposed. Kernel density estimation is used to make the new population more suitable for real-life problems instead of Gaussian model during the evolution of the algorithm. Strategies including selection of kernel width, sampling method and Pareto domination selection are used to explore and exploit the search space more efficiently. With industrial operating data identified in steady state and eliminated from gross error, kinetic parameters are estimated by minimizing carboxyl end group concentration and degree of polymerization simultaneously using the proposed algorithm. The simulation results show that the model with estimated parameters has better predictive performance compared with the experimental parameters.

Especially, we utilize the evaluation relaxation strategy (ERS) proposed herein to determine whether a candidate solution should be evaluated by actual functions or be estimated by surrogate models. BOA coupled with our entropy-based ERS, termed en-BOA, shows its superiority in significantly reducing the total number of expensive fitness evaluations until reliable convergence. Experimental results prove that the entropy-based ERS enhances the efficiency of BOA while not negatively affecting the scalability of the original algorithm.

Three local search techniques, including hill climbing, simulated annealing, and evolutionary gradient search, are considered. A novel multiobjective formulation of the multiple traveling salesman problem is proposed.

It has been shown that standard crossover operators in GAs do not guarantee an effective evolutionary search in many sophisticated problems that contain strong interactions between features. In this paper, we propose a Pittsburgh-style learning classifier system based on the Bayesian optimization algorithm with the aim of improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the rule structure exploration. In the proposed method, classifiers are generated and recombined at two levels. At the lower level, single rules contained in classifiers are produced by sampling Bayesian networks which characterize the global statistical information extracted from the current promising rules in the search space. At the higher level, classifiers are recombined by rule-wise uniform crossover operators to keep the semantics of rules in each classifier. Experimental studies on both artificial and real world binary classification problems show that the proposed method converges faster while achieving solutions with the same or even higher accuracy compared with the original Pittsburgh-style LCSs.

        "authors": "Simoncini, David Berenger, Francois Shrestha, Rojan Zhang, Kam Y. J.",
        "description": "Conformational sampling is one of the bottlenecks in fragment-based protein structure prediction approaches. They generally start with a coarse-grained optimization where mainchain atoms and centroids of side chains are considered, followed by a fine-grained optimization with an all-atom representation of proteins. It is during this coarse-grained phase that fragment-based methods sample intensely the conformational space. If the native-like region is sampled more, the accuracy of the final all-atom predictions may be improved accordingly. In this work we present EdaFold, a new method for fragment-based protein structure prediction based on an Estimation of Distribution Algorithm. Fragment-based approaches build protein models by assembling short fragments from known protein structures. Whereas the probability mass functions over the fragment libraries are uniform in the usual case, we propose an algorithm that learns from previously generated decoys and steers the search toward native-like regions. A comparison with Rosetta AbInitio protocol shows that EdaFold is able to generate models with lower energies and to enhance the percentage of near-native coarse-grained decoys on a benchmark of 20 proteins. The best coarse-grained models produced by both methods were refined into all-atom models and used in molecular replacement. All atom decoys produced out of EdaFold's decoy set reach high enough accuracy to solve the crystallographic phase problem by molecular replacement for some test proteins. EdaFold showed a higher success rate in molecular replacement when compared to Rosetta. Our study suggests that improving low resolution coarse-grained decoys allows computational methods to avoid subsequent sampling issues during all-atom refinement and to produce better all-atom models.

The proposed algorithm, in each iteration, applies a new filter strategy and a local search method to update the local best solution and, based on the local best solution, generates pheromone trails (a probability model) using a new pheromone-generating rule and applies a solution construction method of ACS to generate members for the next iteration. In addition, a new jump strategy is developed to help the search escape if the search becomes trapped at a local optimum.

        "description": "This paper presents studies on the design of Thermal Power Monitoring System (TPMS) for the forthcoming 700 MWe Indian Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor (PHWR). This reactor contains total 392 horizontal fuel channels. Each channel contains clustered natural Uranium fuel along with associated heavy water coolant placed inside a pressure tube. The coolant in different fuel channels is physically and thermally isolated from each other inside the core. It is necessary to select 44 fuel channels (out of 392) for keeping instrumentation to measure flow and temperature of coolant. The reactor is logically divided into 7 radial zones each containing certain number of fuel channels. The selection of instrumented channels is to be made such that power measured by them in terms of per unit basis represents the true zone-wise and global powers fairly accurately. This should be possible for a large number of reactor configurations that can occur because of the movement of reactivity devices in the core. Such a study is useful to make the TPMS more accurate means to measure the reactor bulk power and zone powers. The choice of 44 channels is an optimization problem in which the error in zonal and global power prediction is to be minimized. There are several constraints on the selection of instrumented channels. Therefore, a constrained combinatorial optimization problem has to be solved. An evolutionary technique based on Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) is used for this purpose. A suitable pattern of 44 instrumented channels is obtained for which errors in zonal and global powers are less than 0.5% and 2.0% respectively. The equilibrium state of the core with 357 possible device configurations is considered for the optimization. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

At the initialization stage, multiple strategies are utilized in a combination way to generate the initial solutions. At the global exploration phase, a probability model is built with the superior population to generate the new individuals and a mechanism is proposed to update the probability model. At the local exploitation phase, different operators are well designed for the two sub-populations to generate neighbor individuals and a local search strategy based on critical path is proposed to enhance the exploitation ability. In addition, the influence of parameters is investigated based on Taguchi method of design of experiment, and a suitable parameter setting is determined.

This paper considers an n-job m-machine lot-streaming flow shop scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setup times under both the idling and no-idling production cases. The objective is to minimize the maximum completion time or makespan. To solve this important practical problem, a novel estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) is proposed with a job permutation based representation. In the proposed EDA, an efficient initialization scheme based on the NEH heuristic is presented to construct an initial population with a certain level of quality and diversity. An estimation of a probabilistic model is constructed to direct the algorithm search towards good solutions by taking into account both job permutation and similar blocks of jobs. A simple but effective local search is added to enhance the intensification capability. A diversity controlling mechanism is applied to maintain the diversity of the population. In addition, a speed-up method is presented to reduce the computational effort needed for the local search technique and the NEH-based heuristics. A comparative evaluation is carried out with the best performing algorithms from the literature. The results show that the proposed EDA is very effective in comparison after comprehensive computational and statistical analyses. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

An emerging issue is that a large number of PHEVs simultaneously connected to the grid may pose a huge threat to the overall power system quality and stability. In this paper, the authors propose an algorithm for optimally managing a large number of PHEVs (e.g., 3000) charging at a municipal parking station.

A mathematical framework for the objective function (i.e., maximizing the average state-of-charge at the next time step) is also given. The authors considered real-world constraints such as energy price, remaining battery capacity, and remaining charging time. The authors also simulated the real-world parking deck scenarios according to the statistical analysis based on the transportation data.

Also, the whole space was exploited by the other population which exchanges information with the sub-populations. In order to make the evolutionary course efficient, multivariate Gaussian model and Gaussian mixture model were used in both populations separately to estimate the distribution of individuals and reproduce new generations. For the surrogate model, Gaussian process was combined with the algorithm which predicted variance of the predictions.

The EDA is a predominant all-round optimizing method in the macroscopic simulation of evolution process species of nature. Recent studies have shown that the EDA provides better solution for nonlinear problems than the microscopic evolutionary algorithm, such as genetic algorithm (GA) in some cases. The EDA is simpler, both computationally and theoretically, than the GA. We discuss how this can be used to calculate the permittivity and conductivity of the targets.

Each of the algorithms performs well in certain cases and none of them are dominating one another. This study is based on the idea of synthesizing different evolutionary algorithms so as to complement the limitations of each algorithm. On top of this idea, this paper proposes an adaptive mechanism that synthesizes a genetic algorithm, differential evolution and estimation of distribution algorithm. The adaptive mechanism takes into account the ratio of the number of promising solutions generated from each optimizer in an early stage of evolutions so as to determine the proportion of the number of solutions to be produced by each optimizer in the next generation. Furthermore, the adaptive algorithm is also hybridized with the evolutionary gradient search to further enhance its search ability. The proposed hybrid adaptive algorithm is developed in the domination-based and decomposition-based multi-objective frameworks. An extensive experimental study is carried out to test the performances of the proposed algorithms in 38 state-of-the-art benchmark test instances.",

Particularly, the class of clustering algorithms based on the idea of data density to identify clusters has many advantages, such as the ability to identify arbitrary-shape clusters. We propose the use of Estimation of Distribution Algorithms for the artificial generation of density-based clustering algorithms.

The candidate policies use an index for ranking the arms and pick at each play the arm with the highest index; the index for each arm is computed in the form of a linear combination of features describing the history of plays (e.g., number of draws, average reward, variance of rewards and higher order moments), and an estimation of distribution algorithm is used to determine its optimal parameters in the form of feature weights. We carry out simulations in the case where the prior assumes a fixed number of Bernoulli arms, a fixed horizon, and uniformly distributed parameters of the Bernoulli arms. These simulations show that learned strategies perform very well with respect to several other strategies previously proposed in the literature (UCB1, UCB2, UCB-V, KL-UCB and epsilon(n)-GREEDY); they also highlight the robustness of these strategies with respect to wrong prior information",

As the probabilistic model of the EDA-RL, the Conditional Random Fields proposed by Lafferty et al. are employed. The Conditional Random Fields can estimate conditional probability distributions by using Markov Network. Moreover, the structural search of probabilistic model by using x(2)-test, and data correction method are examined. One of the primary features of the EDA-RL is the direct estimation of reinforcement learning agents' policies by using the Conditional Random Fields. Another feature is that a kind of undirected graphical probabilistic model is used in the proposed method. The experimental results on Probabilistic Transition Problems and Maze Problems show the effectiveness of the EDA-RL.",

        "description": "A novel graph-based Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) named Probabilistic Model Building Genetic Network Programming (PMBGNP) has been proposed. Inspired by classical EDAs, PMBGNP memorizes the current best individuals and uses them to estimate a distribution for the generation of the new population. However, PMBGNP can evolve compact programs by representing its solutions as graph structures. Therefore, it can solve a range of problems different from conventional ones in EDA literature, such as data mining and Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems. This paper extends PMBGNP from discrete to continuous search space, which is named PMBGNP-AC. Besides evolving the node connections to determine the optimal graph structures using conventional PMBGNP, Gaussian distribution is used for the distribution of continuous variables of nodes. The mean value mu and standard deviation sigma are constructed like those of classical continuous Population-based incremental learning (PBILc). However, a RL technique, i.e., Actor-Critic (AC), is designed to update the parameters (mu and sigma). AC allows us to calculate the Temporal-Difference (TD) error to evaluate whether the selection of the continuous value is better or worse than expected. This scalar reinforcement signal can decide whether the tendency to select this continuous value should be strengthened or weakened, allowing us to determine the shape of the probability density functions of the Gaussian distribution. The proposed algorithm is applied to a RL problem, i.e., autonomous robot control, where the robot's wheel speeds and sensor values are continuous. The experimental results show the superiority of PMBGNP-AC comparing with the conventional algorithms.",

Four types of digital infinite impulse response (IIR) filters are designed by using mEDA and the results show that mEDA can obtain better filter performance than four state-of-the-art methods.",

In 'resampling continuous EDAs', a population of densities of the selected promising solutions is obtained by iteratively using the resampling operator and the density estimation operator, and new candidate solutions at the next generation are reproduced through sampling from all obtained densities of promising solutions. In 'subspaces continuous EDAs', a population of densities is obtained by randomly choosing a subset of all variables and estimating the density of all selected high-quality solutions in this subspace. The above steps iterate and many densities of high-quality solutions in different subspaces can be obtained. New candidate solutions at the next generation are reproduced through perturbing the old promising solutions by sampling from the densities in different subspaces. The results upon convergence with different numbers of variables and the effects of parameters on the performance of the density ensembles methods for continuous EDAs are studied based on the experimental results.",

        "description": "Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) focus on explicitly modelling dependencies between solution variables. A Gaussian distribution over continuous variables is commonly used, with several different covariance matrix structures ranging from diagonal i.e. Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm (UMDA(c)) to full i.e. Estimation of Multivariate Normal density Algorithm (EMNA). A diagonal covariance model is simple but is unable to directly represent covariances between problem variables. On the other hand, a full covariance model requires estimation of (more) parameters from the selected population. In practice, numerical issues can arise with this estimation problem. In addition, the performance of the model has been shown to be sometimes undesirable. In this paper, a modified Gaussian-based continuous EDA is proposed, called sEDA, that provides a mechanism to control the amount of covariance parameters estimated within the Gaussian model. To achieve this, a simple variable screening technique from experimental design is adapted and combined with an idea inspired by the Pareto-front in multi-objective optimization. Compared to EMNA(global), the algorithm provides improved numerical stability and can use a smaller selected population. Experimental results are presented to evaluate and compare the performance of the algorithm to UMDA(c) and EMNA(global)",

The model refers to returns, prices and transaction volumes of stocks that are listed on the Colombian Stock Exchange (BVC), and particularly to time series that represent the returns of the stocks of Ecopetrol. The proposed model uses the estimation of distribution algorithms (EDA's) for the short-term projection of the returns of such stocks. The EDAs, unlike other optimization techniques that are based on traditional evolution algorithms, provide greater statistical robustness in shaping the population of individuals and with respect to the number of generations that are required to solve the problem. For this purpose the EDA incorporates three dynamic populations that explore the solution space of the problem by using a mechanism which propagates the differences that exist among the best individuals. Additionally, it includes a strategy to preserve the diversity of the population. The proposed model allowed short-term projections for the future values of the returns of Ecopetrol stocks, departing from a set of parameters and variables that make up the stock price. This way the behavior of a specific asset can be described over time and the complexity which is associated with the application of traditional techniques, that allow the modeling of financial time series, can be eliminated.",

In order to solve the copula selection problem, an innovative and general method, called switched copula method is introduced, which can ignore how to determine a fixed copula beforehand, and evolve the copula selection process dynamically by organizing different kinds of copulas through a copula selection pool. The proposed algorithm is easy to implement and provides a balance between accuracy and efficiency of the copula selection, in the meantime it can be applied to the coverage problem conveniently.

Estimating larger subset distributions is more prone to sample noise, so the larger distribution can be estimated from the smaller ones with the Maximum Entropy method.

We apply this methodology to investigate the specific issue of explicit dependency modeling in simple continuous estimation of distribution algorithms. Experimental results reveal specific examples of landscapes (with certain identifiable features) where dependency modeling is useful, harmful, or has little impact on mean algorithm performance. Heat maps are used to compare algorithm performance over a large number of landscape instances and algorithm trials. Finally, we perform a meta-search in the landscape parameter space to find landscapes which maximize the performance between algorithms. The results are related to some previous intuition about the behavior of these algorithms, but at the same time lead to new insights into the relationship between dependency modeling in EDAs and the structure of the problem landscape. The landscape generator and overall methodology are quite general and extendable and can be used to examine specific features of other algorithms.",

Most EDAs explicitly use the probabilistic model to sample new solutions without using traditional genetic operators. EDAs make good use of the global statistical information collected from previous searches but they do not efficiently use the location information about individual solutions. It is recently realized that global statistical information and location information should complement each other during the evolution process. In view of this, we design the Self-guided GA based on a novel strategy to combine these two kinds of information. The Self-guided GA does not sample new solutions from the probabilistic model. Instead, it estimates the quality of a candidate offspring based on the probabilistic model used in its crossover and mutation operations. In such a way, the mutation and crossover operations are able to generate fitter solutions, thus improving the performance of the algorithm. We tested the proposed algorithm by applying it to deal with the NP-complete flowshop scheduling problem to minimize the makespan. The experimental results show that the Self-guided GA is very promising. We also demonstrate that the Self-guided GA can be easily extended to treat other intractable combinatorial problems.

While the focus of the paper is on additively decomposable problems and the hierarchical Bayesian optimization algorithm, it should be straightforward to generalize the approach to other model-directed optimization techniques and other problem classes.

While the primary goal of applying EDAs is to discover the global optimum or at least its accurate approximation, besides this, any EDA provides us with a sequence of probabilistic models, which in most cases hold a great deal of information about the problem. Although using problem-specific knowledge has been shown to significantly improve performance of EDAs and other evolutionary algorithms, this readily available source of problem-specific information has been practically ignored by the EDA community. This paper takes the first step toward the use of probabilistic models obtained by EDAs to speed up the solution of similar problems in the future. More specifically, we propose two approaches to biasing model building in the hierarchical Bayesian optimization algorithm (hBOA) based on knowledge automatically learned from previous hBOA runs on similar problems. We show that the proposed methods lead to substantial speedups and argue that the methods should work well in other applications that require solving a large number of problems with similar structure.",

To exhibit the utility of the EPSDA framework, an extended compact particle swarm optimization (EcPSO) is developed by combining the strengths of the extended compact genetic algorithm (EcGA) with binary PSO (BPSO), along the lines of the suggested framework. Due to its effective nature of harmonizing the global search of EcGA with the local search of BPSO, EcPSO is able to discover the optimal solution in a fast and reliable manner.

        "description": "Estimation-of-Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) build and use probabilistic models during optimization in order to automatically discover and use an optimization problems' structure. This is especially useful for black-box optimization where no assumptions are made on the problem being solved, which is characteristic of many cases in solving complex real-world problems. In this paper we consider multi-objective optimization problems with real-valued variables. Although the vast majority of advances in EDA literature concern single-objective optimization, advances have also been made in multi-objective optimization. In this paper we bring together two recent advances, namely incremental Gaussian model building to reduce the required population size and a mixture-based multi-objective framework that has specific methods to better facilitate model-building techniques that span multiple generations. Significantly faster convergence to the optimal Pareto front is achieved on 6 out of 7 artificial benchmark problems from literature. Although results on two of these problems show that building models with higher-order interactions between variables is required, these problems are still artificial. We therefore also consider a more realistic optimization problem in image processing, namely deformable image registration. For this problem too, our results show the need for processing interactions between problem variables, stressing the importance of studying the use of such models. Furthermore, the number of problem variables in the deformable image registration problem can be very large. The building of models with higher-order interactions, especially mixture-based models, then requires very large population sizes. The use of incremental model building is therefore of high importance. This claim is supported by our results that show a huge reduction in the number of required evaluations on this problem.",

        "description": "The successful application of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) to solve different kinds of problems has reinforced their candidature as promising black-box optimization tools. However, their internal behavior is still not completely understood and therefore it is necessary to work in this direction in order to advance their development. This paper presents a methodology of analysis which provides new information about the behavior of EDAs by quantitatively analyzing the probabilistic models learned during the search. We particularly focus on calculating the probabilities of the optimal solutions, the most probable solution given by the model and the best individual of the population at each step of the algorithm. We carry out the analysis by optimizing functions of different nature such as Trap5, two variants of Ising spin glass and Max-SAT. By using different structures in the probabilistic models, we also analyze the impact of the structural model accuracy in the quantitative behavior of EDAs. In addition, the objective function values of our analyzed key solutions are contrasted with their probability values in order to study the connection between function and probabilistic models. The results not only show information about the internal behavior of EDAs, but also about the quality of the optimization process and setup of the parameters, the relationship between the probabilistic model and the fitness function, and even about the problem itself. Furthermore, the results allow us to discover common patterns of behavior in EDAs and propose new ideas in the development of this type of algorithms.",

        "description": "Many data mining algorithms can only deal with discrete data or have a better performance on discrete data; however, for some technological reasons often we can only obtain the continuous value in the real world. Therefore, discretization has played an important role in data mining. Discretization is defined as the process of mapping the continuous attribute space into the discrete space, namely, using integer values or symbols to represent the continuous spaces. In this paper, we proposed a discretization method on the basis of a Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm (UMDA). The UMDA is a combination of statistics learning theory and Evolution Algorithms. The fitness function of the UMDA not only took the accuracy of the classifier into account, but also the number of breakpoints. Experimental results showed that the algorithm proposed in this paper could effectively reduce the number of breakpoints, and at the same time, improve the accuracy of the classifier.

Some practical systems, such as the large power system, usually exhibits the characters of multiple time scale and interconnections among subsystems. Thus, the interconnected fuzzy singular perturbed model is proposed to model such industrial system. Additionally, the fuzzy singular perturbed model with multiple perturbation parameters can describe a nonlinear multiple time scale system more precisely than the one with a single perturbation param- eter. However, the concentrated control of interconnected fuzzy singular perturbed model can not achieve excellent performance due to the interconnection term. Sometimes the interconnection term, which can be regarded as the external disturbance, may even lead to divergence in the control system.

In EDAs, a model is learned from the selected population that encodes interactions among problem variables. New individuals are generated by sampling the model and incorporated into the population. Different probabilistic models have been used in EDAs to learn interactions. Bayesian network (BN) is a well-known graphical model which is used in BOA. Learning a proper model in EDAs and particularly in BOA is distinguished as a computationally expensive task. Different methods have been proposed in the literature to improve the complexity of model building in EDAs. This paper employs bivariate dependencies to learn accurate BNs in BOA efficiently. The proposed approach extracts the bivariate dependencies using an appropriate pairwise interaction-detection metric. Due to the static structure of the underlying problems, these dependencies are used in each generation of BOA to learn an accurate network. By using this approach, the computational cost of model building is reduced dramatically. Various optimization problems are selected to be solved by the algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed approach successfully finds the optimum in problems with different, types of interactions efficiently. Significant speedups are observed in the model building procedure as well.",

In a typical uncertainty-quantification study, reservoir models must be updated using the observed response from the reservoir by a process known as history matching. This involves solving an inverse problem, finding reservoir models that produce, under simulation, a similar response to that of the real reservoir. However, this requires multiple expensive multiphase-flow simulations. Thus, uncertainty-quantification studies employ optimization techniques to find acceptable models to be used in prediction. Different optimization algorithms and search strategies are presented in the literature, but they are generally unsatisfactory because of slow convergence to the optimal regions of the global search space, and, more importantly, failure in finding multiple acceptable reservoir models. In this context, a new approach is offered by estimation-of-distribution algorithms (EDAs). EDAs are population-based algorithms that use models to estimate the probability distribution of promising solutions and then generate new candidate solutions.|This paper explores the application of EDAs, including univariate and multivariate models. We discuss two histogram-based univariate models and one multivariate model, the Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA), which employs Bayesian networks for modeling. By considering possible interactions between variables and exploiting explicitly stored knowledge of such interactions, EDAs can accelerate the search process while preserving search diversity. Unlike most existing approaches applied to uncertainty quantification, the Bayesian network allows the BOA to build solutions using flexible rules learned from the models obtained, rather than fixed rules, leading to better solutions and improved convergence. The BOA is naturally suited to finding good solutions in complex high-dimensional spaces, such as those typical in reservoir-uncertainty quantification.|We demonstrate the effectiveness of EDA by applying the well-known synthetic PUNQ-S3 case with multiple wells. This allows us to verify the methodology in a well-controlled case. Results show better estimation of uncertainty when compared with some other traditional population-based algorithms.",

The above steps iterate and many densities of high-quality solutions in different subspaces can be obtained.

A Gaussian distribution over continuous variables is commonly used, with several different covariance matrix structures ranging from diagonal i.e. Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm (UMDA(c)) to full i.e. Estimation of Multivariate Normal density Algorithm (EMNA). A diagonal covariance model is simple but is unable to directly represent covariances between problem variables. On the other hand, a full covariance model requires estimation of (more) parameters from the selected population. In practice, numerical issues can arise with this estimation problem. In addition, the performance of the model has been shown to be sometimes undesirable. In this paper, a modified Gaussian-based continuous EDA is proposed, called sEDA, that provides a mechanism to control the amount of covariance parameters estimated within the Gaussian model. To achieve this, a simple variable screening technique from experimental design is adapted and combined with an idea inspired by the Pareto-front in multi-objective optimization. Compared to EMNA(global), the algorithm provides improved numerical stability and can use a smaller selected population. Experimental results are presented to evaluate and compare the performance of the algorithm to UMDA(c) and EMNA(global)",

        "description": "In this paper a model, which is based on the principles of evolutionary computation, will be developed and analyzed for financial forecasting and time series prediction. The model refers to returns, prices and transaction volumes of stocks that are listed on the Colombian Stock Exchange (BVC), and particularly to time series that represent the returns of the stocks of Ecopetrol. The proposed model uses the estimation of distribution algorithms (EDA's) for the short-term projection of the returns of such stocks. The EDAs, unlike other optimization techniques that are based on traditional evolution algorithms, provide greater statistical robustness in shaping the population of individuals and with respect to the number of generations that are required to solve the problem. For this purpose the EDA incorporates three dynamic populations that explore the solution space of the problem by using a mechanism which propagates the differences that exist among the best individuals. Additionally, it includes a strategy to preserve the diversity of the population. The proposed model allowed short-term projections for the future values of the returns of Ecopetrol stocks, departing from a set of parameters and variables that make up the stock price. This way the behavior of a specific asset can be described over time and the complexity which is associated with the application of traditional techniques, that allow the modeling of financial time series, can be eliminated.",

MN-GIBBS uses a Markov network easily derived from the ADF and Gibbs sampling. We discuss different variants of Gibbs sampling.

Although applying copula theory to EDAs is a rising and promising research issue, how to choose the right copula becomes a hurdle to the research of copula-based EDAs. In order to solve the copula selection problem, an innovative and general method, called switched copula method is introduced, which can ignore how to determine a fixed copula beforehand, and evolve the copula selection process dynamically by organizing different kinds of copulas through a copula selection pool. The proposed algorithm is easy to implement and provides a balance between accuracy and efficiency of the copula selection, in the meantime it can be applied to the coverage problem conveniently.

Estimating larger subset distributions is more prone to sample noise, so the larger distribution can be estimated from the smaller ones with the Maximum Entropy method.

This paper presents a Markov Network based EDA that is based on the use of the local Markov property, the Markovianity, and does not directly model the joint distribution. We call it Markovianity based Optimisation Algorithm. The algorithm combines a novel method for extracting the neighbourhood structure from the mutual information between the variables, with a Gibbs sampler method to generate new points. We present an extensive empirical validation of the algorithm on problems with complex interactions, comparing its performance with other EDAs that use higher order interactions. We extend the analysis to other functions with discrete representation, where EDA results are scarce, comparing the algorithm with state of the art EDAs that use marginal product factorisations.",

We apply this methodology to investigate the specific issue of explicit dependency modeling in simple continuous estimation of distribution algorithms. Experimental results reveal specific examples of landscapes (with certain identifiable features) where dependency modeling is useful, harmful, or has little impact on mean algorithm performance. Heat maps are used to compare algorithm performance over a large number of landscape instances and algorithm trials. Finally, we perform a meta-search in the landscape parameter space to find landscapes which maximize the performance between algorithms. The results are related to some previous intuition about the behavior of these algorithms, but at the same time lead to new insights into the relationship between dependency modeling in EDAs and the structure of the problem landscape. The landscape generator and overall methodology are quite general and extendable and can be used to examine specific features of other algorithms.",

This proposed algorithm is named extended artificial chromosomes with genetic algorithm (eACGA). We investigate the usefulness of the probabilistic models and to compare eACGA with several famous permutation-oriented EDAs on the benchmark instances of the permutation flowshop scheduling problems (PFSPs). eACGA yields better solution quality for makespan criterion when we use the average error ratio metric as their performance measures.

Most EDAs explicitly use the probabilistic model to sample new solutions without using traditional genetic operators. EDAs make good use of the global statistical information collected from previous searches but they do not efficiently use the location information about individual solutions. It is recently realized that global statistical information and location information should complement each other during the evolution process. In view of this, we design the Self-guided GA based on a novel strategy to combine these two kinds of information. The Self-guided GA does not sample new solutions from the probabilistic model. Instead, it estimates the quality of a candidate offspring based on the probabilistic model used in its crossover and mutation operations. In such a way, the mutation and crossover operations are able to generate fitter solutions, thus improving the performance of the algorithm. We tested the proposed algorithm by applying it to deal with the NP-complete flowshop scheduling problem to minimize the makespan. The experimental results show that the Self-guided GA is very promising. We also demonstrate that the Self-guided GA can be easily extended to treat other intractable combinatorial problems.

The purpose of this paper is to describe a method that combines such a problem-specific distance metric with information mined from probabilistic models obtained in previous runs of estimation of distribution algorithms with the goal of solving future problem instances of similar type with increased speed, accuracy and reliability. While the focus of the paper is on additively decomposable problems and the hierarchical Bayesian optimization algorithm, it should be straightforward to generalize the approach to other model-directed optimization techniques and other problem classes.

While the primary goal of applying EDAs is to discover the global optimum or at least its accurate approximation, besides this, any EDA provides us with a sequence of probabilistic models, which in most cases hold a great deal of information about the problem. Although using problem-specific knowledge has been shown to significantly improve performance of EDAs and other evolutionary algorithms, this readily available source of problem-specific information has been practically ignored by the EDA community. This paper takes the first step toward the use of probabilistic models obtained by EDAs to speed up the solution of similar problems in the future. More specifically, we propose two approaches to biasing model building in the hierarchical Bayesian optimization algorithm (hBOA) based on knowledge automatically learned from previous hBOA runs on similar problems. We show that the proposed methods lead to substantial speedups and argue that the methods should work well in other applications that require solving a large number of problems with similar structure.",

This is especially useful for black-box optimization where no assumptions are made on the problem being solved, which is characteristic of many cases in solving complex real-world problems. In this paper we consider multi-objective optimization problems with real-valued variables. Although the vast majority of advances in EDA literature concern single-objective optimization, advances have also been made in multi-objective optimization. In this paper we bring together two recent advances, namely incremental Gaussian model building to reduce the required population size and a mixture-based multi-objective framework that has specific methods to better facilitate model-building techniques that span multiple generations. Significantly faster convergence to the optimal Pareto front is achieved on 6 out of 7 artificial benchmark problems from literature. Although results on two of these problems show that building models with higher-order interactions between variables is required, these problems are still artificial. We therefore also consider a more realistic optimization problem in image processing, namely deformable image registration. For this problem too, our results show the need for processing interactions between problem variables, stressing the importance of studying the use of such models. Furthermore, the number of problem variables in the deformable image registration problem can be very large. The building of models with higher-order interactions, especially mixture-based models, then requires very large population sizes. The use of incremental model building is therefore of high importance. This claim is supported by our results that show a huge reduction in the number of required evaluations on this problem.",

However, their internal behavior is still not completely understood and therefore it is necessary to work in this direction in order to advance their development. This paper presents a methodology of analysis which provides new information about the behavior of EDAs by quantitatively analyzing the probabilistic models learned during the search. We particularly focus on calculating the probabilities of the optimal solutions, the most probable solution given by the model and the best individual of the population at each step of the algorithm. We carry out the analysis by optimizing functions of different nature such as Trap5, two variants of Ising spin glass and Max-SAT. By using different structures in the probabilistic models, we also analyze the impact of the structural model accuracy in the quantitative behavior of EDAs. In addition, the objective function values of our analyzed key solutions are contrasted with their probability values in order to study the connection between function and probabilistic models. The results not only show information about the internal behavior of EDAs, but also about the quality of the optimization process and setup of the parameters, the relationship between the probabilistic model and the fitness function, and even about the problem itself. Furthermore, the results allow us to discover common patterns of behavior in EDAs and propose new ideas in the development of this type of algorithms.",

The use of diverse sub-swarms increases performance when optimizing multi-modal functions. However, new design decisions arise when implementing multi-swarm systems such as how to select the initial positions and initial velocities, and how to coordinate the different sub-swarms. Starting from the relatively simple multi-swarm system of locust swarms, ideas from differential evolution and estimation of distribution algorithms are used to address the new design considerations that are specific to multi-swarm systems. Experiments show that the new hybrid system can perform better than each of the individual components.",

In the second step a new population is generated by a new cliqued Gibbs sampler (CG-Sampler) that drags through the space of solutions driven by the cliques of the learned graphical Markov model. Two variants of this algorithm are compared, the Adaptive Tree Cliqued - EDA (ATC-EDA) and the Adaptive Extended Tree Cliqued - EDA (AETC-EDA), and the Boltzmann selection procedure is used in CG-Sampler.

Some practical systems, such as the large power system, usually exhibits the characters of multiple time scale and interconnections among subsystems. Thus, the interconnected fuzzy singular perturbed model is proposed to model such industrial system. Additionally, the fuzzy singular perturbed model with multiple perturbation parameters can describe a nonlinear multiple time scale system more precisely than the one with a single perturbation param- eter. However, the concentrated control of interconnected fuzzy singular perturbed model can not achieve excellent performance due to the interconnection term. Sometimes the interconnection term, which can be regarded as the external disturbance, may even lead to divergence in the control system. Thus, in this paper, the decentralized multi-objective robust controller is proposed. On one hand, the control of the fuzzy singular perturbed model can achieve good results under the condition of cross-linking among the subsystems by using the decentralized controller. On the other hand, a multi-extreme optimization model is established considering the noise resistance level, dynamical performance and the control input amplitude comprehensively. The method of Estimation of Distribution Algorithms is utilized to solve this optimization model.

In EDAs, a model is learned from the selected population that encodes interactions among problem variables. New individuals are generated by sampling the model and incorporated into the population. Different probabilistic models have been used in EDAs to learn interactions. Bayesian network (BN) is a well-known graphical model which is used in BOA. Learning a proper model in EDAs and particularly in BOA is distinguished as a computationally expensive task. Different methods have been proposed in the literature to improve the complexity of model building in EDAs. This paper employs bivariate dependencies to learn accurate BNs in BOA efficiently. The proposed approach extracts the bivariate dependencies using an appropriate pairwise interaction-detection metric. Due to the static structure of the underlying problems, these dependencies are used in each generation of BOA to learn an accurate network. By using this approach, the computational cost of model building is reduced dramatically. Various optimization problems are selected to be solved by the algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed approach successfully finds the optimum in problems with different, types of interactions efficiently. Significant speedups are observed in the model building procedure as well.",

In a typical uncertainty-quantification study, reservoir models must be updated using the observed response from the reservoir by a process known as history matching. This involves solving an inverse problem, finding reservoir models that produce, under simulation, a similar response to that of the real reservoir. However, this requires multiple expensive multiphase-flow simulations. Thus, uncertainty-quantification studies employ optimization techniques to find acceptable models to be used in prediction. Different optimization algorithms and search strategies are presented in the literature, but they are generally unsatisfactory because of slow convergence to the optimal regions of the global search space, and, more importantly, failure in finding multiple acceptable reservoir models. In this context, a new approach is offered by estimation-of-distribution algorithms (EDAs). EDAs are population-based algorithms that use models to estimate the probability distribution of promising solutions and then generate new candidate solutions.|This paper explores the application of EDAs, including univariate and multivariate models. We discuss two histogram-based univariate models and one multivariate model, the Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA), which employs Bayesian networks for modeling. By considering possible interactions between variables and exploiting explicitly stored knowledge of such interactions, EDAs can accelerate the search process while preserving search diversity. Unlike most existing approaches applied to uncertainty quantification, the Bayesian network allows the BOA to build solutions using flexible rules learned from the models obtained, rather than fixed rules, leading to better solutions and improved convergence. The BOA is naturally suited to finding good solutions in complex high-dimensional spaces, such as those typical in reservoir-uncertainty quantification.|We demonstrate the effectiveness of EDA by applying the well-known synthetic PUNQ-S3 case with multiple wells.

A Gaussian distribution over continuous variables is commonly used, with several different covariance matrix structures ranging from diagonal i.e. Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm (UMDA(c)) to full i.e. Estimation of Multivariate Normal density Algorithm (EMNA). A diagonal covariance model is simple but is unable to directly represent covariances between problem variables. On the other hand, a full covariance model requires estimation of (more) parameters from the selected population. In practice, numerical issues can arise with this estimation problem. In addition, the performance of the model has been shown to be sometimes undesirable. In this paper, a modified Gaussian-based continuous EDA is proposed, called sEDA, that provides a mechanism to control the amount of covariance parameters estimated within the Gaussian model. To achieve this, a simple variable screening technique from experimental design is adapted and combined with an idea inspired by the Pareto-front in multi-objective optimization. Compared to EMNA(global), the algorithm provides improved numerical stability and can use a smaller selected population. Experimental results are presented to evaluate and compare the performance of the algorithm to UMDA(c) and EMNA(global)",

The proposed model uses the estimation of distribution algorithms (EDA's) for the short-term projection of the returns of such stocks. The EDAs, unlike other optimization techniques that are based on traditional evolution algorithms, provide greater statistical robustness in shaping the population of individuals and with respect to the number of generations that are required to solve the problem. For this purpose the EDA incorporates three dynamic populations that explore the solution space of the problem by using a mechanism which propagates the differences that exist among the best individuals. Additionally, it includes a strategy to preserve the diversity of the population. The proposed model allowed short-term projections for the future values of the returns of Ecopetrol stocks, departing from a set of parameters and variables that make up the stock price.

        "description": "One fundamental issue in wireless sensor network is the coverage problem, which reflects how well a sensor network is monitored or tracked by sensors. In this paper, a new copula-based estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), Scopula-EDAs, is introduced to solve this problem. Although applying copula theory to EDAs is a rising and promising research issue, how to choose the right copula becomes a hurdle to the research of copula-based EDAs. In order to solve the copula selection problem, an innovative and general method, called switched copula method is introduced, which can ignore how to determine a fixed copula beforehand, and evolve the copula selection process dynamically by organizing different kinds of copulas through a copula selection pool. The proposed algorithm is easy to implement and provides a balance between accuracy and efficiency of the copula selection, in the meantime it can be applied to the coverage problem conveniently. The experiment results validate the feasibility and efficiency of our algorithm.",

Estimating larger subset distributions is more prone to sample noise, so the larger distribution can be estimated from the smaller ones with the Maximum Entropy method. Building an exact graphical model for sampling is often infeasible. E.g. in a 2-D grid the triangulated Markov network has linear clique size, thus exponentially large distributions.

This paper presents a Markov Network based EDA that is based on the use of the local Markov property, the Markovianity, and does not directly model the joint distribution. We call it Markovianity based Optimisation Algorithm. The algorithm combines a novel method for extracting the neighbourhood structure from the mutual information between the variables, with a Gibbs sampler method to generate new points. We present an extensive empirical validation of the algorithm on problems with complex interactions, comparing its performance with other EDAs that use higher order interactions.

We apply this methodology to investigate the specific issue of explicit dependency modeling in simple continuous estimation of distribution algorithms. Experimental results reveal specific examples of landscapes (with certain identifiable features) where dependency modeling is useful, harmful, or has little impact on mean algorithm performance. Heat maps are used to compare algorithm performance over a large number of landscape instances and algorithm trials. Finally, we perform a meta-search in the landscape parameter space to find landscapes which maximize the performance between algorithms. The results are related to some previous intuition about the behavior of these algorithms, but at the same time lead to new insights into the relationship between dependency modeling in EDAs and the structure of the problem landscape. The landscape generator and overall methodology are quite general and extendable and can be used to examine specific features of other algorithms.",

In this paper, a new probabilistic model is proposed to capture the variable linkages together with the univariate probabilistic model where most EDAs could use only one statistic information. This proposed algorithm is named extended artificial chromosomes with genetic algorithm (eACGA). We investigate the usefulness of the probabilistic models and to compare eACGA with several famous permutation-oriented EDAs on the benchmark instances of the permutation flowshop scheduling problems (PFSPs). eACGA yields better solution quality for makespan criterion when we use the average error ratio metric as their performance measures. In addition, eACGA is further integrated with well-known heuristic algorithms, such as NEH and variable neighborhood search (VNS) and it is denoted as eACGA(hybrid) to solve the considered problems. No matter the solution quality and the computation efficiency, the experimental results indicate that eACGA(hybrid) outperforms other known algorithms in literature.

Most EDAs explicitly use the probabilistic model to sample new solutions without using traditional genetic operators. EDAs make good use of the global statistical information collected from previous searches but they do not efficiently use the location information about individual solutions. It is recently realized that global statistical information and location information should complement each other during the evolution process. In view of this, we design the Self-guided GA based on a novel strategy to combine these two kinds of information. The Self-guided GA does not sample new solutions from the probabilistic model. Instead, it estimates the quality of a candidate offspring based on the probabilistic model used in its crossover and mutation operations. In such a way, the mutation and crossover operations are able to generate fitter solutions, thus improving the performance of the algorithm. We tested the proposed algorithm by applying it to deal with the NP-complete flowshop scheduling problem to minimize the makespan. The experimental results show that the Self-guided GA is very promising. We also demonstrate that the Self-guided GA can be easily extended to treat other intractable combinatorial problems.

The purpose of this paper is to describe a method that combines such a problem-specific distance metric with information mined from probabilistic models obtained in previous runs of estimation of distribution algorithms with the goal of solving future problem instances of similar type with increased speed, accuracy and reliability. While the focus of the paper is on additively decomposable problems and the hierarchical Bayesian optimization algorithm, it should be straightforward to generalize the approach to other model-directed optimization techniques and other problem classes. Compared to other techniques for learning from experience put forward in the past, the proposed technique is both more practical and more broadly applicable.",

While the primary goal of applying EDAs is to discover the global optimum or at least its accurate approximation, besides this, any EDA provides us with a sequence of probabilistic models, which in most cases hold a great deal of information about the problem. Although using problem-specific knowledge has been shown to significantly improve performance of EDAs and other evolutionary algorithms, this readily available source of problem-specific information has been practically ignored by the EDA community. This paper takes the first step toward the use of probabilistic models obtained by EDAs to speed up the solution of similar problems in the future. More specifically, we propose two approaches to biasing model building in the hierarchical Bayesian optimization algorithm (hBOA) based on knowledge automatically learned from previous hBOA runs on similar problems. We show that the proposed methods lead to substantial speedups and argue that the methods should work well in other applications that require solving a large number of problems with similar structure.",

To exhibit the utility of the EPSDA framework, an extended compact particle swarm optimization (EcPSO) is developed by combining the strengths of the extended compact genetic algorithm (EcGA) with binary PSO (BPSO), along the lines of the suggested framework. Due to its effective nature of harmonizing the global search of EcGA with the local search of BPSO, EcPSO is able to discover the optimal solution in a fast and reliable manner.

This is especially useful for black-box optimization where no assumptions are made on the problem being solved, which is characteristic of many cases in solving complex real-world problems. In this paper we consider multi-objective optimization problems with real-valued variables. Although the vast majority of advances in EDA literature concern single-objective optimization, advances have also been made in multi-objective optimization. In this paper we bring together two recent advances, namely incremental Gaussian model building to reduce the required population size and a mixture-based multi-objective framework that has specific methods to better facilitate model-building techniques that span multiple generations. Significantly faster convergence to the optimal Pareto front is achieved on 6 out of 7 artificial benchmark problems from literature. Although results on two of these problems show that building models with higher-order interactions between variables is required, these problems are still artificial. We therefore also consider a more realistic optimization problem in image processing, namely deformable image registration. For this problem too, our results show the need for processing interactions between problem variables, stressing the importance of studying the use of such models. Furthermore, the number of problem variables in the deformable image registration problem can be very large. The building of models with higher-order interactions, especially mixture-based models, then requires very large population sizes. The use of incremental model building is therefore of high importance. This claim is supported by our results that show a huge reduction in the number of required evaluations on this problem.",

However, their internal behavior is still not completely understood and therefore it is necessary to work in this direction in order to advance their development. This paper presents a methodology of analysis which provides new information about the behavior of EDAs by quantitatively analyzing the probabilistic models learned during the search. We particularly focus on calculating the probabilities of the optimal solutions, the most probable solution given by the model and the best individual of the population at each step of the algorithm. We carry out the analysis by optimizing functions of different nature such as Trap5, two variants of Ising spin glass and Max-SAT. By using different structures in the probabilistic models, we also analyze the impact of the structural model accuracy in the quantitative behavior of EDAs. In addition, the objective function values of our analyzed key solutions are contrasted with their probability values in order to study the connection between function and probabilistic models. The results not only show information about the internal behavior of EDAs, but also about the quality of the optimization process and setup of the parameters, the relationship between the probabilistic model and the fitness function, and even about the problem itself. Furthermore, the results allow us to discover common patterns of behavior in EDAs and propose new ideas in the development of this type of algorithms.",

We propose a framework for transfer learning between related optimization problems by means of structural transfer. Different methods for incrementing or replacing the (possibly unavailable) structural information of the target optimization problem are presented. As a test case we solve the multi-marker tagging single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) selection problem, a real world problem from genetics. The introduced variants of structural transfer are validated in the computation of tagging SNPs on a database of 1167 individuals from 58 human populations worldwide. Our experimental results show significant improvements over EDAs that do not incorporate information from related problems.",

The unified hiberarchy model and formalization description for swarm intelligence are represented.

In this chapter, we re-visit the fundamental question of \"what is an Evolutionary Algorithm?\" not only from the traditional viewpoint but also the wider, more modern perspectives relating it to other areas of Evolutionary Computation. To do so, apart from discussing the main characteristics of this family of algorithms we also look at Memetic Algorithms and the Swarm Intelligence algorithms.

The searching sample algorithm learns a tree, and then, uses a sample complexity index to prognose the missing edges to obtain the cliques of the structure of the estimating distribution adding more edges if necessary. In the second step a new population is generated by a new cliqued Gibbs sampler (CG-Sampler) that drags through the space of solutions driven by the cliques of the learned graphical Markov model. Two variants of this algorithm are compared, the Adaptive Tree Cliqued - EDA (ATC-EDA) and the Adaptive Extended Tree Cliqued - EDA (AETC-EDA), and the Boltzmann selection procedure is used in CG-Sampler. They are tested with 5 known functions defined for 48, 50, 99 and 100 variables, and compared to Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm (UMDA).

Some practical systems, such as the large power system, usually exhibits the characters of multiple time scale and interconnections among subsystems. Thus, the interconnected fuzzy singular perturbed model is proposed to model such industrial system. Additionally, the fuzzy singular perturbed model with multiple perturbation parameters can describe a nonlinear multiple time scale system more precisely than the one with a single perturbation param- eter. However, the concentrated control of interconnected fuzzy singular perturbed model can not achieve excellent performance due to the interconnection term. Sometimes the interconnection term, which can be regarded as the external disturbance, may even lead to divergence in the control system. Thus, in this paper, the decentralized multi-objective robust controller is proposed. On one hand, the control of the fuzzy singular perturbed model can achieve good results under the condition of cross-linking among the subsystems by using the decentralized controller. On the other hand, a multi-extreme optimization model is established considering the noise resistance level, dynamical performance and the control input amplitude comprehensively. The method of Estimation of Distribution Algorithms is utilized to solve this optimization model. Numerical Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the method proposed in this paper.",

In EDAs, a model is learned from the selected population that encodes interactions among problem variables. New individuals are generated by sampling the model and incorporated into the population. Different probabilistic models have been used in EDAs to learn interactions. Bayesian network (BN) is a well-known graphical model which is used in BOA. Learning a proper model in EDAs and particularly in BOA is distinguished as a computationally expensive task. Different methods have been proposed in the literature to improve the complexity of model building in EDAs. This paper employs bivariate dependencies to learn accurate BNs in BOA efficiently. The proposed approach extracts the bivariate dependencies using an appropriate pairwise interaction-detection metric. Due to the static structure of the underlying problems, these dependencies are used in each generation of BOA to learn an accurate network. By using this approach, the computational cost of model building is reduced dramatically. Various optimization problems are selected to be solved by the algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed approach successfully finds the optimum in problems with different, types of interactions efficiently. Significant speedups are observed in the model building procedure as well.",

        "description": "Prudent decision making in subsurface assets requires reservoir uncertainty quantification. In a typical uncertainty-quantification study, reservoir models must be updated using the observed response from the reservoir by a process known as history matching. This involves solving an inverse problem, finding reservoir models that produce, under simulation, a similar response to that of the real reservoir. However, this requires multiple expensive multiphase-flow simulations. Thus, uncertainty-quantification studies employ optimization techniques to find acceptable models to be used in prediction. Different optimization algorithms and search strategies are presented in the literature, but they are generally unsatisfactory because of slow convergence to the optimal regions of the global search space, and, more importantly, failure in finding multiple acceptable reservoir models. In this context, a new approach is offered by estimation-of-distribution algorithms (EDAs). EDAs are population-based algorithms that use models to estimate the probability distribution of promising solutions and then generate new candidate solutions.|This paper explores the application of EDAs, including univariate and multivariate models. We discuss two histogram-based univariate models and one multivariate model, the Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA), which employs Bayesian networks for modeling. By considering possible interactions between variables and exploiting explicitly stored knowledge of such interactions, EDAs can accelerate the search process while preserving search diversity. Unlike most existing approaches applied to uncertainty quantification, the Bayesian network allows the BOA to build solutions using flexible rules learned from the models obtained, rather than fixed rules, leading to better solutions and improved convergence. The BOA is naturally suited to finding good solutions in complex high-dimensional spaces, such as those typical in reservoir-uncertainty quantification.|We demonstrate the effectiveness of EDA by applying the well-known synthetic PUNQ-S3 case with multiple wells. This allows us to verify the methodology in a well-controlled case. Results show better estimation of uncertainty when compared with some other traditional population-based algorithms.",

A Gaussian distribution over continuous variables is commonly used, with several different covariance matrix structures ranging from diagonal i.e. Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm (UMDA(c)) to full i.e. Estimation of Multivariate Normal density Algorithm (EMNA). A diagonal covariance model is simple but is unable to directly represent covariances between problem variables. On the other hand, a full covariance model requires estimation of (more) parameters from the selected population. In practice, numerical issues can arise with this estimation problem. In addition, the performance of the model has been shown to be sometimes undesirable. In this paper, a modified Gaussian-based continuous EDA is proposed, called sEDA, that provides a mechanism to control the amount of covariance parameters estimated within the Gaussian model. To achieve this, a simple variable screening technique from experimental design is adapted and combined with an idea inspired by the Pareto-front in multi-objective optimization. Compared to EMNA(global), the algorithm provides improved numerical stability and can use a smaller selected population.

The proposed model uses the estimation of distribution algorithms (EDA's) for the short-term projection of the returns of such stocks. The EDAs, unlike other optimization techniques that are based on traditional evolution algorithms, provide greater statistical robustness in shaping the population of individuals and with respect to the number of generations that are required to solve the problem. For this purpose the EDA incorporates three dynamic populations that explore the solution space of the problem by using a mechanism which propagates the differences that exist among the best individuals. Additionally, it includes a strategy to preserve the diversity of the population. The proposed model allowed short-term projections for the future values of the returns of Ecopetrol stocks, departing from a set of parameters and variables that make up the stock price.

In the Factorized Distribution Algorithm (FDA), a factorization is built from an ADF by choosing a subset of the factors. I present a new algorithm to merge factors into larger sets, allowing to account for all dependencies between the variables. Estimating larger subset distributions is more prone to sample noise, so the larger distribution can be estimated from the smaller ones with the Maximum Entropy method. Building an exact graphical model for sampling is often infeasible. E.g. in a 2-D grid the triangulated Markov network has linear clique size, thus exponentially large distributions. I explore ways to use loopy models and Generalized Belief Propagation in the context of EDA and optimization. The merging algorithm mentioned above can be combined with this.",

The key idea behind these EDAs was to factorise the joint probability distribution of solution variables in terms of cliques in the undirected graph. As such, they made use of the global Markov property of the Markov network in one form or another. This paper presents a Markov Network based EDA that is based on the use of the local Markov property, the Markovianity, and does not directly model the joint distribution. We call it Markovianity based Optimisation Algorithm. The algorithm combines a novel method for extracting the neighbourhood structure from the mutual information between the variables, with a Gibbs sampler method to generate new points. We present an extensive empirical validation of the algorithm on problems with complex interactions, comparing its performance with other EDAs that use higher order interactions. We extend the analysis to other functions with discrete representation, where EDA results are scarce, comparing the algorithm with state of the art EDAs that use marginal product factorisations.",

We apply this methodology to investigate the specific issue of explicit dependency modeling in simple continuous estimation of distribution algorithms. Experimental results reveal specific examples of landscapes (with certain identifiable features) where dependency modeling is useful, harmful, or has little impact on mean algorithm performance. Heat maps are used to compare algorithm performance over a large number of landscape instances and algorithm trials. Finally, we perform a meta-search in the landscape parameter space to find landscapes which maximize the performance between algorithms. The results are related to some previous intuition about the behavior of these algorithms, but at the same time lead to new insights into the relationship between dependency modeling in EDAs and the structure of the problem landscape. The landscape generator and overall methodology are quite general and extendable and can be used to examine specific features of other algorithms.",

In this paper, a new probabilistic model is proposed to capture the variable linkages together with the univariate probabilistic model where most EDAs could use only one statistic information. This proposed algorithm is named extended artificial chromosomes with genetic algorithm (eACGA). We investigate the usefulness of the probabilistic models and to compare eACGA with several famous permutation-oriented EDAs on the benchmark instances of the permutation flowshop scheduling problems (PFSPs). eACGA yields better solution quality for makespan criterion when we use the average error ratio metric as their performance measures. In addition, eACGA is further integrated with well-known heuristic algorithms, such as NEH and variable neighborhood search (VNS) and it is denoted as eACGA(hybrid) to solve the considered problems.

Most EDAs explicitly use the probabilistic model to sample new solutions without using traditional genetic operators. EDAs make good use of the global statistical information collected from previous searches but they do not efficiently use the location information about individual solutions. It is recently realized that global statistical information and location information should complement each other during the evolution process. In view of this, we design the Self-guided GA based on a novel strategy to combine these two kinds of information. The Self-guided GA does not sample new solutions from the probabilistic model. Instead, it estimates the quality of a candidate offspring based on the probabilistic model used in its crossover and mutation operations. In such a way, the mutation and crossover operations are able to generate fitter solutions, thus improving the performance of the algorithm. We tested the proposed algorithm by applying it to deal with the NP-complete flowshop scheduling problem to minimize the makespan. The experimental results show that the Self-guided GA is very promising. We also demonstrate that the Self-guided GA can be easily extended to treat other intractable combinatorial problems.

The purpose of this paper is to describe a method that combines such a problem-specific distance metric with information mined from probabilistic models obtained in previous runs of estimation of distribution algorithms with the goal of solving future problem instances of similar type with increased speed, accuracy and reliability. While the focus of the paper is on additively decomposable problems and the hierarchical Bayesian optimization algorithm, it should be straightforward to generalize the approach to other model-directed optimization techniques and other problem classes.

While the primary goal of applying EDAs is to discover the global optimum or at least its accurate approximation, besides this, any EDA provides us with a sequence of probabilistic models, which in most cases hold a great deal of information about the problem. Although using problem-specific knowledge has been shown to significantly improve performance of EDAs and other evolutionary algorithms, this readily available source of problem-specific information has been practically ignored by the EDA community. This paper takes the first step toward the use of probabilistic models obtained by EDAs to speed up the solution of similar problems in the future. More specifically, we propose two approaches to biasing model building in the hierarchical Bayesian optimization algorithm (hBOA) based on knowledge automatically learned from previous hBOA runs on similar problems. We show that the proposed methods lead to substantial speedups and argue that the methods should work well in other applications that require solving a large number of problems with similar structure.",

This aim is achieved by incorporating the following mechanisms: (1) selection is applied to the local best solutions in order to obtain more promising individuals for model building, (2) a probabilistic model of the problem is built from the selected solutions, and (3) new individuals are generated by a stochastic combination of the EDA's model sampling method and the PSO's particle moving mechanism. To exhibit the utility of the EPSDA framework, an extended compact particle swarm optimization (EcPSO) is developed by combining the strengths of the extended compact genetic algorithm (EcGA) with binary PSO (BPSO), along the lines of the suggested framework. Due to its effective nature of harmonizing the global search of EcGA with the local search of BPSO, EcPSO is able to discover the optimal solution in a fast and reliable manner.

        "description": "Estimation-of-Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) build and use probabilistic models during optimization in order to automatically discover and use an optimization problems' structure. This is especially useful for black-box optimization where no assumptions are made on the problem being solved, which is characteristic of many cases in solving complex real-world problems. In this paper we consider multi-objective optimization problems with real-valued variables. Although the vast majority of advances in EDA literature concern single-objective optimization, advances have also been made in multi-objective optimization. In this paper we bring together two recent advances, namely incremental Gaussian model building to reduce the required population size and a mixture-based multi-objective framework that has specific methods to better facilitate model-building techniques that span multiple generations. Significantly faster convergence to the optimal Pareto front is achieved on 6 out of 7 artificial benchmark problems from literature. Although results on two of these problems show that building models with higher-order interactions between variables is required, these problems are still artificial. We therefore also consider a more realistic optimization problem in image processing, namely deformable image registration. For this problem too, our results show the need for processing interactions between problem variables, stressing the importance of studying the use of such models. Furthermore, the number of problem variables in the deformable image registration problem can be very large. The building of models with higher-order interactions, especially mixture-based models, then requires very large population sizes. The use of incremental model building is therefore of high importance. This claim is supported by our results that show a huge reduction in the number of required evaluations on this problem.",

However, their internal behavior is still not completely understood and therefore it is necessary to work in this direction in order to advance their development. This paper presents a methodology of analysis which provides new information about the behavior of EDAs by quantitatively analyzing the probabilistic models learned during the search. We particularly focus on calculating the probabilities of the optimal solutions, the most probable solution given by the model and the best individual of the population at each step of the algorithm. We carry out the analysis by optimizing functions of different nature such as Trap5, two variants of Ising spin glass and Max-SAT. By using different structures in the probabilistic models, we also analyze the impact of the structural model accuracy in the quantitative behavior of EDAs. In addition, the objective function values of our analyzed key solutions are contrasted with their probability values in order to study the connection between function and probabilistic models. The results not only show information about the internal behavior of EDAs, but also about the quality of the optimization process and setup of the parameters, the relationship between the probabilistic model and the fitness function, and even about the problem itself. Furthermore, the results allow us to discover common patterns of behavior in EDAs and propose new ideas in the development of this type of algorithms.",

By applying our approach to benchmark tests, we show that the proposed method is more effective than PLS alone.",

        "authors": "Kang, Q, An, J, Wu, QD",
        "description": "Swarm intelligence is a kind of nature-inspired heuristic optimization technique. Different computation models usually take on relative uniform characteristic though they usually have distinct extrinsic forms. These intelligent algorithms are coupling with deterministic and stochastic, the contradiction between necessity and accidental unity, which promotes the \"evolution\" of the inheritance and the creative process: \"stochastic\" is adopted to give creative ability to the implemented \"intelligent system\", and a succession of \"certainty\" is acted to ensure the system is converging. In this paper, a computing framework of generalized swarm intelligence is proposed based on the unifying idea. The unified hiberarchy model and formalization description for swarm intelligence are represented. Several typical swarm intelligence algorithms, such as ant colony system (ACS), particle swarm optimization (PSO), estimation of distribution algorithms (EDA) and artificial immune algorithms (AIA) are addressed to validate the uniform idea of swarm intelligence, respectively.",

        "authors": "Iacca, G, Caraffini, F and Neri, F",
        "description": "Compact algorithms are Estimation of Distribution Algorithms which mimic the behavior of population-based algorithms by means of a probabilistic representation of the population of candidate solutions. These algorithms have a similar behaviour with respect to population-based algorithms but require a much smaller memory. This feature is crucially important in some engineering applications, especially in robotics. A high performance compact algorithm is the compact Differential Evolution (cDE) algorithm. This paper proposes a novel implementation of cDE, namely compact Differential Evolution light (cDElight), to address not only the memory saving necessities but also real-time requirements. cDElight employs two novel algorithmic modifications for employing a smaller computational overhead without a performance loss, with respect to cDE. Numerical results, carried out on a broad set of test problems, show that cDElight, despite its minimal hardware requirements, does not deteriorate the performance of cDE and thus is competitive with other memory saving and population-based algorithms. An application in the field of mobile robotics highlights the usability and advantages of the proposed approach.",

This algorithm has better performance compared to others such as genetic algorithm in terms of speed, memory consumption and accuracy of solutions. It can explore unknown parts of search space well. It uses a probability vector and individuals of the population are created through the sampling. Furthermore, EO algorithm is suitable for local search of near global best solution in search space, and it does not stuck in local optimum.

        "description": "The emergence of different metaheuristics and their new variants in recent years has made the definition of the term Evolutionary Algorithms unclear. Originally, it was coined to put a group of stochastic search algorithms that mimic natural evolution together. While some people would still see it as a specific term devoted to this group of algorithms, including Genetic Algorithms, Genetic Programming, Evolution Strategies, Evolutionary Programming, and to a lesser extent Differential Evolution and Estimation of Distribution Algorithms, many others would regard \"Evolutionary Algorithms\" as a general term describing population-based search methods that involve some form of randomness and selection. In this chapter, we re-visit the fundamental question of \"what is an Evolutionary Algorithm?\" not only from the traditional viewpoint but also the wider, more modern perspectives relating it to other areas of Evolutionary Computation. To do so, apart from discussing the main characteristics of this family of algorithms we also look at Memetic Algorithms and the Swarm Intelligence algorithms. From our discussion, we see that establishing semantic borders between these algorithm families is not always easy, nor necessarily useful. It is anticipated that they will further converge as the research from these areas cross-fertilizes each other.",

        "authors": "Ponce-de-Leon-Senti, EE and Diaz-Diaz, E",
        "description": "This chapter introduces Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) based on a learning strategy with two steps. The first step is based on the estimation of the searching sample complexity through an index based on the sample entropy. The searching sample algorithm learns a tree, and then, uses a sample complexity index to prognose the missing edges to obtain the cliques of the structure of the estimating distribution adding more edges if necessary. In the second step a new population is generated by a new cliqued Gibbs sampler (CG-Sampler) that drags through the space of solutions driven by the cliques of the learned graphical Markov model. Two variants of this algorithm are compared, the Adaptive Tree Cliqued - EDA (ATC-EDA) and the Adaptive Extended Tree Cliqued - EDA (AETC-EDA), and the Boltzmann selection procedure is used in CG-Sampler. They are tested with 5 known functions defined for 48, 50, 99 and 100 variables, and compared to Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm (UMDA). The performance of the two algorithms compared to UMDA is equal for OneMax and ZeroMax functions. The ATC-EDA and AETC-EDA are better than the UMDA for the other 3 functions.",

        "authors": "Yuan, Y, Sun, FC and Hu, YN",
        "description": "This paper investigates the decentralized multi-objective robust control for the interconnected fuzzy singular perturbed model with multiple perturbation parameters. Some practical systems, such as the large power system, usually exhibits the characters of multiple time scale and interconnections among subsystems. Thus, the interconnected fuzzy singular perturbed model is proposed to model such industrial system. Additionally, the fuzzy singular perturbed model with multiple perturbation parameters can describe a nonlinear multiple time scale system more precisely than the one with a single perturbation param- eter. However, the concentrated control of interconnected fuzzy singular perturbed model can not achieve excellent performance due to the interconnection term. Sometimes the interconnection term, which can be regarded as the external disturbance, may even lead to divergence in the control system. Thus, in this paper, the decentralized multi-objective robust controller is proposed. On one hand, the control of the fuzzy singular perturbed model can achieve good results under the condition of cross-linking among the subsystems by using the decentralized controller. On the other hand, a multi-extreme optimization model is established considering the noise resistance level, dynamical performance and the control input amplitude comprehensively. The method of Estimation of Distribution Algorithms is utilized to solve this optimization model. Numerical Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the method proposed in this paper.",

        "description": "Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA) is one of the successful and widely used estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) which have been employed to solve different optimization problems. In EDAs, a model is learned from the selected population that encodes interactions among problem variables. New individuals are generated by sampling the model and incorporated into the population. Different probabilistic models have been used in EDAs to learn interactions. Bayesian network (BN) is a well-known graphical model which is used in BOA. Learning a proper model in EDAs and particularly in BOA is distinguished as a computationally expensive task. Different methods have been proposed in the literature to improve the complexity of model building in EDAs. This paper employs bivariate dependencies to learn accurate BNs in BOA efficiently. The proposed approach extracts the bivariate dependencies using an appropriate pairwise interaction-detection metric. Due to the static structure of the underlying problems, these dependencies are used in each generation of BOA to learn an accurate network. By using this approach, the computational cost of model building is reduced dramatically. Various optimization problems are selected to be solved by the algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed approach successfully finds the optimum in problems with different, types of interactions efficiently. Significant speedups are observed in the model building procedure as well.",

        "authors": "Abdollahzadeh, A, Reynolds, A, Williams, G",
        "description": "Prudent decision making in subsurface assets requires reservoir uncertainty quantification. In a typical uncertainty-quantification study, reservoir models must be updated using the observed response from the reservoir by a process known as history matching. This involves solving an inverse problem, finding reservoir models that produce, under simulation, a similar response to that of the real reservoir. However, this requires multiple expensive multiphase-flow simulations. Thus, uncertainty-quantification studies employ optimization techniques to find acceptable models to be used in prediction. Different optimization algorithms and search strategies are presented in the literature, but they are generally unsatisfactory because of slow convergence to the optimal regions of the global search space, and, more importantly, failure in finding multiple acceptable reservoir models. In this context, a new approach is offered by estimation-of-distribution algorithms (EDAs). EDAs are population-based algorithms that use models to estimate the probability distribution of promising solutions and then generate new candidate solutions.|This paper explores the application of EDAs, including univariate and multivariate models. We discuss two histogram-based univariate models and one multivariate model, the Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA), which employs Bayesian networks for modeling. By considering possible interactions between variables and exploiting explicitly stored knowledge of such interactions, EDAs can accelerate the search process while preserving search diversity. Unlike most existing approaches applied to uncertainty quantification, the Bayesian network allows the BOA to build solutions using flexible rules learned from the models obtained, rather than fixed rules, leading to better solutions and improved convergence. The BOA is naturally suited to finding good solutions in complex high-dimensional spaces, such as those typical in reservoir-uncertainty quantification.|We demonstrate the effectiveness of EDA by applying the well-known synthetic PUNQ-S3 case with multiple wells. This allows us to verify the methodology in a well-controlled case. Results show better estimation of uncertainty when compared with some other traditional population-based algorithms.",
