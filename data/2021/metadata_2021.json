        "description": "Optimization problems are ubiquitous in every field, and they are becoming more and more complex, which greatly challenges the effectiveness of existing optimization methods. To solve the increasingly complicated optimization problems with high effectiveness, this paper proposes an adaptive covariance scaling estimation of distribution algorithm (ACSEDA) based on the Gaussian distribution model. Unlike traditional EDAs, which estimate the covariance and the mean vector, based on the same selected promising individuals, ACSEDA calculates the covariance according to an enlarged number of promising individuals (compared with those for the mean vector). To alleviate the sensitivity of the parameters in promising individual selections, this paper further devises an adaptive promising individual selection strategy for the estimation of the mean vector and an adaptive covariance scaling strategy for the covariance estimation. These two adaptive strategies dynamically adjust the associated numbers of promising individuals as the evolution continues. In addition, we further devise a cross-generation individual selection strategy for the parent population, used to estimate the probability distribution by combing the sampled offspring in the last generation and the one in the current generation. With the above mechanisms, ACSEDA is expected to compromise intensification and diversification of the search process to explore and exploit the solution space and thus could achieve promising performance. To verify the effectiveness of ACSEDA, extensive experiments are conducted on 30 widely used benchmark optimization problems with different dimension sizes. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ACSEDA presents significant superiority to several state-of-the-art EDA variants, and it preserves good scalability in solving optimization problems.",

        "authors": "Doerr, Benjamin Krejca, Martin S.",
        "description": "In their recent work, Lehre and Nguyen (2019) show that the univariate marginal distribution algorithm (UMDA) needs time exponential in the parent populations size to optimize the DeceptiveLeadingBlocks (DLB) problem. They conclude from this result that univariate EDAs have difficulties with deception and epistasis. In this work, we show that this negative finding is caused by the choice of the parameters of the UMDA. When the population sizes are chosen large enough to prevent genetic drift, then the UMDA optimizes the DLB problem with high probability with at most lambda(n/2+2e ln n) fitness evaluations. Since an offspring population size lambda of order nlogn can prevent genetic drift, the UMDA can solve the DLB problem with O(n(2) log n) fitness evaluations. In contrast, for classic evolutionary algorithms no better runtime guarantee than O(n(3)) is known (which we prove to be tight for the (1+1) EA), so our result rather suggests that the UMDA can cope well with deception and epistatis. From a broader perspective, our result shows that the UMDA can cope better with local optima than many classic evolutionary algorithms; such a result was previously known only for the compact genetic algorithm. Together with the lower bound of Lehre and Nguyen, our result for the first time rigorously proves that running EDAs in the regime with genetic drift can lead to drastic performance losses.",

However, it is not easy to take comfortability into account when designing a powertrain control strategy because of its subjective nature and difficulty in being quantified. This paper presents a solution by using the inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) method. An acceleration scenario of a hybrid electric powertrain is considered to show this design approach. With a sample acceleration profile scored by an expert evaluating module, a reward function is obtained by training an extreme learning machine. Using the analytical representation of comfortability, an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) is used to seek the optimal acceleration reference. Given the reference acceleration signal, the control law for the electric motors that provide power assistance during the acceleration phase is obtained by solving a optimal tracking control problem.

        "authors": "Chen, Zong-Gan Lin, Ying Gong, Yue-Jiao Zhan, Zhi-Hui Zhang, Jun",
        "description": "Sensor activity scheduling is critical for prolonging the lifetime of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). However, most existing methods assume sensors to have one fixed sensing range. Prevalence of sensors with adjustable sensing ranges posts two new challenges to the topic: 1) expanded search space, due to the rise in the number of possible activation modes and 2) more complex energy allocation, as the sensors differ in the energy consumption rate when using different sensing ranges. These two challenges make it hard to directly solve the lifetime maximization problem of WSNs with range-adjustable sensors (LM-RASs). This article proposes a neighborhood-based estimation of distribution algorithm (NEDA) to address it in a recursive manner. In NEDA, each individual represents a coverage scheme in which the sensors are selectively activated to monitor all the targets. A linear programming (LP) model is built to assign activation time to the schemes in the population so that their sum, the network lifetime, can be maximized conditioned on the current population. Using the activation time derived from LP as individual fitness, the NEDA is driven to seek coverage schemes promising for prolonging the network lifetime. The network lifetime is thus optimized by repeating the steps of the coverage scheme evolution and LP model solving. To encourage the search for diverse coverage schemes, a neighborhood sampling strategy is introduced. Besides, a heuristic repair strategy is designed to fine-tune the existing schemes for further improving the search efficiency. Experimental results on WSNs of different scales show that NEDA outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. It is also expected that NEDA can serve as a potential framework for solving other flexible LP problems that share the same structure with LM-RAS.",

        "description": "Reasonable setting of traffic signals can be very helpful in alleviating congestion in urban traffic networks. Meta-heuristic optimization algorithms have proved themselves to be able to find high quality signal timing plans. However, they generally suffer from performance deterioration when solving large-scale traffic signal optimization problems due to the huge search space and limited computational budget. Directing against this issue, this study proposes a surrogate-assisted cooperative signal optimization (SCSO) method. Different from existing methods that directly deal with the entire traffic network, SCSO first decomposes it into a set of tractable sub-networks, and then achieves signal setting by cooperatively optimizing these sub-networks with a surrogate-assisted optimizer. The decomposition operation significantly narrows the search space of the whole traffic network, and the surrogate-assisted optimizer greatly lowers the computational burden by reducing the number of expensive traffic simulations. By taking Newman fast algorithm, radial basis function and a modified estimation of distribution algorithm as decomposer, surrogate model and optimizer, respectively, this study develops a concrete SCSO algorithm. To evaluate its effectiveness and efficiency, a large-scale traffic network involving crossroads and T-junctions is generated based on a real traffic network. Comparison with several existing meta-heuristic algorithms specially designed for traffic signal optimization demonstrates the superiority of SCSO in reducing the average delay time of vehicles.

        "authors": "Li, Jian-Yu Zhan, Zhi-Hui Xu, Jin Kwong, Sam Zhang, Jun",
        "description": "The performance of a convolutional neural network (CNN) heavily depends on its hyperparameters. However, finding a suitable hyperparameters configuration is difficult, challenging, and computationally expensive due to three issues, which are 1) the mixed-variable problem of different types of hyperparameters; 2) the large-scale search space of finding optimal hyperparameters; and 3) the expensive computational cost for evaluating candidate hyperparameters configuration. Therefore, this article focuses on these three issues and proposes a novel estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) for efficient hyperparameters optimization, with three major contributions in the algorithm design. First, a hybrid-model EDA is proposed to efficiently deal with the mixed-variable difficulty. The proposed algorithm uses a mixed-variable encoding scheme to encode the mixed-variable hyperparameters and adopts an adaptive hybrid-model learning (AHL) strategy to efficiently optimize the mixed-variables. Second, an orthogonal initialization (OI) strategy is proposed to efficiently deal with the challenge of large-scale search space. Third, a surrogate-assisted multi-level evaluation (SME) method is proposed to reduce the expensive computational cost. Based on the above, the proposed algorithm is named surrogate-assisted hybrid-model EDA (SHEDA). For experimental studies, the proposed SHEDA is verified on widely used classification benchmark problems, and is compared with various state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, a case study on aortic dissection (AD) diagnosis is carried out to evaluate its performance. Experimental results show that the proposed SHEDA is very effective and efficient for hyperparameters optimization, which can find a satisfactory hyperparameters configuration for the CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and AD diagnosis with only 0.58, 0.97, and 1.18 GPU days, respectively.",

        "description": "The aim of the quay crane scheduling problem (QCSP) is to identify the best sequence of discharging and loading operations for a set of quay cranes. This problem is solved with a new hybrid estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA). The approach is proposed to tackle the drawbacks of the EDAs, i.e., the lack of diversity of solutions and poor ability of exploitation. The hybridization approach, used in this investigation, uses a distance based ranking model and the moth-flame algorithm. The distance based ranking model is in charge of modelling the solution space distribution, through an exponential function, by measuring the distance between solutions; meanwhile, the heuristic moth-flame determines who would be the offspring, with a spiral function that identifies the new locations for the new solutions. Based on the results, the proposed scheme, called QCEDA, works to enhance the performance of those other EDAs that use complex probability models. The dispersion results of the QCEDA scheme are less than the other algorithms used in the comparison section. This means that the solutions found by the QCEDA are more concentrated around the best value than other algorithms, i.e., the average of the solutions of the QCEDA converges better than other approaches to the best found value. Finally, as a conclusion, the hybrid EDAs have a better performance, or equal in effectiveness, than the so called pure EDAs.",

The algorithm has a nested form, where a differential evolution is applied for both the design and scenario space optimization. To reduce the computational cost, we estimate the distribution of the best worst solution for the best solutions found so far. The probabilistic model is used to sample part of the initial population of the scenario space differential evolution, using a priori knowledge of the previous generations.

All reconfigurable system resources constitute a design space and the proper selection of configuration of these resources to improve the system performance is known as Design Space Exploration (DSE). This reconfiguration feature helps in appropriate allocation of system resources to improve the efficiency in terms of performance, energy consumption, throughput, etc. Different techniques like exhaustive search of design space, architect's experience, etc. are used for optimization of system resources to achieve desired goals. In this work, we hybridized two optimization algorithms, i.e., Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) for DSE of computer architecture. This hybrid algorithm achieved optimal balance between two objectives (minimal energy consumption and maximal throughput) by using decision variables such as number of cores, cache size and operating frequency. The final set of optimal solutions proposed by this GA-EDA hybrid algorithm is explored and verified by running different benchmark applications derived from SPLASH-2 benchmark suite on a cycle level simulator. The significant reduction in energy consumption without extensive impact on throughput in simulation results validate the use of this GA-EDA hybrid algorithm for DSE of multicore architecture.

        "description": "With the rapid development of the insurance industry, more diverse insurance products are produced for consumers. Insurance portfolio problems have received increasing attention. While most studies focus on insurance portfolio problem for a single insured, insurance portfolio problems for a specific group of insured are even more intricate but little attention has been paid to. In this article, we propose a group insurance portfolio model for investment allocation of several insurance policies so that the total payout of the whole group can be maximized. The statistical average value of each parameter is considered in the model to approximate the expectation payout of the group insurance portfolio problem. To solve this problem, a coevolutionary estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) utilizing the divide-and-conquer strategy is proposed. First, as the payout of each insured under a certain portfolio plan can be calculated separately, the proposed approach decomposes the group insurance portfolio problem into several single-insured insurance portfolio problems. In this way, the dimension of the optimization problem becomes lower compared to the original problem. An adaptive EDA is proposed to optimize the portfolio plan of each insured independently. Second, the group insurance portfolio problem remains a nonseparable problem since the investment amount of each insured is limited by the total investable amount of the whole group. A particle swarm optimization algorithm is adopted to cooperate with the EDA to optimize the proportion of allocation to each insured. The proposed algorithm is verified on various scenarios. The experimental results validate that the proposed approach is effective for the group insurance portfolio problem.",

This model considers two states, susceptible and infected, divides the population into sexes, assumes only heterosexual contacts and includes different transmission rates depending on whether the transmission is woman-man or man-woman. Reported and prevalence series data are retrieved from several sources. We consider the inherent data survey errors and the sensitivity of the diagnosis tests (data uncertainty). To calibrate the model to the available data and their uncertainty, a novel technique is proposed in two steps: (1) the application of the estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) to find sets of model parameter values close to the data uncertainty and (2) the application of a selection algorithm to get a reduced number of model parameter values whose model outputs capture accurately the data uncertainty. Then, we check its robustness, and we provide a prediction of the evolution of the infected over the next 4 years. From the technical point of view, we conclude that the proposed technique to calibrate probabilistically the model is reliable and robust. Also, it is able to provide confidence intervals for the model parameter values and the predictions. From the medical point of view, the model returns that the transmission woman-man is higher than the man-woman, according to recent literature, and there is a mild increasing trend in the number of infected people over the next years.",

        "description": "The ability to assess the reliability of safety-critical systems is one of the most crucial requirements in the design of modern safety-critical systems where even a minor failure can result in loss of life or irreparable damage to the environment. Model checking is an automatic technique that verifies or refutes system properties by exploring all reachable states (state space) of a model. In large and complex systems, it is probable that the state space explosion problem occurs. In exploring the state space of systems modeled by graph transformations, the rule applied on the current state specifies the rule that can perform on the next state. In other words, the allowed rule on the current state depends only on the applied rule on the previous state, not the ones on earlier states. This fact motivates us to use a Markov chain (MC) to capture this type of dependencies and applies the Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) to improve the quality of the MC. EDA is an evolutionary algorithm directing the search for the optimal solution by learning and sampling probabilistic models through the best individuals of a population at each generation. To show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we implement it in GROOVE, an open source toolset for designing and model checking graph transformation systems. Experimental results confirm that the proposed approach has a high speed and accuracy in comparison with the existing meta-heuristic and evolutionary techniques in safety analysis of systems specified formally through graph transformations.",

        "description": "Estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) is an efficient population-based stochastic search technique. Since it was proposed, many attempts have been made to improve its performance in the context of nonlinear continuous optimization. However, the success of EDA depends on the accuracy of modeling, the effectiveness of sampling, and the ability of exploration. An effective EDA often needs to take some measures to adjust the model and to guide sampling. In this article, we propose a novel EDA which applies the idea of Kalman filtering to revise the modeling data and a learning strategy to improve sampling. The filtering scheme modifies the modeling data set using an estimation error matrix based on historic solution data. During the sampling process, the learning strategy determines the region to sample next based on the sampling outcomes so far, instead of completely random sampling. The proposed EDA also employs a multivariate probabilistic model based on copula function and can quickly reach the promising area in which the optimal solution is likely to be located. A collection of general benchmark functions are used to test the performance of the proposed algorithm. Computational experiments show that the EDA is effective. Note to Practitioners-In many process industries, there exist black-box operation optimization problems and large-scale nonlinear optimization problems with variable coupling. For these problems, it is difficult to establish mechanism models between input and output. However, real-time data can be measured from the system through sensors. We can utilize this process information to optimize the system so as to attain the desired objective. In this article, we propose a novel estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) which applies a filtering scheme to revise the modeling data and a learning strategy to improve sampling, which can solve the problems with the characteristics of nonlinearity, variable coupling, and large scale. Computational experiments show that the EDA is effective. In the future, the proposed algorithm can be applied to some practical optimization problems such as operation optimization in blast furnace, which is considered as a continuous production process with variable coupling. The algorithm has the potential to help optimizing the process control parameters.",

Because of the nature of a deep generative model, the generated material distributions are diverse and inherit features of the training data, that is, the elite material distributions. Therefore, it is expected that some of the generated material distributions are superior to the current elite material distributions, and by merging the generated material distributions with the dataset, the performances of the newly selected elite material distributions are improved. The performances are further improved by iterating the above processes. The usefulness of data-driven topology design is demonstrated through numerical examples.",

        "description": "Under the current volatile business environment, the requirement of flexible production is becoming increasingly urgent. As an innovative production mode, seru-system with reconfigurability can overcome the lack of flexibility in traditional flow lines. Compared with pure seru-system, the hybrid seru-system composed of both serus and production lines is more practical for adapting to many production processes. This paper addresses a specific hybrid seru-system scheduling optimization problem (HSSOP), which includes three strongly coupled sub-problems, i.e., hybrid seru formation, seru scheduling and flow line scheduling. To minimize the makespan of the whole hybrid seru-system, we propose an efficient cooperative coevolution algorithm (CCA). To tackle three sub-problems, specific sub-algorithms are designed based on the characteristic of each sub-problem, i.e., a sub-space exploitation algorithm for hybrid seru formation, an estimation of distribution algorithm for seru scheduling, and a first-arrive-first-process heuristic for flow line scheduling. Since three sub-problems are coupled, a cooperation coevolution mechanism is proposed for the integrated algorithm by information sharing. Moreover, a batch reassign rule is designed to overcome the mismatch of partial solutions during cooperative coevolution. To enhance the exploitation ability, problem-specific local search methods are designed and embedded in the CCA. In addition to the investigation about the effect of parameter setting, extensive computational tests and comparisons are carried out which demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the CCA in solving the HSSOP.",

        "description": "The vehicle routing environment has been widely studied under different approaches. It is due to its practical characteristic that makes its research interesting. Therefore, the vehicle-scheduling problem continues being attracted to develop new evolutionary algorithms. In this paper, we propose a new estimation of distribution algorithm coupled with a radial probability function. The aforementioned radial function comes from the hydrogen element. Continuous values, for the solution representation, are used in this research. Each value represents the distance, in picometers, between the electron and the core of the hydrogen atom. The representation, elected in this research, is suitable to integrate the radial probability distribution as a probability model. This approach is proposed in order to build a competitive estimation of distribution algorithm for the vehicle routing problem with time windows. The key point is to exploit the radial probability distribution to construct offspring, and to tackle the inconvenient of the estimation of distribution algorithms, i.e., lack of diversity of the solutions and poor ability of exploitation. In addition, this paper omits to use permutation-based representation as other recent estimation of distribution algorithms. Various instances and numerical experiments are presented to illustrate, and to validate this novel research. The results, obtained from this research, permits to conclude that using radial probability distributions is an emerging field to develop new and efficient EDAs.",

The traditional way of neural network training is a gradient-based algorithm, which suffers the disadvantage of gradient disappearing, especially for the deeper neural network. Recently, a heuristic algorithm has been proposed for deeper neural network optimization. In this paper, a random mask and elitism univariate continuous estimation of distribution algorithm based on the Gaussian model is proposed to pre-train staked auto-encoder, and then a Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) based fine-tuning process is carried out for local searching. In the improved estimation of the distribution algorithm, two individual update strategies are defined; one group of individuals is generated according to the constructed probabilistic model, and another is updated according to the statistics of advanced individuals that aim to reduce the probability of combination explosion and time consumption according to the mask information. In the simulations, different architectures, different mask ratios and different promising individual ratios are adopted to testify the effectiveness of the improved algorithm.

Learning models for multiobjective estimation of distributions have led to improved search efficiency, but they incur a high computational cost owing to their use of a repetitive learning or iterative strategy. To overcome this drawback, we propose an algorithm for incremental-learning model-based multiobjective estimation of distribu-tions. A learning mechanism based on an incremental Gaussian mixture model is embed-ded within the search procedure. In the proposed algorithm, all new solutions generated during the evolution are passed to a data stream, which is fed incrementally into the learn-ing model to adaptively discover the structure of the Pareto-optimal set. The parameters of the model are updated continually as each newly generated datum is collected. Each datum is learned only once for the model, regardless of whether it has been preserved or deleted. Moreover, a sampling strategy based on the learned model is designed to balance the exploration/exploitation dilemma in the evolutionary search.

A mathematical model for this optimization problem is established with the objective of minimizing the function composed of vehicle cost, distribution cost, time window penalty cost and charging service cost.

Experimental results demonstrate that the EDA-LF algorithm can find better solutions and has stronger robustness than the basic EDA algorithm. In addition, when comparing with existing algorithms, the result shows that the EDA-LF can often get better solutions in a relatively short time when solving medium and large-scale instances.

Due to this, many resources and customers are involved in optimization, making ERM a complex problem. Moreover, when the inherent uncertainty of weather conditions, load forecast, electric vehicles planned trips, or market prices is considered, deterministic approaches might fail in obtaining optimal solutions to the problem. In this context, evolutionary algorithms are a useful tool to find effective near-optimal solutions. In fact, to design and test evolutionary algorithms to solve the ERM problem under uncertainty, the research community has developed a simulation framework. In this paper, we propose the Cellular Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm with Normal-Cauchy distribution (CUMDANCauchy) to address the ERM problem in uncertain environments. CUMDANCauchy uses a univariate estimation of the product of Normal and Cauchy distributions over each feature, and produces new individuals not only by the sampling of the learned distributions but also using neighborhoods of individuals from a ring cellular structure. The experiments performed over two case studies show that: CUMDANCauchy is as competitive as the previous dominant class of algorithms in terms of the global fitness achieved; its convergence behavior is among the best in comparison with the other tested algorithms; its running time is similar to the algorithm with the best global fitness achieved in the first case study, and it is the fastest algorithm in the second one.",

First, the cooperative path planning problem of UAVs &amp; UGVs is formulated into a large-scale 0-1 optimization problem, in which the on-off states of the discrete points are to be optimized. Second, a hybrid algorithm integrating the estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) and the genetic algorithm (GA) algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. The advantages of EDA and GA in the global and local search are fully taken considering the demands in different phases of the iterative process.

Such problems are potentially very difficult, for example, non-separable, multimodal, and multiobjective. The Gene-pool Optimal Mixing Evolutionary Algorithm (GOMEA) can effectively exploit partial evaluations, leading to a substantial improvement in performance and scalability.

For decision-makers, it is difficult to determine the optimal number of drones to ensure that all packages can be delivered before the corresponding deadline. We propose a mixed integer programming model formulate the problem. Due to the NP-hardness of the problem, a scheduling decision support model with a genetic algorithm (SDSMGA) is developed to address the problem. A fitness function that can determine the minimum number of drones required by a package delivery sequence is proposed. We develop a swap-based correction algorithm to correct unqualified individuals in SDSMGA. Experimental results show that compared with CPLEX for small instances, SDSMGA can obtain solutions of the same quality or sub-optimal solutions. Computational results among SDSMGA, Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) indicate that SDSMGA can effectively and efficiently address the problem.

        "description": "In financial decision making models, parameters are usually obtained based on historical data, which involve strong uncertainties. In some cases, the fluctuation caused by environmental uncertainty may even be more significant than that caused by utilizing different strategies. Such phenomenon makes the optimization and uncertainty handling in finical optimization a great challenge. In this article, a group insurance portfolio problem is considered as an instance of financial optimization with strong uncertainty. To handle uncertainty, we first analyze the feature of the problem and discover that in such kind of optimization problem with strong uncertainty, the solutions are strongly relative to the scenario. In view of the scenario-relevant feature, a simplified simulation approach is designed. Only one scenario is simulated for each generation in the evolution process to deal with the uncertainties. Combining this approach with a clustering estimation of distribution algorithm, a new algorithm (CEDA-SS) is proposed. Estimation of current profit is made by Monte Carlo (MC) simulation based on historical data. Solutions in each generation are evaluated in the same scenario. Two kinds of clustering mechanisms are applied to further improve the performance of the algorithm. Moreover, a comparison mechanism based on the Wilcoxon rank sum test is proposed to evaluate the performance of the algorithms. Experimental results show that the proposed CEDA-SS is suitable for the group insurance portfolio problem and it outperforms other uncertain evolutionary algorithms.",

        "description": "The distributed assembly permutation flow-shop scheduling problem (DAPFSP) is a typical NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem that has wide applications in advanced manufacturing systems and modern supply chains. In this work, an innovative three-dimensional matrix-cube-based estimation of distribution algorithm (MCEDA) is first proposed for the DAPFSP to minimize the maximum completion time. Firstly, a matrix cube is designed to learn the valuable information from elites. Secondly, a matrix-cube-based probabilistic model with an effective sampling mechanism is developed to estimate the probability distribution of superior solutions and to perform the global exploration for finding promising regions. Thirdly, a problem-dependent variable neighborhood descent method is proposed to perform the local exploitation around these promising regions, and several speedup strategies for evaluating neighboring solutions are utilized to enhance the computational efficiency. Furthermore, the influence of the parameters setting is analyzed by using design-of-experiment technique, and the suitable parameters are suggested for different scale problems. Finally, a comprehensive computational campaign against the state-of-the-art algorithms in the literature, together with statistical analyses, demonstrates that the proposed MCEDA produces better results than the existing algorithms by a significant margin. Moreover, the new best-known solutions for 214 instances are improved.",

        "description": "Operating distribution grids is increasingly challenging due to the increasing penetration of photovoltaic systems. To address these challenges, modern photovoltaic inverters include features for local control, which sometimes lead to suboptimal results. Improved communication infrastructure and photovoltaic inverters favour global control strategies, which receive information from all the systems in the grid. An estimation of distribution algorithm is used to optimize a global control strategy that minimizes active power curtailment and use of reactive power of the photovoltaic inverters, while maintaining voltage stability. Optimized global control outperforms every other local control evaluated in terms of apparent energy used for control (9.9% less usage compared to the second best alternative in all scenarios studied) and ranks second in terms of voltage stability (with a 0.14% of total time outside the voltage limits). Two new indicators to compare control strategies are proposed, and optimized global control strategy ranks best for both efficiency index (0.98) and average apparent power use (0.48 kVA).",

We used an Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) known as UMDA(G) to find the tuple that best reproduces the experimental polarization curve. We tackled non-derivable objective functions to perform robust parameter estimation. We compared the sum of the squared error with published results, and the sum and the median of the absolute error values were used to diminish or remove the effect of possible noise or outliers. Since the UMDA(G) requires a single user-given parameter (the population size) and presents a natural reduction of the variance, it was possible to introduce a variance-based stopping criterion. The obtained results were compared with the most up-to-date evolutionary algorithms, demonstrating that this proposal is competitive. We used four previously reported experimental datasets to get the parameters or validate them. Two of them were used to test the method and to compare it with reported results of recent bio-inspired metaheuristics. Then, we used the identified parameters to simulate the cases of the remaining data sets validating the correct estimation. Finally, we introduced a posterior statistical analysis (hypothesis test), which provided further information about dependencies and the impact of each parameter on the cell performance.

Compared to cloud computing, fog computing nodes are closer to data resource for decreasing the end-to-end transmission latency. Considering the limited resource of IoT devices, offloading computationally-intensive tasks to the servers with high computing capability is essential in the IoT-fog-cloud system to complete those tasks on time. In this work, we propose a fuzzy logical offloading strategy for IoT applications characterized by uncertain parameters to optimize both agreement index and robustness. A multi-objective Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) is designed to learn and optimize the fuzzy offloading strategy from a diversity of the applications. The algorithm partitions applications into independent clusters, so that each cluster can be allocated to the corresponding tier for further processing. Thus, system resources are saved by making scheduling decisions in a reduced search space. Simulation studies on benchmark problems and real-world cases are carried out to verify the efficiency of our proposed algorithm. Pareto sets produced by our algorithm outperformed classic heuristic solutions for 88.3% benchmark cases and dominated Pareto sets of two state-of-art multi-objective algorithms for 92.7% and 94.4% cases correspondingly.

This problem is character-ized by multiple stages with non-identical parallel units and operate based on customer orders. In this paper, we focus on the large scale MMSP and treat the minimization of make-span as the objective function. An efficient cooperative hybrid evolutionary algorithm is proposed based on the framework of cooperative co-evolution. First, a novel two-line encoding scheme is developed to represent the unit assignment and sequencing for orders respectively. Second, modified estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) and differential evolutionary (DE) operations are proposed according to the feature of MMSP. EDA operation with a novel population-based incremental learning strategy is applied to handle the unit assignment variables. And novel DE operation based on a novel encoding method is adopted to deal with sequence variables. Then, two selection strategies are applied to preserve optimal and sub-optimal solutions for the proposed algorithm. The critical path based local search algorithm is adopted to further improve the efficiency of local optimization. The proposed algorithm has been tested by several instances with different sizes and characteristics. The numerical results and comparisons show that the proposed work is very competitive in solving large scale MMSP. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

However, preemption is not uncommon in project management practice and existing studies already show that it is beneficial to consider preemption when leveling resource usage. Therefore, we investigate the preemptive resource leveling problem and design a genetic estimation of distribution algorithm (GEDA). To analyze the performance of the GEDA, we conduct extensively computational experiments on 2160 randomly generated instances. We also examine the impacts of various factors on the GEDA.

        "description": "Light pollution is often measured by a photometric sensor network distributed in the area of interest. However, photometric sensors usually have a narrow view angle, making difficult to perform measurements at low elevation angles. Furthermore, short-term variations are not significant; hence, a low-cost solution is to displace a portable device, able to scan the sky in a range of azimuth and zenith angles, to different locations of interest. The device should be designed with the aim of characterizing the emission function from ground based light sources, which is decreasing in intensity with respect to the zenith. In this manuscript, we propose to find the dimensions of a four-bar linkage mechanism that best fits the scanning task via an optimization problem, solved with an estimation of distribution algorithm. The optimization algorithm proposes configurations with different lengths and reference positions of four-bar linkage mechanisms; then, it measures the distance between points in the actual path and points in the desired path for each configuration. The objective function value is the sum of such distances; thus, the optimal design produces the minimum distance to the desired path. This proposal for automated design reduces the working time and experience requirements of a human designer, and trial-and-error design intends, by determining adequate dimensions for the mechatronic system. A CAD model and a simulation demonstrate the design feasibility and the high accuracy of the resulting device.",

        "description": "Urban growth modelling is a current trend in geocomputation due to its impact on the local living environment and the quality of life. The FUTure Urban-Regional Environment Simulation (FUTURES) model produces projections of landscape patterns by coupling land suitability, per-capita demand, and patch growing algorithm (PGA) sub-models. In particular, the PGA is the urban growing simulator component that takes into account the stochastic nature of urban development. It requires a set of parameters, namely compactness mean, compactness range, and discount factor to approximate the general characteristics of the urban development structure. The fitness of the parameters is measured by computing the difference between the area and compactness histograms of the observed and simulated urban growths. On the one hand, the authors find these parameters via an exhaustive grid search; nevertheless, this requires evaluating all the points in the grid, which implies a high computational cost because each point is associated with several PGA simulations. In addition, the approximation is limited to be one of the points in the grid. Thus, the better the precision is, the higher the required computational cost. On the other hand, evolutionary algorithms have been widely used for the automatic calibration of parameters but, in general, they are not designed to use a low number of evaluations, require expert tuning, and to define the stop criteria. Therefore, we propose an algorithm to find the adequate parameters, with minimum expert intervention, using an Estimation of Distribution Algorithm designed to use a low number of function evaluations (EDALNFE) when compared to the grid search. EDALNFE provides several assets: it delivers competitive results, it requires a low number of function evaluations, it does not require expert settings, and it is equipped with an automatic stop criterion. The proposed algorithm is compared to exhaustive grid search (the only method readily available in the FUTURES package) and differential evolution to demonstrate its superior performance.",

The question of neural network design thus increases in importance, as traditional empirical approaches are reaching their limits. Manual design of network architectures from scratch relies heavily on trial and error, while using existing pretrained models can introduce redundancies or vulnerabilities. Automated neural architecture design is able to overcome these problems, but the most successful algorithms operate on significantly constrained design spaces, assuming the target network to consist of identical repeating blocks. While such approach allows for faster search, it does so at the cost of expressivity. We instead propose an alternative probabilistic representation of a whole neural network structure under the assumption of independence between layer types. Our matrix of probabilities is equivalent to the population of models, but allows for discovery of structural irregularities, while being simple to interpret and analyze. We construct an architecture search algorithm, inspired by the estimation of distribution algorithms, to take advantage of this representation. The probability matrix is tuned towards generating high-performance models by repeatedly sampling the architectures and evaluating the corresponding networks, while gradually increasing the model depth. Our algorithm is shown to discover non-regular models which cannot be expressed via blocks, but are competitive both in accuracy and computational cost, while not utilizing complex dataflows or advanced training techniques, as well as remaining conceptually simple and highly extensible.",

        "description": "In the first and so far only mathematical runtime analysis of an estimation-of-distribution algorithm (EDA) on a multimodal problem, Hasenohrl and Sutton (GECCO 2018) showed for any k = o(n) that the compact genetic algorithm (cGA) with any hypothetical population size mu = Omega(ne(4k) + n(3.5+epsilon)) with high probability finds the optimum of the n-dimensional jump function with jump size k in time O(mu n(1.5) log n). We significantly improve this result for small jump sizes k &lt;= 1/20 ln n - 1. In this case, already for mu = Omega(root n log n) boolean AND poly (n) the runtime of the cGA with high probability is only O(mu root n). For the smallest admissible values of mu, our result gives a runtime of O(n log n), whereas the previous one only shows O(n(5+epsilon)). Since it is known that the cGA with high probability needs at least Omega(mu root n) iterations to optimize the unimodal ONEMAX function, our result shows that the cGA in contrast to most classic evolutionary algorithms here is able to cross moderate-sized valleys of low fitness at no extra cost. For large k, we show that the exponential (in k) runtime guarantee of Hasenohrl and Sutton is tight and cannot be improved, also not by using a smaller hypothetical population size. We prove that any choice of the hypothetical population size leads to a runtime that, with high probability, is at least exponential in the jump size k. This result might be the first non-trivial exponential lower bound for EDAs that holds for arbitrary parameter settings. To complete the picture, we show that the cGA with hypothetical population size mu = Omega(log n) with high probability needs Omega(mu root n + n log n) iterations to optimize any n-dimensional jump function. This bound was known for ONEMAX, but, as we also show, the usual domination arguments do not allow to extend lower bounds on the performance of the cGA on ONEMAX to arbitrary functions with unique optimum. As a side result, we provide a simple general method based on parallel runs that, under mild conditions, (1) overcomes the need to specify a suitable population size and still gives a performance close to the one stemming from the best-possible population size, and (2) transforms EDAs with high-probability performance guarantees into EDAs with similar bounds on the expected runtime.",

        "description": "A new estimation of distribution algorithm based on normalized mutual information (NMIEDA) is proposed for overcoming the premature convergence of bivariate estimation of distribution algorithms. NMIEDA first uses normalized mutual information to measure the interaction between two variables and then generate a dependency forest model. Second, based on the concept of sporadic model building and a reward and punishment scheme in Selfish Gene, NMIEDA provides a new updating mechanism that accelerates the convergence speed. Finally, a new sampling mechanism is adopted in NMIEDA to improve the efficiency of sampling, which combines stochastic sampling, the opposition-based learning scheme and the mutation operator. The simulation results on benchmark problems and real-world problems demonstrate that NMIEDA often outperforms several other bivariate algorithms.",

        "description": "In modern day communication systems, the massive MIMO architecture plays a pivotal role in enhancing the spatial multiplexing gain, but vice versa the system energy efficiency is compromised. Consequently, resource allocation in-terms of antenna selection becomes inevitable to increase energy efficiency without having any obvious effect or compromising the system spectral efficiency. Optimal antenna selection can be performed using exhaustive search. However, for a massive MIMO architecture, exhaustive search is not a feasible option due to the exponential growth in computational complexity with an increase in the number of antennas. We have proposed a computationally efficient and optimum algorithm based on the probability distribution learning for transmit antenna selection. An estimation of the distribution algorithm is a learning algorithm which learns from the probability distribution of best possible solutions. The proposed solution is computationally efficient and can obtain an optimum solution for the real time antenna selection problem. Since precoding and beamforming are also considered essential techniques to combat path loss incurred due to high frequency communications, so after antenna selection, successive interference cancellation algorithm is adopted for precoding with selected antennas. Simulation results verify that the proposed joint antenna selection and precoding solution is computationally efficient and near optimal in terms of spectral efficiency with respect to exhaustive search scheme. Furthermore, the energy efficiency of the system is also optimized by the proposed algorithm, resulting in performance enhancement of massive MIMO systems.",

Many real-world problems such as printed circuit board design, facility location problems, assigning gates to airplanes can be modelled as QAP. Problems of size greater than 35 is not able to solve optimally using conventional optimization methods. This warrants the use of evolutionary optimization methods for obtaining optimal or near optimal solutions for QAPs. This work proposes a hybridization on a univariate Estimation of Distribution Algorithm, namely the Population Based Incremental Learning Algorithm (PBILA), with Variable Neighbourhood Search (VNS) for solving QAPs. The proposed algorithm is employed to solve benchmark instances of QAP and the results are reported. The results of this work reveals that PBILA on its own is not efficient for solving the QAPs. However, when hybridised with VNS, the algorithm performs well providing best known solutions for 95 test instances out of the 101 instances considered. For most of the test instances, the percentage deviation is less than one percentage. The overall average percentage deviation of the obtained solutions from the best-known solutions is 0.037%, which is a significant improvement when compared with state-of-the-art algorithms.",

The robotic assembly line balancing (RALB) problem aims to balance the workloads among different workstations and optimize the assembly line efficiency.

To solve the problem, we present an effective hybrid algorithm fusing the estimation of distribution algorithm and branch-and-bound (B&amp;B) based knowledge. A problem-specific probability model is designed to describe the probabilities of each task being assigned to different workstations. Based on the probability model, an incremental learning method is developed and a sampling mechanism with B&amp;B based knowledge is proposed to generate new feasible solutions. The fuse of B&amp;B based knowledge is able to reduce the search space of EDA while focusing the search on the promising area. To enhance the exploitation ability, a problem-specific local search is developed based on the critical workstation to further improve the quality of elite solutions. The computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is analyzed, and the effectiveness of the B&amp;B based knowledge and the problem-specific local search is demonstrated through numerical experiments.

For the UMDA, the currently known expected runtime on the function is O(n lambda log lambda + n(2)) under an offspring population size lambda = Omega(log n) and a parent population size mu <= lambda/(e(1 + delta)) for any constant delta > 0 (Dang and Lehre, GECCO 2015). There is no lower bound on the expected runtime under the same parameter settings. It also remains unknown whether the algorithm can still optimise the LeadingOnes function within a polynomial runtime when mu >= lambda/(e(1+delta)). In case of the PBIL, an expected runtime of O(n(2+c)) holds for some constant c is an element of(0,1) (Wu, Kolonko and Mohring, IEEE TEVC 2017). Despite being a generalisation of the UMDA, this upper bound is significantly asymptotically looser than the upper bound of O(n(2) of the UMDA for lambda=Omega(log n) boolean AND O. Furthermore, the required population size is very large, i.e., lambda=Omega(n(1+c)). Our contributions are then threefold: (1) we show that the UMDA with mu=Omega(log n) and lambda <= mu e(1-epsilon)/(1+delta) for any constants epsilon is an element of(0,1) and 0 < delta <= e(1-epsilon)-1 requires an expected runtime of e(Omega(mu)) on LEADINGONES, (2) an upper bound of O(n lambda log lambda + n(2)) is shown for the PBIL, which improves the current bound O(n(2+c)) by a significant factor of Theta(n(c)), and (3) we for the first time consider the two algorithms on the LeadingOnes function in a noisy environment and obtain an expected runtime of O(n(2)) for appropriate parameter settings.

We study the intricate dynamics of the cGA on the test function OneMax, and how its performance depends on the hypothetical population size K, which determines how quickly decisions about promising bit values are fixated in the probabilistic model. It is known that the cGA and the Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm (UMDA), a related algorithm whose population size is called lambda, run in expected time O(nlogn) when the population size is just large enough (K=Theta(nlogn) and lambda=Theta(nlogn) , respectively) to avoid wrong decisions being fixated. The UMDA also shows the same performance in a very different regime (lambda=Theta(logn), equivalent to K=Theta(logn) in the cGA) with much smaller population size, but for very different reasons: many wrong decisions are fixated initially, but then reverted efficiently. If the population size is even smaller (o(logn)), the time is exponential. We show that population sizes in between the two optimal regimes are worse as they yield larger runtimes: we prove a lower bound of omega(K1/3n+nlogn) for the cGA on OneMax for K=O(n/log2n). For K=omega(log3n) the runtime increases with growing K before dropping again to O(Kn+nlogn) for K=omega(nlogn) .

        "description": "We perform rigorous runtime analyses for the univariate marginal distribution algorithm (UMDA) and the population-based incremental learning (PBIL) Algorithm on LeadingOnes. For the UMDA, the currently known expected runtime on the function is O(n lambda log lambda + n(2)) under an offspring population size lambda = Omega(log n) and a parent population size mu <= lambda/(e(1 + delta)) for any constant delta > 0 (Dang and Lehre, GECCO 2015). There is no lower bound on the expected runtime under the same parameter settings. It also remains unknown whether the algorithm can still optimise the LeadingOnes function within a polynomial runtime when mu >= lambda/(e(1+delta)). In case of the PBIL, an expected runtime of O(n(2+c)) holds for some constant c is an element of(0,1) (Wu, Kolonko and Mohring, IEEE TEVC 2017). Despite being a generalisation of the UMDA, this upper bound is significantly asymptotically looser than the upper bound of O(n(2) of the UMDA for lambda=Omega(log n) boolean AND O. Furthermore, the required population size is very large, i.e., lambda=Omega(n(1+c)). Our contributions are then threefold: (1) we show that the UMDA with mu=Omega(log n) and lambda <= mu e(1-epsilon)/(1+delta) for any constants epsilon is an element of(0,1) and 0 < delta <= e(1-epsilon)-1 requires an expected runtime of e(Omega(mu)) on LEADINGONES, (2) an upper bound of O(n lambda log lambda + n(2)) is shown for the PBIL, which improves the current bound O(n(2+c)) by a significant factor of Theta(n(c)), and (3) we for the first time consider the two algorithms on the LeadingOnes function in a noisy environment and obtain an expected runtime of O(n(2)) for appropriate parameter settings. Our results emphasise that despite the independence assumption in the probabilistic models, the UMDA and the PBIL with fine-tuned parameter choices can still cope very well with variable interactions.",

        "description": "Due to the constant increase and versatility of IoT devices that should keep sensitive information private, Side-channel Analysis (SCA) attacks on embedded devices are gaining visibility in the industrial field. The integration and validation of countermeasures against SCA can be an expensive and cumbersome process, especially for the less experienced ones. Additionally, current certification procedures require to attack the devices under test using multiple SCA techniques and attack vectors, often implying a high degree of complexity. The goal of this paper is to introduce a new automatic way to ease one of the most crucial and tedious steps of profiling attacks i.e. the points of interest (POI) selection and hence assist the SCA evaluation process. To this end, we propose the usage of Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) in the SCA field to perform the point of interest selection step together with the profiling and key recovery steps. This contribution allows an automated optimization of the attack, avoiding the need to manually perform various types of analyses with different POI combinations. We showcase our approach on several experimental use cases, including attacks on unprotected and protected AES implementations. In addition, we introduce a new public dataset containing power traces taken from distinct copies of the same device and perform attacks over this dataset using our method, dismissing in this way the portability issue.",

        "description": "Expensive black-box combinatorial optimization problems arise in practice when the objective function is evaluated by means of a simulator or a real-world experiment. Since each fitness evaluation is expensive in terms of time or resources, the number of possible evaluations is typically several orders of magnitude smaller than in non-expensive problems. Classical optimization methods are not useful in this scenario. In this paper, we propose and analyze UMM, an estimation-of-distribution (EDA) algorithm based on a Mallows probabilistic model and unbalanced rank aggregation (uBorda). Experimental results on black-box versions of LOP and PFSP show that UMM outperforms the solutions obtained by CEGO, a Bayesian optimization algorithm for combinatorial optimization. Nevertheless, a slight modification to CEGO, based on the different interpretations for rankings and orderings, significantly improves its performance, thus producing solutions that are slightly better than those of UMM and dramatically better than the original version. Another benefit of UMM is that its computational complexity increases linearly with both the number of function evaluations and the permutation size, which results in computation times an order of magnitude shorter than CEGO, making it specially useful when both computation time and number of evaluations are limited.",

        "description": "The compact Genetic Algorithm (cGA) evolves a probability distribution favoring optimal solutions in the underlying search space by repeatedly sampling from the distribution and updating it according to promising samples. We study the intricate dynamics of the cGA on the test function OneMax, and how its performance depends on the hypothetical population size K, which determines how quickly decisions about promising bit values are fixated in the probabilistic model. It is known that the cGA and the Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm (UMDA), a related algorithm whose population size is called lambda, run in expected time O(nlogn) when the population size is just large enough (K=Theta(nlogn) and lambda=Theta(nlogn) , respectively) to avoid wrong decisions being fixated. The UMDA also shows the same performance in a very different regime (lambda=Theta(logn), equivalent to K=Theta(logn) in the cGA) with much smaller population size, but for very different reasons: many wrong decisions are fixated initially, but then reverted efficiently. If the population size is even smaller (o(logn)), the time is exponential. We show that population sizes in between the two optimal regimes are worse as they yield larger runtimes: we prove a lower bound of omega(K1/3n+nlogn) for the cGA on OneMax for K=O(n/log2n). For K=omega(log3n) the runtime increases with growing K before dropping again to O(Kn+nlogn) for K=omega(nlogn) . This suggests that the expected runtime for the cGA is a bimodal function in K with two very different optimal regions and worse performance in between.",
