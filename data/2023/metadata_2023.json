        "description": "Evaluating side-channel analysis (SCA) security is a complex process, involving applying several techniques whose success depends on human engineering. Therefore, it is crucial to avoid a false sense of confidence provided by non-optimal (failing) attacks. Different alternatives have emerged lately trying to mitigate human dependency, among which deep learning (DL) attacks are the most studied today. DL promise to simplify the procedure by e.g. evading the need for point of interest (POI) selection, among other shortcuts. However, including DL in the equation comes at a price, since working with neural networks is not straightforward in this context. Recently, an alternative has appeared with the potential to mitigate this dependence without adding extra complexity: estimation of distribution algorithm-based SCA. From the perspective of avoiding the need for POI selection, in this paper we provide a comparison of the two relevant methods. Our findings are supported by experimental results on various datasets.",

        "description": "An estimation-of-distribution algorithm is an evolutionary algorithm that uses a probabilistic model to represent its population. It iteratively draws solutions from its model and, considering their fitnesses, uses these solutions to update the model's parameters. However, there is a risk of reinforcing random noise from sampling back into the model-a problem termed genetic drift. We propose the competing genes evolutionary algorithm that optimizes a fitness function over a binary search space and avoids this problem by updating only one model parameter at a time. The algorithm uses the model not only to sample solutions but also to select a parameter in each iteration that it pins to a value for the rest of the search process. We obtain upper bounds on the number of fitness evaluations the algorithm needs to solve well-known benchmark functions as a function of its population size and observe better or comparable results to other evolutionary algorithms. We attribute these favorable results to the algorithm's efficient use of its samples to explore its dwindling search space. We also introduce two variants of the algorithm. The first version eliminates the need to preset the number of solutions to sample per iteration, and the second seeks to escape local optima. We provide evidence that these variants achieve their goals.",

In this work, we argue that the purely academic question of what could be the best possible algorithm in a certain broad class of black-box optimizers can give fruitful indications in which direction to search for good established heuristics. We demonstrate this approach on the recently proposed DLB benchmark. Our finding that the unary unbiased black-box complexity is only O (n2) suggests the Metropolis algorithm as an interesting candidate and we prove that it solves the DLB problem in quadratic time. We also prove that better runtimes cannot be obtained in the class of unary unbiased algorithms. We therefore shift our attention to algorithms that use the information of more parents to generate new solutions and find that the significance-based compact genetic algorithm can solve the DLB problem in time O (n log n).(c) 2023 The Author(s).

Considering the affection of these uncertain parameters on system performance, dynamic process optimization of the fermentation system can be modeled as a distributionally robust discrete control problem under moment uncertainty, which aims to maximize the mean productivity by optimizing the discrete-valued dilution rate function. Based on duality theory, the established min-max discrete optimal control problem is first transformed into a single level minimization problem, which is then discretized into a large-scale parameter optimization problem with semi-infinite constraint via time transformation and control parameterization. A new two-step estimation of distribution algorithm is developed to solve the obtained large-scale optimization problem. Numerical results show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed solution approach together with the superiority of the obtained control strategy considering parameter uncertainties.",

        "description": "Explaining the decisions made by population-based metaheuristics can often be considered difficult due to the stochastic nature of the mechanisms employed by these optimisation methods. As industries continue to adopt these methods in areas that increasingly require end-user input and confirmation, the need to explain the internal decisions being made has grown. In this article, we present our approach to the extraction of explanation supporting features using trajectory mining. This is achieved through the application of principal components analysis techniques to identify new methods of tracking population diversity changes post-runtime. The algorithm search trajectories were generated by solving a set of benchmark problems with a genetic algorithm and a univariate estimation of distribution algorithm and retaining all visited candidate solutions which were then projected to a lower dimensional sub-space. We also varied the selection pressure placed on high fitness solutions by altering the selection operators. Our results show that metrics derived from the projected sub-space algorithm search trajectories are capable of capturing key learning steps and how solution variable patterns that explain the fitness function may be captured in the principal component coefficients. A comparative study of variable importance rankings derived from a surrogate model built on the same dataset was also performed. The results show that both approaches are capable of identifying key features regarding variable interactions and their influence on fitness in a complimentary fashion.",

In particular, in the proposed TSEDA, a new probability model and its updating mechanism are presented, and a two-stage coevolution strategy with some novel heuristic methods for individual generation, decoding and improvement is designed.

        "description": "In recent years, renewable energy (RE) has been widely deployed, and the power system with high penetration RE is gradually formed. However, the high proportion of RE may threaten transmission security of power systems, which in turn limits its utilization. What is more, the interaction between RE penetration and power system transmission security has not been comprehensively investigated so far. To this end, we develop a bi-objective stochastic dispatch model to investigate the relationship between RE utilization and transmission security. It aims to solve the optimal power system dispatch (OPSD) problem with high penetration RE, in which the RE curtailment and the capacity margin of transmission lines are considered as two objectives of the dispatch problem and formulated in the probabilistic forms. With this, the proposed model is a complicated bi-objective stochastic optimization problem, which is difficult to be solved for traditional optimization algorithms. Therefore, we propose a data-driven Bayesian assisted optimization (DBAO) algorithm, based on Bayesian evolutionary optimization and estimation of distribution algorithm to improve the searching efficiency for the proposed model. Case studies on a modified Midwestern US power system verify the effectiveness of our proposed dispatch model and the optimization algorithm of DBAO.",

Firstly, taking the evaluation information of a few individuals as training data, a similarity evaluation method between decision variables is proposed. Following that, a preference probability model is built to estimate the distribution probability of decision variables. Then, the preference utility function of individuals is defined based on the similarity of decision variables. Finally, the surrogate-assisted fitness evaluation is realized by optimizing the weight of the decision variables' similarities. The above strategies are incorporated into the interactive estimation of the distribution algorithm framework and applied to address the optimal product design problem and the indoor lighting optimization problem. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the comparative method in terms of search efficiency and fitness prediction accuracy.",

Shortly before the tapping of molten steel from the basic oxygen furnace (BOF), end-point control measures are applied to achieve the required final molten steel quality. While it is difficult to build an exact mathematical model for this process, the control inputs and the corresponding outputs are available by collecting production data. We build a data-driven model for the process. To optimize the control parameters, an improved estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) is developed using a probabilistic model comprising different distributions. A resampling mechanism is incorporated into the EDA to guide the new population to a broader and more promising area when the search becomes ineffective. To further enhance the solution quality, we add a local improvement to update the current best individual through simplified gravitational search and information learning. Experiments are conducted using real data from a BOF steelmaking process. The results show that the algorithm can help to achieve the specified molten steel quality. To evaluate the proposed algorithm as a general optimization algorithm, we test it on some complex benchmark functions. The results illustrate that it outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms across a wide range of problems.",

        "description": "The flexible job-shop co-scheduling problem (FJCSP) for processing machines and automated guided vehicles (AGVs) in a flexible manufacturing system (FMS) has attracted more attention with the aim of improving production efficiency. In FMS, AGVs in charge of transporting jobs realize the flexible linkage of operations between different processing machines. The added interdependence between transporting and processing tasks brings more difficulties than the traditional flexible job-shop scheduling problem (FJSP). In this paper, the mathematical model of FJCSP is formulated to minimize the makespan. Considering the feature similarity of FJCSP with FJSP and AGV-routing problem in different cases, a multi-view modeling-based hybrid algorithm consisting of an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) and an ant colony optimization (ACO) is proposed. In EDA, a probability model abstracts the information in superior solutions about the operation sequencing and the rule selection for scheduling machines and AGVs. In ACO, a jobpath pheromone model and an AGV-path pheromone model are designed to jointly select the job-machine-AGV combination with shorter processing time and transportation time. In the proposed hybrid algorithm, EDA and ACO generate solutions indepen- dently and achieve cooperation by sharing elites. An adaptive parameter is designed to regulate the use of the two methods to adapt to the varying demands of multi-view modeling in different cases and search stages. Furthermore, a local search with a three-layer operator based on the critical path method is proposed to balance exploration and exploitation in solution space. Finally, computational experiments involving a case study verified the advantage of the multi-view modeling-based hybrid algorithm in comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches.",

With the consideration of some real-world constraints, especially the cardinality constraints, the problem becomes much more challenging as it converts to a mixed-integer quadratic multi-objective optimization problem.

First, a hybrid design of Ant colony optimization (ACO) and Estimation distribution algorithm (EDA) is used to solve this mixed-variable optimization problem based on knowledge information. Second, a knowledge accumulation mechanism is designed to discover the internal relationship among the assets. The mechanism can not only guide the selection of assets effectively but also enable the use of historical information during evolution to direct the allocation of investment proportion. Third, a constructive approach is applied to construct portfolios under the constraints.

Each generation of EDAs builds a probabilistic model to represent the most promising individuals, and the next generation is created by sampling from this model. The primary challenge in designing such algorithms lies in effectively constructing the probabilistic model. The mutual exclusivity constraint imposes an additional challenge for EDAs to approach permutation-based problems. In this study, we propose a new EDA called Position-Guided Sampling Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (PGS-EDA) specifically designed for permutation-based problems. Unlike conventional approaches, our algorithm focuses on the positions rather than the elements during the sampling phase. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm on the Permutation Flow-shop Scheduling Problem (PFSP). The experiments conducted on various sizes of Taillard instances provide evidence of the effectiveness of our algorithm in addressing the PFSP, particularly for small and medium-sized problems. The comparison results with other EDAs designed to handle permutation problems demonstrate that our PSG-EDA algorithm consistently achieves the lowest Average Relative Percentage Deviation (ARPD) values in 19 out of the 30 instances of sizes 20 and 50 used in the study.

On the other hand, numerical simulation can be used to test the cell's design and boost its performance but requires a set of physical parameters. In this proposal, we introduce a novel modification to an empirical model for a Direct Methanol Fuel Cell to make it suitable for DEFC simulations at different temperatures by a new semi-empirical mathematical model. In addition, we introduce temperature-depending parametric forms of several terms to reduce the number of possible parameters to estimate from the DEFC. Then, we combined the models with an estimation of distribution algorithm to find the numerical simulation that best reproduces the experimental polarization curve. The method is validated by estimating the parameters to reproduce the experimental data at different temperatures reported in the literature, and with data obtained in an in-house open-cathode DEFC, recorded at a scan rate of 10 mVs-1, using as fuel CH3CH2OH 1 M at 25 degrees C and 60 degrees C. From the estimation results at temperature set T \u20d71 = (T1a, T1c) degrees C, the same parameters are used for a simulation at T2 \u20d7 = (T2a, T2c) degrees C, demonstrating that it reproduces the two experimental polarization curves.

        "description": "In order to accurately predict the possible gas emission quantity in coal mines, it is proposed to use the multi-thread calculation of the Immune Genetic Algorithm (IGA) and injection of vaccines to improve the accuracy of prediction and combine the Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) to the distribution probability of excellent populations. Calculating, and selecting excellent populations for iteration, optimize the population generation process of the Immune Genetic Algorithm, so that the population quality is continuously optimized and improved, and the optimal solution is obtained, thereby establishing a gas emission quantity prediction model based on the Immune Genetic Algorithm and Estimation of Distribution Algorithm. Using the 9136 mining face with gas emission hazards in a coal mine from Shandong Province in China as the prediction object, the absolute gas emission quantity is used to scale the gas emission quantity, and it is found that the model can accurately predict the gas emission quantity, which is consistent with the on-site emission unanimous. In the prediction comparison with IGA, it is found that the accuracy of the prediction results has increased by 9.51%, and the number of iterations to achieve the required goal has been reduced by 67%, indicating that the EDA has a better role in optimizing the population update process such as genetic selection of the IGA. Comparing the prediction results of other models, it is found that the prediction accuracy of the EDA-IGA is 94.93%, which is the highest prediction accuracy, indicating that this prediction model can be used as a new method for the prediction of coal mine gas emission. Accurately predicting the gas emission quantity can provide guidance for safe mining in coal mines. The gas emission quantity can also be used as a safety indicator to reduce the possibility of coal mine accidents, ensure the personal safety of coal miners and reduce economic losses in coal mines.",

        "description": "In the development of a software product, the Next Release Problem is the selection of the most appropriate subset of requirements (tasks) to include in the next release of the product, such that the selected subset maximises the overall satisfaction of the stakeholders and minimises the total cost. Furthermore, in most cases, requirements or tasks cannot be developed independently, as there are dependencies between them, which must be respected in the selection for the next release. In this paper, we approach the Next Release Problem as a constrained bi-objective optimisation problem. The main contribution is the design of an Estimation of Distribution Algorithm that exploits domain knowledge, i.e. the dependencies between the requirements, to define the structure of a Bayesian network that models the relationships between the binary variables (requirements) to be optimised. The use of a Bayesian network with a fixed structure reduces the complexity of the search process, since it is unnecessary to learn the structure at each iteration of the algorithm. Moreover, it ensures that the sampled individuals are always valid with respect to the required dependencies. The second main contribution is the generation of a corpus of synthetic datasets with cost estimations derived from agile and classic management methodologies. Standard multi-objective metrics are computed in order to assess our proposal and compare it with other evolutionary multi-criterion optimisation algorithms, determining that it is the optimal choice when dealing with complex datasets.",

Meanwhile, it is considerably challenging to achieve explainable solution as well as significant performance due to computation complexity and variable diversity. To efficaciously handle the difficulty, this paper presents a novel metaheuristic-based time series clustering method which can improve the effectiveness and logicality of existing clustering approaches. The proposed method collects candidate cluster references from hierarchical and partitional clustering through shape-based distance measure as well as dynamic time warping (DTW) on manufacturing time series data. By applying metaheuristics highlighting estimation of distribution algorithms (EDA), such as extended compact genetic algorithm (ECGA), on the collected candidate clusters, advanced cluster centroid combinations with minimal distances can be achieved. ECGA employs the least complicated and the most closely related probabilistic model structure regarding population space during generation cycle. This feature strengthens the comprehension of clustering results in how such optimal solutions were achieved. The proposed method was tested on real-world time series data, open to the public, from manufacturing industry, and showed noticeable performances compared to well-established methods. Accordingly, this paper demonstrates that obtaining both comprehensible result as well as prominent performance is feasible by employing metaheuristic techniques to time series data clustering methods.",

In this problem we have to pack a set of rectangles into two-dimensional variable-sized rectangular bins. The bins are divided into types, and the bins in different types have different sizes and possibly different weights (costs). There are (sufficiently) many bins from each type, and any rectangle fits into at least one bin-type. The goal is to pack the rectangles into the bins without overlap, parallel to the sides, so that the total area of the used bins (or total cost) is minimized. Our algorithm is a hybrid heuristic. It uses two different techniques to generate the descendants: either estimation of distribution algorithm and sampling the resulting probability model, or applying the usual operators of evolutionary algorithms (selection, mutation). To pack the rectangles into the bins the algorithm uses the strategy of randomly choosing one of two placement heuristics, that pack always only one group (one to three) of rectangles. It improves the quality of the solutions with three local search procedures. The algorithm has been tested on benchmark instances from the literature and has been compared with other heuristics and metaheuristics. Our algorithm outperformed the previously published results.",

        "description": "Web service composition composes existing Web services to accommodate users' requests for required functionalities with the best possible quality of services (QoS). Due to the computational complexity of this problem, evolutionary computation (EC) techniques have been employed to efficiently find composite services with near-optimal functional quality (i.e., quality of semantic matchmaking, QoSM for short) or nonfunctional quality (i.e., QoS) for each composition request individually. With a rapid increase in composition requests from a growing number of users, solving one composition request at a time can hardly meet the efficiency target anymore. Driven by the idea that the solutions obtained from solving one request can be highly useful for tackling other related requests, multitasking service composition approaches have been proposed to efficiently deal with multiple composition requests concurrently. However, existing attempts have not been effective in learning and sharing knowledge among solutions for multiple requests. In this article, we model the problem of collectively handling multiple service composition requests as a new multitasking service composition problem and propose a new permutation-based multifactorial evolutionary algorithm based on an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA), named PMFEA-EDA, to effectively and efficiently solve this problem. In particular, we introduce a novel method for effective knowledge sharing across different service composition requests. For that, we develop a new sampling mechanism to increase the chance of identifying high-quality service compositions in both the single-tasking and multitasking contexts. Our experiment shows that our proposed approach, PMFEA-EDA, takes much less time than existing approaches that process each service request separately, and also outperforms them in terms of both QoSM and QoS.",

To solve the undesirable deadlocks of CMTAP, a Petri net amender is constructed based on a candidate solution, and a deadlock-free solution is equivalent to a feasible transition sequence that can be fired sequentially in the corresponding amender. With this amender, we present a Petri net-based deadlock amending method (PDAM) with polynomial time complexity to convert a deadlocked solution into a deadlock-free solution. Also, a deadlock-free hybrid estimation of distribution algorithm (DHEDA) is developed for CMTAP by embedding PDAM into the original EDA. To further improve the solution quality, we establish a local exploitation method, and an adaptive operational probability is used to balance the computational burden and local exploitation ability. Then, a match-up-based reassignment method is proposed to cope with time-sensitive targets. Finally, extensive computational experiments demonstrate that PDAM is more effective at solving deadlocks than graph-based methods, particularly for large-scale CMTAP, and DHEDA outperforms existing algorithms when solving CMTAP.",

By sampling the distribution population, efficient search in the solution space is realized based on a tabu search process. Meanwhile, DEA-PPM introduces an iterative vertex removal strategy to improve the efficiency of k-coloring, and an inherited initialization strategy is implemented to address the chromatic number problem well. The cooperative evolution of the distribution population and the solution population leads to a good balance between exploration and exploitation.

In CMBO-PG, a Gaussian estimation of distribution algorithm (GEDA), which enhances the exploitation tendency, is utilized to generate the solutions of the leading flock. The neighborhood solutions of the following flock are produced by a multi-strategy learning mechanism to promote exploration capability. The co-evolution of the leading flock and following flock is realized by the information-sharing mechanism and the operation of destruction and construction to keep the balance of exploration and exploitation. The nonlinear selection of mutation strategies is laborious due to the differences in the ability to address optimization problems. In the mechanism of multi-strategy learning, a long short-term memory (LSTM) is adopted as a selector of mutation strategies to predict the selection probability of three mutation strategies. The evolutionary procedure of the following flock is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP). The policy gradient (PG) is employed as a model optimizer to control the parameters of LSTM based on the historical feedback information. The performance of CMBO-PG is testified on the CEC 2017 benchmark test suite.

The repair shop provides repair and maintenance services to its customers. After a major disruption to production, the repair shop faces delays in production and order delivery due to shortages in materials and/or labor, which requires rescheduling of all the unfinished parts. We observe that the finished parts incur high holding costs until the entire order is completed, while any unfinished parts (in the form of raw material or work-in-progress) incur low holding costs until production starts. Moreover, the repair shop incurs a setup cost when switching between different types of parts. Considering these new features, we formulate the rescheduling problem for the repair shop under a coordinated supply chain as an integer program to minimize the total tardiness, setup cost, and holding cost. To solve the model, we propose an innovative two-stage genetic algorithm, which utilizes the estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) to improve the search process of the optimal solution. We test the performance of this algorithm on a dataset generated from the order data of a heavy machinery maintenance provider. The numerical results show that our model generates solutions that outperform the initial schedule, which was obtained by minimizing holding and setup costs without disruption. In addition, using other closely-related genetic algorithms as benchmarks, we show that our algorithm outperforms the benchmarks without sacrificing the computational time.

To overcome this defect, we explore a novel EDA variant with an ensemble of three distribution modification strategies, i.e., archive-based population updating (APU), multileader-based search diversification (MSD), and the triggered distribution shrinkage (TDS) strategy, named E-3-EDA. The APU strategy utilizes historical population information to rebuild the search scope and avoid ill-shaped distributions. Moreover, it continuously updates the archive to avoid overfitting the distribution model. The MSD makes full use of the location differences among populations to evolve the sampling toward promising regions. TDS is triggered when the search stagnates, shrinking the distribution scope to achieve local exploitation.

In particular, we aim to reduce the number of UmBSs required and increase the number of MUs served by optimizing the deployment locations of UmBS. To this end, a three-step UmBS deployment approach is proposed. First, utilize K-means, a machine learning-based clustering technique, for the cluster initialization of the UmBSs deployment locations. Next, to ensure the required Quality of Service at MU, the service radius of each UmBS is estimated based on the minimum signal-to-interference plus noise ratio at each MU. Subsequently, a fuzzy rule-based adaptive genetic algorithm termed FRAT is proposed to reduce the number of UmBSs required and to increase the number of MU served.

To address this issue, an improved RM-MEDA with auto-controllable population diversity (RM-MEDA-AcPD) is suggested in this paper. In RM-MEDA-AcPD, the simplex crossover method is employed to extend the representation range of the affine subspace, the main purpose of which is to push solutions forward along the orthogonal direction of the affine subspace. In addition, a random noise model related to the evolution process is designed to replace the original Gaussian noise model, which reduces the risk of rapid loss of population diversity. In experimental studies, we have compared eight regularity property-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithms with the RM-MEDA-AcPD on benchmark problems with disconnected Pareto fronts.

Based on the estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) and the graph random walk algorithm, the ECSA generates an edge cover queue from DAG. Then, the ECSA uses the heuristics greedy method with low time and computational complexity to allocate the edge cover queue to processors. Theoretical analysis and simulation results on random DAGs and real-world DAGs show that the ECSA can achieve better scheduling results in terms of makespan, the schedule length ratio (SLR), efficiency, and frequency of best results with low time and computational complexity.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

        "description": "Selecting the appropriate requirements to develop in the next release of an open market software product under evolution, is a compulsory step of each software development project. This selection should be done by maximizing stakeholders' satisfaction and minimizing development costs, while keeping constraints. In this work we investigate what is the requirements interactions impact when searching for solutions of the bi-objective Next Release Problem. In one hand, these interactions are explicitly included in two algorithms: a branch and bound algorithm and an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA). And on the other, we study the performance of these not previously used solving approaches by applying them in several instances of small, medium and large size data sets. We find that interactions inclusion do enhance the search and when time restrictions exists, as in the case of the bi-objective Next Release Problem, EDAs have proven to be stable and reliable locating a large number of solutions on the reference Pareto front.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

        "description": "Evolutionary multi-tasking optimization (EMTO) aims to boost the overall efficiency of optimizing multiple tasks by triggering knowledge transfer among them. Unfortunately, it may suffer from negative transfer on heterogeneous composite tasks that have low similarity. Some studies try to learn an intertask alignment transformation based on the paired samples from the involved tasks, but risk a failed alignment with improper pairwise methods. To solve this issue, this study proposes an optimal correspondence assisted affine transformation (OCAT) algorithm. OCAT explicitly constructs a mathematical model for the intertask alignment problem and theoretically deduces its optimal solution in an iterative method. As a result, the sample correspondences that enable the learned transformation to achieve the maximum intertask similarity can be located. Besides, a novel approach to deriving the affine transformation formula is also developed for OCAT. The resulting affine alignment transformation will not impair the knowledge contained in the tasks during the alignment process. By integrating OCAT with the estimation of distribution algorithm, this study finally develops a many-tasking optimization algorithm named MaT-EDA, where the solutions from other tasks are explicitly transferred as the samples for estimating the current distribution model. Extensive simulation studies have indicated that OCAT can significantly enhance the performance of EMTO, and MaT-EDA also achieves impressive many-tasking optimization performance.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

        "description": "In this paper the dynamic performance of Heat-Integrated Distillation Columns (HIDiC) is presented. The dynamic performance was determined for the optimal HIDiC designs optimized previously using a constrained Boltzmann-based estimation of distribution algorithm. Eight close-boiling mixtures, covering a range of relative volatility (alpha) from 1.12 to 2.4, were used as case studies. The dynamic behavior was obtained under open and closed-loop process analysis. The results obtained showed that the HIDiC columns un-dergo worse dynamic performance than their equivalent traditional columns for all case studies. Furthermore, it was notorious that the difference in the dynamic behavior of both configurations kept a relatively uniform trend for most systems. However, a marked dif-ference in the dynamic properties was determined for the mixture close to azeotropic behavior, which experienced a considerably larger control effort.Thus, the novel findings disclosed in this paper show that, although the HIDiC se-quences experienced worse dynamics than the conventional columns, the HIDiC config-urations reached a stable dynamic behavior for all the range of alpha of the mixtures under study. Nevertheless, high control difficulties were particularly determined for the HIDiC configuration used to separate the mixture with alpha close to unity (mixture of xylenes), which in fact is the HIDiC sequence with the best energetic and economic benefits.Hence, the energetic and economic potential of the HIDiC columns is not limited by the dynamic behavior for most case studies analyzed, at least in theoretical terms. However, such potential might be particularly reduced or unharnessed in the separation of the mixture with alpha near the azeotropic behavior due to the dynamics of the HIDiC column for this separation.So, the findings presented in this paper allow to infer that sequential or simultaneous dynamic studies must be achieved along with the optimization of the HIDiC columns to determine the integral performance (energetic, economic and dynamic) of these config-urations.(c) 2023 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

In order to prevent the disease from reaching such an extreme, a timely diagnosis and effective treatment must be applied. Until now, the way to verify the state of the retina has been to make qualitative observations of fundus images, all carried out by an ophthalmological specialist; however, this is totally restricted to their experience, and some changes in the vascular structure of the retina could be omitted, in addition to the fact that very high resolution images would be needed to be able to detect significant changes. Accordingly, with the help of computational tools, this diagnostic/monitoring process can be improved. This paper presents a novel strategy for the modeling of the MTA by using an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) based on the probability density function in order to determine the coefficients and parameters (alpha,beta) of a Jacobi polynomial series. A model using polynomials is the novel aspect of this work since in the literature there are no models of the MTA of this type, in addition to seeking to better cover the profile of the retinal vein. According to the experimental results, the proposed method presents the advantage to achieve superior performance in terms of the mean distance to the closest point (4.34 pixels), and the Hausdorff distance (14.43 pixels) with respect to different state-of-the-art methods of the numerical modeling of the retina, using the DRIVE database of retinal fundus images with a manual delineation of the MTA performed by an specialist.",

Since the traditional multi-objective optimization algorithms tend to fall into local optimum solutions when dealing with optimization problems in three dimensions, we suggest an advanced estimation of distribution algorithm. The main idea of this algorithm is to integrate the adaptive deflation of the selection rate, adaptive evolution of the covariance matrix, comprehensive evaluation of individual convergence and diversity, and reference point-based non-dominated ranking. A multi-UAV path planning model involving multi-objective optimization is established, and the designed algorithm is simulated and compared with other three high-dimensional multi-objective optimization algorithms. The results show that the AEMO-EDA proposed in this paper has stronger convergence and wider population distribution diversity in applying to the multi-UAV cooperative path planning model, as well as better global convergence.

        "description": "The benefits of using crossover in crossing fitness gaps have been studied extensively in evolutionary computation. Recent runtime results show that majority-vote crossover is particularly efficient at optimizing the well-known JUMP benchmark function that includes a fitness gap next to the global optimum. Also estimation-of-distribution algorithms (EDAs), which use an implicit crossover, are much more efficient on JUMP than typical mutation -based algorithms. However, the allowed gap size for polynomial runtimes with EDAs is at most logarithmic in the problem dimension n.In this paper, we investigate variants of the JUMP function where the gap is shifted and appears in the middle of the typical search trajectory. Such gaps can still be overcome efficiently in time O(n log n) by majority-vote crossover and an estimation-of-distribution algorithm, even for gap sizes almost root n. However, if the global optimum is located in the gap instead of the usual all-ones string, majority-vote crossover would nevertheless approach the all-ones string and be highly inefficient. In sharp contrast, an EDA can still find such a shifted optimum efficiently. Thanks to a general property called fair sampling, the EDA will with high probability sample from almost every fitness level of the function, including levels in the gap, and sample the global optimum even though the overall search trajectory points towards the all-ones string. Finally, we derive limits on the gap size allowing efficient runtimes for the EDA.(c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

Firstly, a novel cooperative evolutionary framework is proposed to hybridize LSHADE-RSP, a state-of-the-art DE variant incorporating DE-based effective improvement strategies, with EDA. Secondly, the dominant individuals generated by LSHADE-RSP are used to establish the probability distribution model for EDA to enhance its exploitation in each generation, and a new control parameter is introduced to balance exploitation and exploration. Then, the use of greed strategy works via EDA to fully retain highquality solutions to the next generation to improve the convergence speed. Finally, the greedy strategy is used to shrink the external archive when its size decreases due to the reduction of the population size. A comparison of IDE-EDA with cutting-edge DE-based and EDA-based variants, including AAVS-EDA, EB-LSHADE, ELSHADE-SPACMA, jSO, LSHADE-RSP, RWGEDA, HSES, and APGSK-IMODE, was implemented to verify its efficiency.

In this article, an innovative matrix-cube-based (i.e., 3-D) EDA (MCEDA) is first proposed to minimize the total earliness and tardiness (TET) of the NFSSP with SDSTs and RTs. This problem is NP-hard in the strong sense. First, a 3-D matrix cube is devised to learn the valuable information from promising solutions or excellent individuals. Second, an EDA model or probabilistic model based on the matrix cube and a special sampling method is presented to perform effective exploration in solution space and find promising regions. Third, based on a series of newly defined subneighborhoods, a new local search with both a speed-up scanning method and one search strategy is developed to execute exploitation from promising regions. Fourth, a speed-up evaluation method based on the problem's property is designed to reduce the computational complexity for calculating criterion and accelerate the search process. Owing to the reasonable hybridization of exploration and exploitation, MCEDA can perform very efficient search in solution space. Extensive test results on instances of such a just-in-time problem first show that MCEDA can achieve better solution than state-of-the-art algorithms in obviously less computation time. Additional experiments on instances of various NFSSPs further confirm the efficiency and robustness of MCEDA.",

In the deep Q-network component, 34 state features are selected to describe the scheduling situation, while nine knowledge-based actions are defined to refine the scheduling solution, and the reward based on the two objectives is designed. As the knowledge for initialization and optimization strategies, five properties of the considered problem are proposed. The proposed mixed integer linear programming model of the problem is validated by exact solver CPLEX. The results of the numerical testing on wide-range scale instances show that the proposed hybrid algorithm is efficient and effective at solving the integrated flexible job shop scheduling problem.",

        "authors": "Li, Jian-Yu Zhan, Zhi-Hui Xu, Jin Kwong, Sam Zhang, Jun",
        "description": "The performance of a convolutional neural network (CNN) heavily depends on its hyperparameters. However, finding a suitable hyperparameters configuration is difficult, challenging, and computationally expensive due to three issues, which are 1) the mixed-variable problem of different types of hyperparameters; 2) the large-scale search space of finding optimal hyperparameters; and 3) the expensive computational cost for evaluating candidate hyperparameters configuration. Therefore, this article focuses on these three issues and proposes a novel estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) for efficient hyperparameters optimization, with three major contributions in the algorithm design. First, a hybrid-model EDA is proposed to efficiently deal with the mixed-variable difficulty. The proposed algorithm uses a mixed-variable encoding scheme to encode the mixed-variable hyperparameters and adopts an adaptive hybrid-model learning (AHL) strategy to efficiently optimize the mixed-variables. Second, an orthogonal initialization (OI) strategy is proposed to efficiently deal with the challenge of large-scale search space. Third, a surrogate-assisted multi-level evaluation (SME) method is proposed to reduce the expensive computational cost. Based on the above, the proposed algorithm is named surrogate-assisted hybrid-model EDA (SHEDA). For experimental studies, the proposed SHEDA is verified on widely used classification benchmark problems, and is compared with various state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, a case study on aortic dissection (AD) diagnosis is carried out to evaluate its performance. Experimental results show that the proposed SHEDA is very effective and efficient for hyperparameters optimization, which can find a satisfactory hyperparameters configuration for the CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and AD diagnosis with only 0.58, 0.97, and 1.18 GPU days, respectively.",

Building on a quantitative analysis of how the population size leads to genetic drift, we design a smart-restart mechanism for EDAs. By stopping runs when the risk for genetic drift is high, it automatically runs the EDA in good parameter regimes. Via a mathematical runtime analysis, we prove a general performance guarantee for this smart-restart scheme. For many situations where the optimal parameter values are known, this shows that the restart scheme automatically finds these optimal values, leading to the asymptotically optimal performance. We also conduct an extensive experimental analysis. On four classic benchmarks, the smart-restart scheme leads to a performance close to the one obtainable with optimal parameter values.

        "description": "One particular kind of evolutionary algorithms known as Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) has gained the attention of the aerospace industry for its ability to solve nonlinear and complicated problems, particularly in the optimization of space trajectories during on-orbit operations of satellites. This article describes an effective method for optimizing the trajectory of a spacecraft using an evolutionary approach based on EDAs, incorporated with fitness landscape analysis (FLA). The approach utilizes flexible operators that are paired with seeding and selection mechanisms of EDAs. Initially, the orbit transfer problem is mathematically modeled and the objectives and constraints are identified. The landscape feature of the search space is analyzed via the dispersion metric to measure the modality and ruggedness of the search domain. The obtained information are used as feedback in developing adaptive operators for truncation factor and constraints separation threshold of the employed EDA. A framework for spacecraft trajectory optimization has been presented where the dispersion value for a space mission is estimated using a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm. The suggested method is used to solve several problems related to low-thrust orbit transfer of satellites in Earth's orbit. Results demonstrate that the suggested framework for trajectory design and optimization of space transfers is effective enough to offer fuel-efficient and energy-efficient maneuvers for different thrust levels of the propulsion system. Moreover, the performance of the proposed approach is evaluated against non-adaptive EDA and other advanced evolutionary algorithms. The obtained results certify that the proposed adaptive evolutionary approach is superior in identifying feasible minimum-fuel and minimum-energy transfer trajectories.",

        "description": "Denoising autoencoder genetic programming (DAE-GP) is a novel neural network-based estimation of distribution genetic programming approach that uses denoising autoencoder long short-term memory networks as a probabilistic model to replace the standard mutation and recombination operators of genetic programming. At each generation, the idea is to capture promising properties of the parent population in a probabilistic model and to use corruption to transfer variations of these properties to the offspring. This work studies the influence of corruption and sampling steps on search. Corruption partially mutates candidate solutions that are used as input to the model, whereas the number of sampling steps defines how often we re-use the output during model sampling as input to the model. We study the generalization of the royal tree problem, the Airfoil problem, and the Pagie-1 problem, and find that both corruption strength and the number of sampling steps influence exploration and exploitation in search and affect performance: exploration increases with stronger corruption and lower number of sampling steps. The results indicate that both corruption and sampling steps are key to the success of the DAE-GP: it permits us to balance the exploration and exploitation behavior in search, resulting in an improved search quality. However, also selection is important for exploration and exploitation and should be chosen wisely.",

It offers a highly modular approach for estimating covariance functions of stationary processes. Our method can impose positive definiteness, as well as isotropy and monotonicity, on the estimators, and its hyperparameters can be decided using cross validation. We define our estimators by taking integral transforms of kernel-based distribution surrogates. We then use the iterated density estimation evolutionary algorithm, a variant of estimation of distribution algorithms, to fit the estimators. We also extend our method to estimate covariance functions for point-referenced data. Compared to alternative approaches, our method provides more reliable estimates for long-range dependence.

However, it is very challenging to achieve an optimal subset of features as well as interpretable relationship among features due to computation complexity and variable diversity. In order to address those difficulties, this paper presents a novel evolutionary approach for feature selection algorithm to improve the effectiveness of existing meta-heuristic approaches. In other words, their optimal combinations with minimal difference between prediction and actual values can be achieved by applying an estimation of distribution algorithms (i.e., extended compact genetic algorithm) on the collected candidate feature sets. The approach discovers a less complicated and more closely related probabilistic-model structure on population space in each generation, thereby encouraging the comprehension power of feature selection results.

        "description": "One particular kind of evolutionary algorithms known as Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) has gained the attention of the aerospace industry for its ability to solve nonlinear and complicated problems, particularly in the optimization of space trajectories during on-orbit operations of satellites. This article describes an effective method for optimizing the trajectory of a spacecraft using an evolutionary approach based on EDAs, incorporated with fitness landscape analysis (FLA). The approach utilizes flexible operators that are paired with seeding and selection mechanisms of EDAs. Initially, the orbit transfer problem is mathematically modeled and the objectives and constraints are identified. The landscape feature of the search space is analyzed via the dispersion metric to measure the modality and ruggedness of the search domain. The obtained information are used as feedback in developing adaptive operators for truncation factor and constraints separation threshold of the employed EDA. A framework for spacecraft trajectory optimization has been presented where the dispersion value for a space mission is estimated using a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm. The suggested method is used to solve several problems related to low-thrust orbit transfer of satellites in Earth's orbit. Results demonstrate that the suggested framework for trajectory design and optimization of space transfers is effective enough to offer fuel-efficient and energy-efficient maneuvers for different thrust levels of the propulsion system. Moreover, the performance of the proposed approach is evaluated against non-adaptive EDA and other advanced evolutionary algorithms. The obtained results certify that the proposed adaptive evolutionary approach is superior in identifying feasible minimum-fuel and minimum-energy transfer trajectories.",

        "description": "Estimation-of-distribution algorithms (EDAs) are optimization algorithms that learn a distribution from which good solutions can be sampled easily. A key parameter of most EDAs is the sample size (population size). Too small values lead to the undesired effect of genetic drift, while larger values slow down the process. Building on a quantitative analysis of how the population size leads to genetic drift, we design a smart-restart mechanism for EDAs. By stopping runs when the risk for genetic drift is high, it automatically runs the EDA in good parameter regimes. Via a mathematical runtime analysis, we prove a general performance guarantee for this smart-restart scheme. For many situations where the optimal parameter values are known, this shows that the restart scheme automatically finds these optimal values, leading to the asymptotically optimal performance. We also conduct an extensive experimental analysis. On four classic benchmarks, the smart-restart scheme leads to a performance close to the one obtainable with optimal parameter values. We also conduct experiments with PBIL (cross-entropy algorithm) on the max-cut problem and the bipartition problem. Again, the smart-restart mechanism finds much better values for the population size than those suggested in the literature, leading to a much better performance.",

This problem consists of dividing the field into small regions for which a specific rate of inputs is required. The objective is to minimize the number of management zones, which must be homogeneous according to a specific soil property: physical or chemical. Furthermore, as opposed to oval zones, SSMZ with rectangular shapes are preferable since they are more practical for agricultural technologies. The methodology we propose is based on evolutionary computation, specifically on a class of the estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). One of the strongest contributions of this study is the representation used to model the management zones, which generates zones with orthogonal shapes, for example, L or T shapes, and minimizes the number of zones required to delineate the field. The experimental results show that our method is efficient to solve real field and randomly generated instances. The average improvement of our method consists in reducing the number of management zones in the agricultural fields concerning other operations research methods presented in the literature. The improvement depends on the size of the field and the level of homogeneity established for the resulting management zones.",

We find that UMDA and the Paired-Crossover Evolutionary Algorithm (PCEA) are the only ones able to cope robustly with noise, within a reasonable fixed time budget. In the second stage, UMDA and PCEA are then tested on more complex noisy problems: SubsetSum, Knapsack, and SetCover. Both perform well under increasing levels of noise, with UMDA being the better of the two. In the third stage, we consider two noisy multiobjective problems (CountingOnesCountingZeros and a multiobjective formulation of SetCover). We compare several adaptations of UMDA for multiobjective problems with the Simple Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimiser (SEMO) and NSGA-II. We conclude that UMDA, and its variants, can be highly effective on a variety of noisy combinatorial optimisation, outperforming many other evolutionary algorithms.",

        "description": "Estimation-of-distribution algorithms (EDAs) are optimization algorithms that learn a distribution from which good solutions can be sampled easily. A key parameter of most EDAs is the sample size (population size). Too small values lead to the undesired effect of genetic drift, while larger values slow down the process. Building on a quantitative analysis of how the population size leads to genetic drift, we design a smart-restart mechanism for EDAs. By stopping runs when the risk for genetic drift is high, it automatically runs the EDA in good parameter regimes. Via a mathematical runtime analysis, we prove a general performance guarantee for this smart-restart scheme. For many situations where the optimal parameter values are known, this shows that the restart scheme automatically finds these optimal values, leading to the asymptotically optimal performance. We also conduct an extensive experimental analysis. On four classic benchmarks, the smart-restart scheme leads to a performance close to the one obtainable with optimal parameter values. We also conduct experiments with PBIL (cross-entropy algorithm) on the max-cut problem and the bipartition problem. Again, the smart-restart mechanism finds much better values for the population size than those suggested in the literature, leading to a much better performance.",

        "description": "In this paper, we present a novel methodology to solve the problem of delineating homogeneous site-specific management zones (SSMZ) in agricultural fields. This problem consists of dividing the field into small regions for which a specific rate of inputs is required. The objective is to minimize the number of management zones, which must be homogeneous according to a specific soil property: physical or chemical. Furthermore, as opposed to oval zones, SSMZ with rectangular shapes are preferable since they are more practical for agricultural technologies. The methodology we propose is based on evolutionary computation, specifically on a class of the estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). One of the strongest contributions of this study is the representation used to model the management zones, which generates zones with orthogonal shapes, for example, L or T shapes, and minimizes the number of zones required to delineate the field. The experimental results show that our method is efficient to solve real field and randomly generated instances. The average improvement of our method consists in reducing the number of management zones in the agricultural fields concerning other operations research methods presented in the literature. The improvement depends on the size of the field and the level of homogeneity established for the resulting management zones.",

        "description": "We present an empirical study of a range of evolutionary algorithms applied to various noisy combinatorial optimisation problems. There are three sets of experiments. The first looks at several toy problems, such as OneMax and other linear problems. We find that UMDA and the Paired-Crossover Evolutionary Algorithm (PCEA) are the only ones able to cope robustly with noise, within a reasonable fixed time budget. In the second stage, UMDA and PCEA are then tested on more complex noisy problems: SubsetSum, Knapsack, and SetCover. Both perform well under increasing levels of noise, with UMDA being the better of the two. In the third stage, we consider two noisy multiobjective problems (CountingOnesCountingZeros and a multiobjective formulation of SetCover). We compare several adaptations of UMDA for multiobjective problems with the Simple Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimiser (SEMO) and NSGA-II. We conclude that UMDA, and its variants, can be highly effective on a variety of noisy combinatorial optimisation, outperforming many other evolutionary algorithms.",

The spacecraft dynamics is modeled with respect to modified equinoctial elements by considering J2 orbital perturbations. Taking into account the timings of thrust arcs, the discretization nodes for thrust profile, and the solution of multi-impulse orbit transfer, a constrained continuous optimization problem is formed for low-thrust orbital maneuvers. An adaptive method within the framework of the estimation of distribution algorithms (EDA) is proposed, which aims at conserving the feasibility of the solutions within the search process. Several problem identifiers for low-thrust trajectory optimization are introduced, and the complexity of the solution domain is analyzed by evaluating the landscape feature of the search space via FLA. Two adaptive operators are proposed, which control the search process based on the need for exploration and exploitation of the search domain to achieve optimal transfers. The adaptive operators are implemented in the presented EDA and several perturbed and nonperturbed orbit transfer problems are solved. The results confirm the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed approach in finding optimal low-thrust transfer trajectories.",

        "description": "One particular kind of evolutionary algorithms known as Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) has gained the attention of the aerospace industry for its ability to solve nonlinear and complicated problems, particularly in the optimization of space trajectories during on-orbit operations of satellites. This article describes an effective method for optimizing the trajectory of a spacecraft using an evolutionary approach based on EDAs, incorporated with fitness landscape analysis (FLA). The approach utilizes flexible operators that are paired with seeding and selection mechanisms of EDAs. Initially, the orbit transfer problem is mathematically modeled and the objectives and constraints are identified. The landscape feature of the search space is analyzed via the dispersion metric to measure the modality and ruggedness of the search domain. The obtained information are used as feedback in developing adaptive operators for truncation factor and constraints separation threshold of the employed EDA. A framework for spacecraft trajectory optimization has been presented where the dispersion value for a space mission is estimated using a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm. The suggested method is used to solve several problems related to low-thrust orbit transfer of satellites in Earth's orbit. Results demonstrate that the suggested framework for trajectory design and optimization of space transfers is effective enough to offer fuel-efficient and energy-efficient maneuvers for different thrust levels of the propulsion system. Moreover, the performance of the proposed approach is evaluated against non-adaptive EDA and other advanced evolutionary algorithms. The obtained results certify that the proposed adaptive evolutionary approach is superior in identifying feasible minimum-fuel and minimum-energy transfer trajectories.",

        "description": "Denoising autoencoder genetic programming (DAE-GP) is a novel neural network-based estimation of distribution genetic programming approach that uses denoising autoencoder long short-term memory networks as a probabilistic model to replace the standard mutation and recombination operators of genetic programming. At each generation, the idea is to capture promising properties of the parent population in a probabilistic model and to use corruption to transfer variations of these properties to the offspring. This work studies the influence of corruption and sampling steps on search. Corruption partially mutates candidate solutions that are used as input to the model, whereas the number of sampling steps defines how often we re-use the output during model sampling as input to the model. We study the generalization of the royal tree problem, the Airfoil problem, and the Pagie-1 problem, and find that both corruption strength and the number of sampling steps influence exploration and exploitation in search and affect performance: exploration increases with stronger corruption and lower number of sampling steps. The results indicate that both corruption and sampling steps are key to the success of the DAE-GP: it permits us to balance the exploration and exploitation behavior in search, resulting in an improved search quality. However, also selection is important for exploration and exploitation and should be chosen wisely.",

They include a particular implementation of a clustering algorithm, outlier detection, and several heuristic mapping methods.

It offers a highly modular approach for estimating covariance functions of stationary processes. Our method can impose positive definiteness, as well as isotropy and monotonicity, on the estimators, and its hyperparameters can be decided using cross validation. We define our estimators by taking integral transforms of kernel-based distribution surrogates. We then use the iterated density estimation evolutionary algorithm, a variant of estimation of distribution algorithms, to fit the estimators. We also extend our method to estimate covariance functions for point-referenced data. Compared to alternative approaches, our method provides more reliable estimates for long-range dependence. Several numerical studies are performed to demonstrate the efficacy and performance of our method. Also, we illustrate our method using precipitation data from the Spatial Interpolation Comparison 97 project.",

However, it is very challenging to achieve an optimal subset of features as well as interpretable relationship among features due to computation complexity and variable diversity. In order to address those difficulties, this paper presents a novel evolutionary approach for feature selection algorithm to improve the effectiveness of existing meta-heuristic approaches. In other words, their optimal combinations with minimal difference between prediction and actual values can be achieved by applying an estimation of distribution algorithms (i.e., extended compact genetic algorithm) on the collected candidate feature sets. The approach discovers a less complicated and more closely related probabilistic-model structure on population space in each generation, thereby encouraging the comprehension power of feature selection results. We tested our method on six real-world data sets from manufacturing industries (open to the public). It demonstrated that higher interpretability on features selection results is achieved in comparison with well-known methods.",
