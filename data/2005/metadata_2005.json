        "description": "Since the Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) was introduced, different approaches in continuous domains have been developed. Initially, the single Gaussian distribution was broadly used when building the probabilistic models, which would normally mislead the search when dealing with multimodal functions. Some researchers later constructed EDAs that take advantage of mixture probability distributions by using clustering techniques. But their algorithms all need prior knowledge before applying clustering, which is unreasonable in real life. In this paper, two new EDAs for continuous optimization are proposed, both of which, incorporate clustering techniques into estimation process to break the single Gaussian distribution assumption.. The new algorithms, Clustering and Estimation of Gaussian Network Algorithm based on BGe metric and Clustering and Estimation of Gaussian Distribution Algorithm, not only show great advantage in optimizing multimodal functions with a few local optima, but also overcome the restriction of demanding prior knowledge before clustering by using a very reliable clustering technique, Rival Penalized Competitive Learning. This is the first time that EDAs have the ability to detect the number of global optima automatically. A set of experiments have been implemented to evaluate the performance of new algorithms. Besides the improvement over some multimodal functions, according to the No Free Lunch theory, their weak side is also showed.",

Unfortunately, this is a major source of difficulties for most estimation of distribution algorithms, making their effectiveness and efficiency degrade, due to genetic drift.

        "description": "The question of finding feasible ways for estimating probability distributions is one of the main challenges for Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs). To estimate the distribution of the selected solutions, EDAs use factorizations constructed according to graphical models. The class of factorizations that can be obtained from these probability models is highly constrained. Expanding the class of factorizations that could be employed for probability approximation is a necessary step for the conception of more robust EDAs. In this paper we introduce a method for learning a more general class of probability factorizations. The method combines a reformulation of a probability approximation procedure known in statistical physics as the Kikuchi approximation of energy, with a novel approach for finding graph decompositions. We present the Markov Network Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (MN-EDA), an EDA that uses Kikuchi approximations to estimate the distribution, and Gibbs Sampling (GS) to generate new points. A systematic empirical evaluation of MN-EDA is done in comparison with different Bayesian network based EDAs. From our experiments we conclude that the algorithm can outperform other EDAs that use traditional methods of probability approximation in the optimization of functions with strong interactions among their variables.",

For an important class of fitness functions, namely those with k-bounded epistasis, it is possible to construct a complete explicit representation of the fitness function by sampling the fitness function. A very natural model of the problem to be solved is the Boltzmann distribution of the fitness function, which is an exponential of the fitness normalized to a probability distribution. As the exponentiation factor (inverse temperature) of the Boltzmann distribution is increased, probability is increasingly concentrated on the set of optimal points. We show that for fitness functions of k-bounded epistasis that satisfy an additional property called the running intersection property, an explicit computable exact factorization of the Boltzmann distribution with an arbitrary exponentiation factor can be constructed. This factorization allows the Boltzmann distribution to be efficiently sampled, which leads to an algorithm which finds the optimum with high probability.",

Biped gait for a nine-link robot is firstly formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem with consideration of multi-constraints including balance and torque. Optimization parameters are angles at transition poses. Instead of searching the joint space directly, EDA is applied to estimate the probability distribution of each joint degree. By this means, inherent mapping relationship between joint coordinates and cost function can be described in term of probability density. Compared to common intelligent learning method, the proposed optimization method can formulate a proper and feasible combination of impulses by tuning less parameters and visiting less states. The effectiveness of the proposed EDA based biped gait optimization method has been tested on a soccer-playing humanoid robot named Robo-Erectus. Experiment results demonstrate that the learned trajectory makes a good balance between stability and energy cost in short learning epochs.",

Several algorithms have already been proposed by different authors. However, these algorithms may require huge computation power, which is seldom considered in those applications. This paper introduces a \"fast estimation of distribution algorithm\" (FEDA) for feature selection that does not evaluate all new individuals by actual fitness function, thus reducing the computational cost and improve the performance. Bayesian networks are used to model the probabilistic distribution and generate new individuals in the optimization process. Moreover, fitness value is assigned to each new individual using the extended Bayesian network as an approximate model to fitness function. Implementation issues such as individual control strategy, model management are addressed. Promising results are achieved in experiments on 5 UCI datasets. The results indicate that, as population-sizing requirements for building appropriate models of promising solutions lead to good fitness estimates, more compact feature subsets that give more accurate result can be found.",

To find the interactions among genes is one of the hottest topics in current genome research. The Bayesian Network (BN), which is a graph-based representation of a joint probability distribution that captures properties of conditional independence between variables, is a desirable tool to find the interaction between genes. However, how to find appropriate BNs that most fit to the data is very difficult since the number of possible BNs on n variables is the super-exponential of n. To avert the combinational explosion, in this paper, we use Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) to search the BN space. Also, in order to make the individuals of EDA meaningful, we also propose a depth-first search method to cut circles in the graph.

Finite population sampling in selection results in fluctuations which get reinforced when the probability model is updated. As a consequence, any probability model which can generate only a single set of values with probability 1 can be an attractive fixed point of the algorithm. To avoid this, parameters of the algorithm must scale with the system size in strongly problem-dependent ways, or the algorithm must be modified. This phenomenon is shown to hold for general EDAs as a consequence of the lack of ergodicity and irreducibility of the Markov chain on the state of probability models. It is illustrated in the case of UMDA, in which it is shown that the global optimum is only found if the population size is sufficiently large. For the needle-in-a haystack problem, the population size must scale as the square-root of the size of the search space. For the one-max problem, the population size must scale as the square-root of the problem size.",

First, we analyze the effect of selection in the arousal of probability dependencies in EDAs for random functions. We show that, for these functions, independence relationships not represented by the function structure are likely to appear in the probability model. Second, we propose an approach to approximate probability distributions in EDAs using a subset of the dependencies that exist in the data. An EDA that employs only malign interactions is introduced. Preliminary experiments presented show how the probability approximations based solely on malign interactions, can be applied to EDAs.",

The paper demonstrates that even if the linkage is correctly identified, massive multimodality of the search problems can easily overwhelm the nicher and lead to exponential scale-up. The exponential growth of the Pareto-optimal solutions introduces a fundamental limit on the scalability of MOEDAs and the number of competing sub-structures between the multiple objectives. Facetwise models are subsequently used to predict this limit in the growth rate of the number of differing substructures between the two objectives to avoid the niching method from being overwhelmed and lead to polynomial scalability of MOEDAs.",

The location information of solutions found so far (i.e., the actual positions of these solutions in the search space) is not directly used for generating offspring in most existing estimation of distribution algorithms. This paper introduces a new operator, called guided mutation. Guided mutation generates offspring through combination of global statistical information and the location information of solutions found so far. An evolutionary algorithm with guided mutation (EA/G) for the maximum clique problem is proposed in this paper. Besides guided mutation, EA/G adopts a strategy for searching different search areas in different search phases. Marchiori's heuristic is applied to each new solution to produce a maximal clique in EA/G. Experimental results show that EA/G outperforms the heuristic genetic algorithm of Marchiori (the best evolutionary algorithm reported so far) and a MIMIC algorithm on DIMACS benchmark graphs.",

It is a model-based recognition method where the input image is over-segmented and the obtained regions are represented by an attributed relational graph (ARG). This graph is then matched against a model graph thus accomplishing the model-based recognition task. This type of problem calls for inexact graph matching through a homomorphism between the graphs since no bijective correspondence can be expected, because of the over-segmentation of the image with respect to the model. The search for the best homomorphism is carried out by optimizing an objective function based on similarities between object and relational attributes defined on the graphs. The following optimization procedures are compared and discussed: deterministic tree search, for which new algorithms are detailed, genetic algorithms and estimation of distribution algorithms.

Our proposal include the use of two different topologies (ring and star) and two different types of information sharing between islands: individuals and models.

Compared with Darwinian-type genetic algorithms, the novel computing model Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) pay attention to analyzing the selected subpopulations, which makes it more suitable to tackle noisy optimizations. This paper first briefly introduces Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm (UMDA), and then proves that for WOneMax problem with noise, under the probability limited condition, UMDA can converge to the global optimal point. But for the limited population size, noise doesn't only delay the convergent time, but also aggravates genetic drift. Since Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm with Smoothing Filter (SUMDA) is a feasible technique to diminish genetic drift in UMDA, we adopt SUMDA to tackle noisy optimization. Numerical results show that this method is effective.",

        "description": "Migration of probabilistic models instead of individuals has been shown beneficial in Islands-based models of parallel univariate Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs). One of the key points when using this type of migration is how to incorporate the incoming probabilistic model to the inner one in a given island. When dealing with combinatorial optimization problems and univariate EDAs, models can be combined successfully by using a convex combination of the two probabilistic models [5]. In this paper we present an alternative way of combining probabilistic models. The new proposal for model combination is based on local search methods, and has its motivation in trying to identify what parts of the incoming model can help to improve the inner one, and to use only these parts to update the incoming model, instead of updating the whole one as in [5]. Several algorithms are proposed and evaluated by using different test problems. The experiments show that the new proposals perform better than those based on convex combination, especially in the most difficult test problems.",

        "description": "Of late, much progress has been made in developing Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDA), algorithms that use probabilistic modelling of high quality solutions to guide their search. While experimental results on EDA behaviour are widely available, theoretical results are still rare. This is especially the case for continuous EDA. In this article, we develop theory that predicts the behaviour of the Univariate Marginal Distribution, Algorithm in the continuous domain (UMDA(c)) with truncation selection on monotonous fitness functions. Monotonous functions are commonly used to model the algorithm behaviour far from the optimum. Our result includes formulae to predict population statistics in a specific generation as well as population statistics after convergence. We find that population statistics develop identically for monotonous functions. We show that if assuming monotonous fitness functions, the distance that UMDA(c) travels across the search space is bounded and solely relies on the percentage of selected individuals and not on the structure of the fitness landscape. This can be problematic if this distance is too small for the algorithm to find the optimum. Also, by wrongly setting the selection intensity, one might not be able to explore the whole search space.",

        "description": "The choice of genetic representation crucially determines the capability of evolutionary processes to find complex solutions in which many variables interact. The question is how good genetic representations can be found and how they can be adapted online to account for what can be learned about the structure of the problem from previous samples. We address these questions in a scenario that we term indirect Estimation-of-Distribution: We consider a decorrelated search distribution (mutational variability) on a variable length genotype space. A one-to-one encoding onto the phenotype space then needs to induce an adapted phenotypic variability incorporating the dependencies between phenotypic variables that have been observed successful previously. Formalizing this in the framework of Estimation-of-Distribution Algorithms, an adapted phenotypic variability can be characterized as minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence to a population of previously selected individuals (parents). Our core result is a relation between the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the description length of the encoding in the specific scenario, stating that compact codes provide a way to minimize this divergence. A proposed class of Compression Evolutionary Algorithms and preliminary experiments with an L-system compression scheme illustrate the approach. We also discuss the implications for the self-adaptive evolution of genetic representations on the basis of neutrality (sigma-evolution) towards compact codes.",

In this paper we explain the relationship of EDA to algorithms developed in statistics, artificial intelligence, and statistical physics. The major design issues are discussed within a general interdisciplinary framework. It is shown that maximum entropy approximations play a crucial role. All proposed algorithms try to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence KLD between the unknown distribution p(x) and a class q(x) of approximations. However, the Kullback-Leibler divergence is not symmetric. Approximations which suppose that the function to be optimized is additively decomposed (ADF) minimize KLD(q vertical bar vertical bar p), the methods which learn the approximate model from data minimize KLD(p vertical bar vertical bar q). This minimization is identical to maximizing the log-likelihood. In the paper three classes of algorithms are discussed. FDA uses the ADF to compute an approximate factorization of the unknown distribution. The factors are marginal distributions, whose values are computed from samples. The second class is represented by the Bethe-Kikuchi approach which has recently been rediscovered in statistical physics. Here the values of the marginals are computed from a difficult constrained minimization problem. The third class learns the factorization from the data. We analyze our learning algorithm LFDA in detail. It is shown that learning is faced with two problems: first, to detect the important dependencies between the variables, and second, to create an acyclic Bayesian network of bounded clique size.",

        "description": "In order to enhance efficiency of genetic algorithms, it is important to identify a linkage set, i.e. a set of loci tightly linked to construct a building block. In this paper, we propose a novel linkage identification method for real-valued strings called the real-valued Dependency Detection for Distribution Derived from df (rD(5)). It can detect linkage sets with quasi-linear fitness evaluations. The rD(5) is designed based on the D-5 which has been proposed for binary strings. It detects dependencies of loci by estimating the distribution of strings classified according to fitness differences. The rD(5) and the LINC-R which is one of linkage identification methods proposed elsewhere, provide approximate equivalent information about a function to be solved, however, the rD(5) performs smaller number of fitness evaluations than the LINC-R for larger functions. Although estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) also estimate distribution of strings, it is difficult for EDAs to solve a function composed of exponentially scaled sub-functions. The proposed method, by contrast, can be applied to the function in the similar way to as to a function composed of uniformly scaled sub-functions which is easy for EDAs. We perform experiments to compare the proposed method with the LINC-R and to examine the scaling effect stability of the rD(5). We also investigate two parameters, that define the amount of perturbation (mutation) and that define the quantization level.",

Finite population sampling in selection results in fluctuations which get reinforced when the probability model is updated. As a consequence, any probability model which can generate only a single set of values with probability 1 can be an attractive fixed point of the algorithm. To avoid this, parameters of the algorithm must scale with the system size in strongly problem-dependent ways, or the algorithm must be modified. This phenomenon is shown to hold for general EDAs as a consequence of the lack of ergodicity and irreducibility of the Markov chain on the state of probability models. It is illustrated in the case of UMDA, in which it is shown that the global optimum is only found if the population size is sufficiently large. For the needle-in-a haystack problem, the population size must scale as the square-root of the size of the search space. For the one-max problem, the population size must scale as the square-root of the problem size.",

The substructural niching method is compared to restricted tournament selection (RTS)-a niching method used in hierarchical Bayesian optimization algorithm-with special emphasis on sustained preservation of multiple global solutions of a class of boundedly-difficult, additively-separable multimodal problems. The results show that sub-structural niching successfully maintains multiple global optima over large number of generations and does so with significantly less population than RTS.

Guided mutation generates offspring through combination of global statistical information and the location information of solutions found so far. An evolutionary algorithm with guided mutation (EA/G) for the maximum clique problem is proposed in this paper. Besides guided mutation, EA/G adopts a strategy for searching different search areas in different search phases.

Here, we look at a simple - yet effective - extension of this paradigm for multi-objective optimization, called the naive MIDEA. The probabilistic model in this specific algorithm is a mixture distribution, and each component in the mixture is a univariate factorization. Mixture distributions allow for wide-spread exploration of the Pareto front thus aiding the important preservation of diversity in multi-objective optimization. Due to its simplicity, speed, and effectiveness the naive MIDEA can well serve as a baseline algorithm for multi-objective evolutionary algorithms.",

Inspired by the ideas from estimation of distribution algorithms, M-MOEA uses a probability model to capture the regularity of the distribution of the Pareto optimal solutions. The Local Principal Component Analysis(Local PCA) and the least-squares method are employed for building the model. New solutions are sampled from the model thus built. At alternate generations, M-MOEA uses crossover and mutation to produce new solutions. The selection in M-MOEA is the same as in Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II(NSGA-II). Therefore, MOEA can be regarded as a combination of EDA and NSGA-II. The preliminary experimental results show that M-MOEA performs better than NSGAII.",

This problem can be seen as a selection + prediction one, where the goal is to obtain good values for the variables to predict while minimizing the number of the input variables needed, taking a small subset of really significant ones. Initial approaches to the problem were Principal Components Analysis and Filtering. Then we used methods to make smarter reductions of variables, by means of parallel Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) to choose collections of variables that yield models with less average prediction errors. A final step was to use multi-objective parallel EDAs, in order to present a set of optimal solutions instead of a single solution.",

Inferring gene-gene interactions from time series data generated from these technologies is an important computational method to help us to understand the system behavior of living organisms [1]. The Bayesian Network (BN), which is a graph-based representation of a joint probability distribution that captures properties of conditional independence between variables, is a desirable tool. However, how to construct appropriate BNs that best fit the data profile is very difficult since the number of BNs on nvariables is the super-exponential of it. To avert the combinational explosion, in this paper, we use Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) to search the space. Also, in order to generate meaningful individuals, we also propose depth-first search method to cut circles in the graphs.

If an individual has a high fitness, it also has a high probability to survive and to generate offspring. Since in optimization of noisy fitness functions, the fitness of a candidate obtained is not accurate. This characteristic induces its clumsiness for noisy optimization. Compared with Darwinian-type genetic algorithms, the novel computing model Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) pay attention to analyzing the selected subpopulations, which makes it more suitable to tackle noisy optimizations. This paper first briefly introduces Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm (UMDA), and then proves that for WOneMax problem with noise, under the probability limited condition, UMDA can converge to the global optimal point. But for the limited population size, noise doesn't only delay the convergent time, but also aggravates genetic drift. Since Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm with Smoothing Filter (SUMDA) is a feasible technique to diminish genetic drift in UMDA, we adopt SUMDA to tackle noisy optimization. Numerical results show that this method is effective.",

One of the key points when using this type of migration is how to incorporate the incoming probabilistic model to the inner one in a given island. When dealing with combinatorial optimization problems and univariate EDAs, models can be combined successfully by using a convex combination of the two probabilistic models [5]. In this paper we present an alternative way of combining probabilistic models. The new proposal for model combination is based on local search methods, and has its motivation in trying to identify what parts of the incoming model can help to improve the inner one, and to use only these parts to update the incoming model, instead of updating the whole one as in [5]. Several algorithms are proposed and evaluated by using different test problems. The experiments show that the new proposals perform better than those based on convex combination, especially in the most difficult test problems.",

While experimental results on EDA behaviour are widely available, theoretical results are still rare. This is especially the case for continuous EDA. In this article, we develop theory that predicts the behaviour of the Univariate Marginal Distribution, Algorithm in the continuous domain (UMDA(c)) with truncation selection on monotonous fitness functions. Monotonous functions are commonly used to model the algorithm behaviour far from the optimum. Our result includes formulae to predict population statistics in a specific generation as well as population statistics after convergence. We find that population statistics develop identically for monotonous functions. We show that if assuming monotonous fitness functions, the distance that UMDA(c) travels across the search space is bounded and solely relies on the percentage of selected individuals and not on the structure of the fitness landscape. This can be problematic if this distance is too small for the algorithm to find the optimum. Also, by wrongly setting the selection intensity, one might not be able to explore the whole search space.",

        "description": "The choice of genetic representation crucially determines the capability of evolutionary processes to find complex solutions in which many variables interact. The question is how good genetic representations can be found and how they can be adapted online to account for what can be learned about the structure of the problem from previous samples. We address these questions in a scenario that we term indirect Estimation-of-Distribution: We consider a decorrelated search distribution (mutational variability) on a variable length genotype space. A one-to-one encoding onto the phenotype space then needs to induce an adapted phenotypic variability incorporating the dependencies between phenotypic variables that have been observed successful previously. Formalizing this in the framework of Estimation-of-Distribution Algorithms, an adapted phenotypic variability can be characterized as minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence to a population of previously selected individuals (parents). Our core result is a relation between the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the description length of the encoding in the specific scenario, stating that compact codes provide a way to minimize this divergence. A proposed class of Compression Evolutionary Algorithms and preliminary experiments with an L-system compression scheme illustrate the approach. We also discuss the implications for the self-adaptive evolution of genetic representations on the basis of neutrality (sigma-evolution) towards compact codes.",

In this paper we explain the relationship of EDA to algorithms developed in statistics, artificial intelligence, and statistical physics. The major design issues are discussed within a general interdisciplinary framework. It is shown that maximum entropy approximations play a crucial role. All proposed algorithms try to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence KLD between the unknown distribution p(x) and a class q(x) of approximations. However, the Kullback-Leibler divergence is not symmetric. Approximations which suppose that the function to be optimized is additively decomposed (ADF) minimize KLD(q vertical bar vertical bar p), the methods which learn the approximate model from data minimize KLD(p vertical bar vertical bar q). This minimization is identical to maximizing the log-likelihood. In the paper three classes of algorithms are discussed. FDA uses the ADF to compute an approximate factorization of the unknown distribution. The factors are marginal distributions, whose values are computed from samples. The second class is represented by the Bethe-Kikuchi approach which has recently been rediscovered in statistical physics. Here the values of the marginals are computed from a difficult constrained minimization problem. The third class learns the factorization from the data. We analyze our learning algorithm LFDA in detail. It is shown that learning is faced with two problems: first, to detect the important dependencies between the variables, and second, to create an acyclic Bayesian network of bounded clique size.",

In this paper, we propose a novel linkage identification method for real-valued strings called the real-valued Dependency Detection for Distribution Derived from df (rD(5)). It can detect linkage sets with quasi-linear fitness evaluations. The rD(5) is designed based on the D-5 which has been proposed for binary strings. It detects dependencies of loci by estimating the distribution of strings classified according to fitness differences. The rD(5) and the LINC-R which is one of linkage identification methods proposed elsewhere, provide approximate equivalent information about a function to be solved, however, the rD(5) performs smaller number of fitness evaluations than the LINC-R for larger functions. Although estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) also estimate distribution of strings, it is difficult for EDAs to solve a function composed of exponentially scaled sub-functions. The proposed method, by contrast, can be applied to the function in the similar way to as to a function composed of uniformly scaled sub-functions which is easy for EDAs. We perform experiments to compare the proposed method with the LINC-R and to examine the scaling effect stability of the rD(5).

Finite population sampling in selection results in fluctuations which get reinforced when the probability model is updated. As a consequence, any probability model which can generate only a single set of values with probability 1 can be an attractive fixed point of the algorithm. To avoid this, parameters of the algorithm must scale with the system size in strongly problem-dependent ways, or the algorithm must be modified. This phenomenon is shown to hold for general EDAs as a consequence of the lack of ergodicity and irreducibility of the Markov chain on the state of probability models. It is illustrated in the case of UMDA, in which it is shown that the global optimum is only found if the population size is sufficiently large. For the needle-in-a haystack problem, the population size must scale as the square-root of the size of the search space. For the one-max problem, the population size must scale as the square-root of the problem size.",

        "description": "The paper analyzes the scalability of multiobjective estimation of distribution algorithms (MOEDAs), particularly multiobjective extended compact genetic algorithm (meCGA), on a class of boundedly-difficult additively-separable multiobjective optimization problems. The paper demonstrates that even if the linkage is correctly identified, massive multimodality of the search problems can easily overwhelm the nicher and lead to exponential scale-up. The exponential growth of the Pareto-optimal solutions introduces a fundamental limit on the scalability of MOEDAs and the number of competing sub-structures between the multiple objectives. Facetwise models are subsequently used to predict this limit in the growth rate of the number of differing substructures between the two objectives to avoid the niching method from being overwhelmed and lead to polynomial scalability of MOEDAs.",

The location information of solutions found so far (i.e., the actual positions of these solutions in the search space) is not directly used for generating offspring in most existing estimation of distribution algorithms. This paper introduces a new operator, called guided mutation. Guided mutation generates offspring through combination of global statistical information and the location information of solutions found so far. An evolutionary algorithm with guided mutation (EA/G) for the maximum clique problem is proposed in this paper. Besides guided mutation, EA/G adopts a strategy for searching different search areas in different search phases. Marchiori's heuristic is applied to each new solution to produce a maximal clique in EA/G. Experimental results show that EA/G outperforms the heuristic genetic algorithm of Marchiori (the best evolutionary algorithm reported so far) and a MIMIC algorithm on DIMACS benchmark graphs.",

It is a model-based recognition method where the input image is over-segmented and the obtained regions are represented by an attributed relational graph (ARG). This graph is then matched against a model graph thus accomplishing the model-based recognition task. This type of problem calls for inexact graph matching through a homomorphism between the graphs since no bijective correspondence can be expected, because of the over-segmentation of the image with respect to the model. The search for the best homomorphism is carried out by optimizing an objective function based on similarities between object and relational attributes defined on the graphs. The following optimization procedures are compared and discussed: deterministic tree search, for which new algorithms are detailed, genetic algorithms and estimation of distribution algorithms.

The Bayesian Network (BN), which is a graph-based representation of a joint probability distribution that captures properties of conditional independence between variables, is a desirable tool. However, how to construct appropriate BNs that best fit the data profile is very difficult since the number of BNs on nvariables is the super-exponential of it.

If an individual has a high fitness, it also has a high probability to survive and to generate offspring.

Compared with Darwinian-type genetic algorithms, the novel computing model Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) pay attention to analyzing the selected subpopulations, which makes it more suitable to tackle noisy optimizations. This paper first briefly introduces Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm (UMDA), and then proves that for WOneMax problem with noise, under the probability limited condition, UMDA can converge to the global optimal point. But for the limited population size, noise doesn't only delay the convergent time, but also aggravates genetic drift. Since Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm with Smoothing Filter (SUMDA) is a feasible technique to diminish genetic drift in UMDA, we adopt SUMDA to tackle noisy optimization.

        "description": "Migration of probabilistic models instead of individuals has been shown beneficial in Islands-based models of parallel univariate Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs). One of the key points when using this type of migration is how to incorporate the incoming probabilistic model to the inner one in a given island. When dealing with combinatorial optimization problems and univariate EDAs, models can be combined successfully by using a convex combination of the two probabilistic models [5]. In this paper we present an alternative way of combining probabilistic models. The new proposal for model combination is based on local search methods, and has its motivation in trying to identify what parts of the incoming model can help to improve the inner one, and to use only these parts to update the incoming model, instead of updating the whole one as in [5]. Several algorithms are proposed and evaluated by using different test problems. The experiments show that the new proposals perform better than those based on convex combination, especially in the most difficult test problems.",

        "description": "Of late, much progress has been made in developing Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDA), algorithms that use probabilistic modelling of high quality solutions to guide their search. While experimental results on EDA behaviour are widely available, theoretical results are still rare. This is especially the case for continuous EDA. In this article, we develop theory that predicts the behaviour of the Univariate Marginal Distribution, Algorithm in the continuous domain (UMDA(c)) with truncation selection on monotonous fitness functions. Monotonous functions are commonly used to model the algorithm behaviour far from the optimum. Our result includes formulae to predict population statistics in a specific generation as well as population statistics after convergence. We find that population statistics develop identically for monotonous functions. We show that if assuming monotonous fitness functions, the distance that UMDA(c) travels across the search space is bounded and solely relies on the percentage of selected individuals and not on the structure of the fitness landscape. This can be problematic if this distance is too small for the algorithm to find the optimum. Also, by wrongly setting the selection intensity, one might not be able to explore the whole search space.",

        "description": "The choice of genetic representation crucially determines the capability of evolutionary processes to find complex solutions in which many variables interact. The question is how good genetic representations can be found and how they can be adapted online to account for what can be learned about the structure of the problem from previous samples. We address these questions in a scenario that we term indirect Estimation-of-Distribution: We consider a decorrelated search distribution (mutational variability) on a variable length genotype space. A one-to-one encoding onto the phenotype space then needs to induce an adapted phenotypic variability incorporating the dependencies between phenotypic variables that have been observed successful previously. Formalizing this in the framework of Estimation-of-Distribution Algorithms, an adapted phenotypic variability can be characterized as minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence to a population of previously selected individuals (parents). Our core result is a relation between the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the description length of the encoding in the specific scenario, stating that compact codes provide a way to minimize this divergence. A proposed class of Compression Evolutionary Algorithms and preliminary experiments with an L-system compression scheme illustrate the approach. We also discuss the implications for the self-adaptive evolution of genetic representations on the basis of neutrality (sigma-evolution) towards compact codes.",

        "description": "Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDA) have been proposed as an extension of genetic algorithms. In this paper we explain the relationship of EDA to algorithms developed in statistics, artificial intelligence, and statistical physics. The major design issues are discussed within a general interdisciplinary framework. It is shown that maximum entropy approximations play a crucial role. All proposed algorithms try to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence KLD between the unknown distribution p(x) and a class q(x) of approximations. However, the Kullback-Leibler divergence is not symmetric. Approximations which suppose that the function to be optimized is additively decomposed (ADF) minimize KLD(q vertical bar vertical bar p), the methods which learn the approximate model from data minimize KLD(p vertical bar vertical bar q). This minimization is identical to maximizing the log-likelihood. In the paper three classes of algorithms are discussed. FDA uses the ADF to compute an approximate factorization of the unknown distribution. The factors are marginal distributions, whose values are computed from samples. The second class is represented by the Bethe-Kikuchi approach which has recently been rediscovered in statistical physics. Here the values of the marginals are computed from a difficult constrained minimization problem. The third class learns the factorization from the data. We analyze our learning algorithm LFDA in detail. It is shown that learning is faced with two problems: first, to detect the important dependencies between the variables, and second, to create an acyclic Bayesian network of bounded clique size.",

        "description": "In order to enhance efficiency of genetic algorithms, it is important to identify a linkage set, i.e. a set of loci tightly linked to construct a building block. In this paper, we propose a novel linkage identification method for real-valued strings called the real-valued Dependency Detection for Distribution Derived from df (rD(5)). It can detect linkage sets with quasi-linear fitness evaluations. The rD(5) is designed based on the D-5 which has been proposed for binary strings. It detects dependencies of loci by estimating the distribution of strings classified according to fitness differences. The rD(5) and the LINC-R which is one of linkage identification methods proposed elsewhere, provide approximate equivalent information about a function to be solved, however, the rD(5) performs smaller number of fitness evaluations than the LINC-R for larger functions. Although estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) also estimate distribution of strings, it is difficult for EDAs to solve a function composed of exponentially scaled sub-functions. The proposed method, by contrast, can be applied to the function in the similar way to as to a function composed of uniformly scaled sub-functions which is easy for EDAs. We perform experiments to compare the proposed method with the LINC-R and to examine the scaling effect stability of the rD(5). We also investigate two parameters, that define the amount of perturbation (mutation) and that define the quantization level.",

Finite population sampling in selection results in fluctuations which get reinforced when the probability model is updated. As a consequence, any probability model which can generate only a single set of values with probability 1 can be an attractive fixed point of the algorithm. To avoid this, parameters of the algorithm must scale with the system size in strongly problem-dependent ways, or the algorithm must be modified. This phenomenon is shown to hold for general EDAs as a consequence of the lack of ergodicity and irreducibility of the Markov chain on the state of probability models. It is illustrated in the case of UMDA, in which it is shown that the global optimum is only found if the population size is sufficiently large. For the needle-in-a haystack problem, the population size must scale as the square-root of the size of the search space. For the one-max problem, the population size must scale as the square-root of the problem size.",

The substructural niching method is compared to restricted tournament selection (RTS)-a niching method used in hierarchical Bayesian optimization algorithm-with special emphasis on sustained preservation of multiple global solutions of a class of boundedly-difficult, additively-separable multimodal problems. The results show that sub-structural niching successfully maintains multiple global optima over large number of generations and does so with significantly less population than RTS. Additionally, the market share of each of the niche is much closer to the expected level in sub-structural niching when compared to RTS.",

The exponential growth of the Pareto-optimal solutions introduces a fundamental limit on the scalability of MOEDAs and the number of competing sub-structures between the multiple objectives.

This paper introduces a new operator, called guided mutation. Guided mutation generates offspring through combination of global statistical information and the location information of solutions found so far. An evolutionary algorithm with guided mutation (EA/G) for the maximum clique problem is proposed in this paper. Besides guided mutation, EA/G adopts a strategy for searching different search areas in different search phases. Marchiori's heuristic is applied to each new solution to produce a maximal clique in EA/G.

Here, we look at a simple - yet effective - extension of this paradigm for multi-objective optimization, called the naive MIDEA. The probabilistic model in this specific algorithm is a mixture distribution, and each component in the mixture is a univariate factorization. Mixture distributions allow for wide-spread exploration of the Pareto front thus aiding the important preservation of diversity in multi-objective optimization. Due to its simplicity, speed, and effectiveness the naive MIDEA can well serve as a baseline algorithm for multi-objective evolutionary algorithms.",

We start by making several enhancements to a GA for the SCP that was proposed by Beasley and Chu. Next, several hybrid solution approaches are introduced that combine the GA with various local neighbourhood search approaches, with a form of the greedy randomized adaptive search procedure, and with an estimation of distribution algorithms approach. Using Beasley's library of SCPs extensive computational results are generated for the hybrid solution approaches defined in this paper. Statistical analyses of the results are performed.",

For this purpose they conduct a sampling-evaluation-adjustment cycle, where search points are sampled with respect to a probability distribution, which is adjusted according to the evaluation of the sampled points. Although there are many successful experiments suggesting the usefulness of EDAs, there are only few rigorous theoretical results apart from convergence results without time bounds. Here we present first rigorous runtime analyses of a simple EDA, the compact genetic algorithm, for linear pseudo-boolean functions on n variables.

DEUM and DEUMd use a univariate model of probability distribution, and have been shown to perform better than other univariate EDAs for a range of optimization problems. This paper extends DEUMd to incorporate a simple Metropolis method and empirically shows that for linear univariate problems the proposed univariate MRF models are very effective. In particular, the proposed DEUMd algorithm can find the solution in O(n) fitness evaluations.

Most existing evolutionary algorithms do not explicitly take advantage of such a regularity. This paper proposed a model-based evolutionary algorithm (M-MOEA) for bi-objective optimization problems. Inspired by the ideas from estimation of distribution algorithms, M-MOEA uses a probability model to capture the regularity of the distribution of the Pareto optimal solutions. The Local Principal Component Analysis(Local PCA) and the least-squares method are employed for building the model. New solutions are sampled from the model thus built. At alternate generations, M-MOEA uses crossover and mutation to produce new solutions. The selection in M-MOEA is the same as in Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II(NSGA-II). Therefore, MOEA can be regarded as a combination of EDA and NSGA-II. The preliminary experimental results show that M-MOEA performs better than NSGAII.",

This problem can be seen as a selection + prediction one, where the goal is to obtain good values for the variables to predict while minimizing the number of the input variables needed, taking a small subset of really significant ones. Initial approaches to the problem were Principal Components Analysis and Filtering. Then we used methods to make smarter reductions of variables, by means of parallel Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) to choose collections of variables that yield models with less average prediction errors. A final step was to use multi-objective parallel EDAs, in order to present a set of optimal solutions instead of a single solution.",

Inferring gene-gene interactions from time series data generated from these technologies is an important computational method to help us to understand the system behavior of living organisms [1]. The Bayesian Network (BN), which is a graph-based representation of a joint probability distribution that captures properties of conditional independence between variables, is a desirable tool. However, how to construct appropriate BNs that best fit the data profile is very difficult since the number of BNs on nvariables is the super-exponential of it. To avert the combinational explosion, in this paper, we use Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) to search the space. Also, in order to generate meaningful individuals, we also propose depth-first search method to cut circles in the graphs. We have tested our method on cell-cycle gene expression data and found that it can not only discover some existing relationships in other literatures and Gene Ontology, but also reveal some previously unknown interactions.",

If an individual has a high fitness, it also has a high probability to survive and to generate offspring. Since in optimization of noisy fitness functions, the fitness of a candidate obtained is not accurate. This characteristic induces its clumsiness for noisy optimization. Compared with Darwinian-type genetic algorithms, the novel computing model Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) pay attention to analyzing the selected subpopulations, which makes it more suitable to tackle noisy optimizations. This paper first briefly introduces Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm (UMDA), and then proves that for WOneMax problem with noise, under the probability limited condition, UMDA can converge to the global optimal point. But for the limited population size, noise doesn't only delay the convergent time, but also aggravates genetic drift. Since Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm with Smoothing Filter (SUMDA) is a feasible technique to diminish genetic drift in UMDA, we adopt SUMDA to tackle noisy optimization. Numerical results show that this method is effective.",

One of the key points when using this type of migration is how to incorporate the incoming probabilistic model to the inner one in a given island. When dealing with combinatorial optimization problems and univariate EDAs, models can be combined successfully by using a convex combination of the two probabilistic models [5]. In this paper we present an alternative way of combining probabilistic models. The new proposal for model combination is based on local search methods, and has its motivation in trying to identify what parts of the incoming model can help to improve the inner one, and to use only these parts to update the incoming model, instead of updating the whole one as in [5]. Several algorithms are proposed and evaluated by using different test problems. The experiments show that the new proposals perform better than those based on convex combination, especially in the most difficult test problems.",

While experimental results on EDA behaviour are widely available, theoretical results are still rare. This is especially the case for continuous EDA. In this article, we develop theory that predicts the behaviour of the Univariate Marginal Distribution, Algorithm in the continuous domain (UMDA(c)) with truncation selection on monotonous fitness functions. Monotonous functions are commonly used to model the algorithm behaviour far from the optimum. Our result includes formulae to predict population statistics in a specific generation as well as population statistics after convergence. We find that population statistics develop identically for monotonous functions. We show that if assuming monotonous fitness functions, the distance that UMDA(c) travels across the search space is bounded and solely relies on the percentage of selected individuals and not on the structure of the fitness landscape. This can be problematic if this distance is too small for the algorithm to find the optimum. Also, by wrongly setting the selection intensity, one might not be able to explore the whole search space.",

        "description": "The choice of genetic representation crucially determines the capability of evolutionary processes to find complex solutions in which many variables interact. The question is how good genetic representations can be found and how they can be adapted online to account for what can be learned about the structure of the problem from previous samples. We address these questions in a scenario that we term indirect Estimation-of-Distribution: We consider a decorrelated search distribution (mutational variability) on a variable length genotype space. A one-to-one encoding onto the phenotype space then needs to induce an adapted phenotypic variability incorporating the dependencies between phenotypic variables that have been observed successful previously. Formalizing this in the framework of Estimation-of-Distribution Algorithms, an adapted phenotypic variability can be characterized as minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence to a population of previously selected individuals (parents). Our core result is a relation between the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the description length of the encoding in the specific scenario, stating that compact codes provide a way to minimize this divergence. A proposed class of Compression Evolutionary Algorithms and preliminary experiments with an L-system compression scheme illustrate the approach. We also discuss the implications for the self-adaptive evolution of genetic representations on the basis of neutrality (sigma-evolution) towards compact codes.",

In this paper we explain the relationship of EDA to algorithms developed in statistics, artificial intelligence, and statistical physics. The major design issues are discussed within a general interdisciplinary framework. It is shown that maximum entropy approximations play a crucial role. All proposed algorithms try to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence KLD between the unknown distribution p(x) and a class q(x) of approximations. However, the Kullback-Leibler divergence is not symmetric. Approximations which suppose that the function to be optimized is additively decomposed (ADF) minimize KLD(q vertical bar vertical bar p), the methods which learn the approximate model from data minimize KLD(p vertical bar vertical bar q). This minimization is identical to maximizing the log-likelihood. In the paper three classes of algorithms are discussed. FDA uses the ADF to compute an approximate factorization of the unknown distribution. The factors are marginal distributions, whose values are computed from samples. The second class is represented by the Bethe-Kikuchi approach which has recently been rediscovered in statistical physics. Here the values of the marginals are computed from a difficult constrained minimization problem. The third class learns the factorization from the data. We analyze our learning algorithm LFDA in detail. It is shown that learning is faced with two problems: first, to detect the important dependencies between the variables, and second, to create an acyclic Bayesian network of bounded clique size.",

        "description": "In order to enhance efficiency of genetic algorithms, it is important to identify a linkage set, i.e. a set of loci tightly linked to construct a building block. In this paper, we propose a novel linkage identification method for real-valued strings called the real-valued Dependency Detection for Distribution Derived from df (rD(5)). It can detect linkage sets with quasi-linear fitness evaluations. The rD(5) is designed based on the D-5 which has been proposed for binary strings. It detects dependencies of loci by estimating the distribution of strings classified according to fitness differences. The rD(5) and the LINC-R which is one of linkage identification methods proposed elsewhere, provide approximate equivalent information about a function to be solved, however, the rD(5) performs smaller number of fitness evaluations than the LINC-R for larger functions. Although estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) also estimate distribution of strings, it is difficult for EDAs to solve a function composed of exponentially scaled sub-functions. The proposed method, by contrast, can be applied to the function in the similar way to as to a function composed of uniformly scaled sub-functions which is easy for EDAs. We perform experiments to compare the proposed method with the LINC-R and to examine the scaling effect stability of the rD(5). We also investigate two parameters, that define the amount of perturbation (mutation) and that define the quantization level.",
