        "description": "The protein-ligand docking problem plays an essential role in structure -based drug design. The challenge for a protein-ligand docking method is how to execute an efficient conformational search to explore a well -designed scoring function. In this study, we improved the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm and proposed an approach called ABC-EDM to solve the protein-ligand docking problem. ABC-EDM employs the scoring function of the classical AutoDock Vina to evaluate a solution during docking simulation. ABCEDM adopts the search framework of the canonical ABC algorithm to execute conformational search. By further investigating the characteristics of the protein-ligand docking problem, a proprietary search mechanism inspired by estimation of distribution algorithm, i.e., estimation of distribution mechanism (EDM), is designed to enhance the performance of ABC-EDM. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed ABC-EDM, we compare it with three variants of the ABC algorithm, three evolutionary computation algorithms, and AutoDock Vina. The experimental results show that ABC-EDM can effectively solve the protein-ligand docking problem, and it can achieve a success rate 5% higher than AutoDock Vina on the GOLD dataset. This study reveals that taking advantage of problem -specific information about the protein-ligand docking problem to enhance a docking method contributes to solving this problem.",

To address the challenges in balancing robotic assembly lines, timely part feeding, and the need for sustainable manufacturing, this paper studies an energy -efficient Joint Robotic Assembly Line Balancing and Feeding Problem (JRALB-FP) with the criteria of minimizing both cycle time and total fuel consumption cost. Considering the complexity of the multi -problem and multi -objective optimization, a knowledge -guided Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (KEDA) is proposed to solve energy -efficient JRALB-FP. First, a probability model of EDA for task -workstation allocation paired with a heuristic method -based sampling mechanism is created. Using this probability model, a specific encoding mechanism is designed for part -trailer allocation, and good initial solutions are produced. Second, several properties of the bi-objective problem are analyzed to guide the design of local search operators for both objectives optimization. Third, the updating mechanism of the probability model is designed to learn from the elite solutions. Fourth, two knowledge -guided local search operators are designed and implemented to exploit better non -dominated solutions sufficiently. A design of experiment is carried out to determine the parameters. Extensive computational tests and comparisons with the state-of-the-art multi -objective algorithms are carried out, which verify the effectiveness of the knowledge -guided local search operators, the problem -oriented heuristic -based sampling mechanism, and the special designs of the KEDA in solving the energy -efficient JRALB-FP.",

The proposal is called the Differential Mutation Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (DMEDA), where the inclusion of the Differential Mutation increases the standard EDA's exploration capacity. The performance of the DMEDA for image segmentation is tested using Otsu's between-class variance and Kapur's entropy as objective functions applied separately over the Berkeley Segmentation Data Set 300 (BSDS300). Besides, a comparative study includes eight well-known algorithms in the literature. In this sense, statistical and non-parametric tests are performed to verify the efficiency of the DMEDA in solving the image segmentation problem from an optimization perspective. In terms of segmentation, different metrics are employed to verify the capabilities of the DMEDA to segment digital images properly.

An extension of this problem is the Payment at Event Occurrences (PEO) scheme, where the client makes multiple payments to the contractor upon completion of predefined activities, with additional final settlement at project completion. Numerous approximation methods such as metaheuristics have been proposed to solve this NP-hard problem. However, these methods suffer from parameter control and/or the computational cost of correcting infeasible solutions. Alternatively, approximate dynamic programming (ADP) sequentially generates a schedule based on strategies computed via Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. This saves the computations required for solution corrections, but its performance is highly dependent on its strategy. In this study, we propose the hybridization of ADP with three different metaheuristics to take advantage of their combined strengths, resulting in six different models. The Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) were used to recommend policies for ADP. A Discrete cCuckoo Search (DCS) further improved the schedules generated by ADP. Our experimental analysis performed on the j30, j60, and j90 datasets of PSPLIB has shown that ADP-DCS is better than ADP alone. Implementing the EDA and ACO as prioritization strategies for Monte Carlo simulations greatly improved the solutions with high statistical significance. In addition, models with the EDA showed better performance than those with ACO and random priority, especially when the number of events increased.",

To address this challenge, this study proposes an online ecological energy management strategy using the optimal state of charge (SOC) prediction and stochastic optimization. Future energy-consumption features at each location are computed from the traffic and route information of the entire remaining trip and the optimal SOC value at the next location is predicted from the computed features using a recurrent neural network. By considering the predicted optimal SOC and average speed as references, the speed and SOC values at the next location are optimized using a modified estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA). The process of generating initial and new populations in EDA is modified for fast and reliable convergence. The optimal SOC prediction considering the energy consumption for the entire remaining trip from the current to final locations ensures long-term optimality. Stochastic aspects of the modified EDA can compensate for potential neural-network errors. The prediction and optimization of driving only up to the next location enables to adapt to the changes in traffic conditions. Moreover, the energy efficiency is further improved by optimizing power demand based on the characteristics of the drivetrain, as well as traffic and route conditions. Because the traffic and route information are provided on a location basis, management is performed in a distance domain. The proposed management strategy is evaluated in diverse driving scenarios, and it exhibits good performance, comparable to that of the offline optimization.",

        "description": "Mutation testing, a mainstream fault-based software testing technique, can mimic a wide variety of software faults by seeding them into the target program and resulting in the so-called mutants. Test data generated in mutation testing should be able to kill as many mutants as possible, hence guaranteeing a high fault-detection effectiveness of testing. Nevertheless, the test data generation can be very expensive, because mutation testing normally involves an extremely large number of mutants and some mutants are hard to kill. It is thus a critical yet challenging job to find an efficient way to generate a small set of test data that are able to kill multiple mutants at the same time as well as reveal those hard-to-detect faults. In this paper, we propose a new approach for test data generation in mutation testing, through the novel applications of the Markov chain usage model and the estimation of distribution algorithm. We first utilize the Markov chain usage model to reduce the so-called mutant branches in weak mutation testing and generate a minimal set of extended paths. Then, we regard the problem of generating test data as the problem of covering extended paths and use an estimation of distribution algorithm based on probability model to solve the problem. Finally, we develop a framework, TAMMEA, to implement the new approach of generating test data for mutation testing. The empirical studies based on fifteen object programs show that TAMMEA can kill more mutants using fewer test data compared with baseline techniques. In addition, the computation overhead of TAMMEA is lower than that of the baseline technique based on the traditional genetic algorithm, and comparable to that of the random method. It is clear that the new approach improves both the effectiveness and efficiency of mutation testing, thus promoting its practicability.",

An enhanced Kalman filtering and historical learning mechanism-driven EDA (KFHLEDA) is proposed to adjust the search direction and enlarge the search range of classical EDA in this paper. The enhanced Kalman filtering is designed in allusion to specific problems during the search through the prediction, observation, and the first and second revision stages. A historical archive is integrated into KFHLEDA to store the elite individuals with specific knowledge and diverse solutions from Kalman filtering. The elite strategy is embedded in the revision improvement matrix to revise modeling data, which is fed back to the probabilistic model through the historical learning mechanism with previous promising solutions to estimate the covariance matrix. The population adaptive adjustment strategy is introduced to reduce the number of invalid iterations. The effectiveness of the proposed KFHLEDA is proved through theoretical analysis. The evaluation results on benchmark functions of the CEC 2017 test suit validate that the KFHLEDA is efficient and competitive compared with fifteen classical metaheuristic algorithms and state-of-the-art EDA variants.",

How to solve MVOPs efficiently has been a challengeable issue. In this paper, we propose a mixed-variable optimization algorithm called coevolutionary estimation of distribution algorithm (CoEDAmv). First, a dynamic differential grouping (DDG) method is employed to improve the search efficiency of CoEDAmv, in which both the interaction of variables and search performance on the current search region are considered simultaneously. Second, two probabilistic models, i.e. fitness rank based continuous histogram (FRCH) and fitness rank based discrete histogram (FRDH), are proposed to handle continuous and discrete variables respectively, which can benefit from elite individuals obtained during the fitness ranking strategy and enhance the convergence performance with the elite neighborhood-based updating probability strategy.

These problems lack explicit expressions and are characterized by high invocation costs. SAEAs leverage surrogate models to accelerate convergence towards the optimal region and reduce the number of function evaluations. While Gaussian Processes (GPs) are widely used due to their robustness and capability of providing uncertainty estimates, their applicability becomes limited in scenarios involving a large number of samples or high-dimensional spaces. This is due to their cubic time complexity in relation to the number of samples, which results in prohibitive computational demands for large-scale problems. To address the challenge, this work presents an efficient surrogate model-assisted estimation of the distribution algorithm (ESAEDA). This method employs a random forest as a surrogate model and combines it with a GP-hedge acquisition strategy to ensure the efficiency and accuracy of model-assisted selection. An improved EDA model called the variable-width histogram model with some unevaluated solutions is used to generate new solutions. To demonstrate the benefits of the proposed method, we compared ESAEDA with several state-of-the-art surrogate-assisted evaluation algorithms and the Bayesian optimization method.

Addressing the parameter reconstruction of the reflection spectrum, an objective function is formulated to pinpoint the Bragg wavelength detection problem, with the optimal solution acquired via EDA. By incorporating spectral distortion into the objective function, the EDA-based method effectively manages distorted spectrums, ensuring the fidelity of wavelength data. Further, CNN aids in extracting features from the entire FBG sensor network's wavelength information, facilitating the creation of the localization model. By sending the reliable wavelength data obtained by EDA to the trained model, swift identification of the load position is achieved. Testing revealed that under conditions of spectral distortion, EDA can adeptly detect the Bragg wavelength. Additionally, the CNN-trained localization model outperforms other machine-learning techniques. Notably, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed EDA surpasses the second-ranked method, i.e., the maximum method, achieving a root mean square error (RMSE) of merely 1.4503 mm which is substantially lower than the 6.2463 mm achieved by the maximum method. The average localization error remains under 2 mm when 5 out of 9 FBGs' reflection spectra are distorted. Furthermore, Bragg wavelength detection error stays below 1 pm amid spectral distortion. Consequently, our method offers promising application prospects for long-term FBG sensor network monitoring, ensuring high accuracy and robustness in detecting structural damage.",

This paper proposes an Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) for feature selection tailored to regression problems with a multi-objective approach. The objective is to maximize the performance of learning models and minimize the number of selected features. We use a Bayesian Network (BN) as the EDA distribution probability model. The main contribution of this work is the process used to create this BN structure. It aims to capture the redundancy and relevance among features. Also, the BN is used to create the initial EDA population.

The transportation process of transport trucks in underground mines is analyzed. The dispatching model of transport trucks in underground mines is constructed based on the requirements of reducing transportation costs and increasing transportation efficiencies, taking into account the truck meeting situation in the ramp section and minimizing the total shift transportation distance and the total waiting time of transport trucks as the objective functions. The improved estimation of distribution algorithm is used to solve the truck scheduling model, resulting in the optimal ore blending and scheduling schemes. The comparative analysis employs a genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization algorithm, and immune algorithm. The results demonstrate that, compared to other algorithms, the improved estimation of distribution algorithm proposed in this paper has superior performance in terms of convergence speed and the search for the optimal solution. The total number of transportation tasks associated with the optimal ore allocation scheme is at least 82, and the waiting time associated with the optimal scheduling scheme is reduced to 7.5 min.

        "description": "With the increasing level of mass-customization and globalization of competition, environmentally friendly production scheduling for distributed manufacturing considering customer satisfaction has received growing attention. Meanwhile, uncertain scheduling is becoming a force to be considered within intelligent manufacturing industries. However, little research has been found that surveyed the uncertain distributed scheduling considering both energy consumption and customer satisfaction. In this article, the fuzzy distributed hybrid flow-shop scheduling problem considering on-time delivery (FDHFSP-OTD) is addressed, and a 3-D estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) with reinforcement learning (RL) is proposed to minimize the makespan and total energy consumption while maximizing delivery accuracy. First, two heuristics and a random method are designed and used cooperatively for initialization. Next, an EDA with a 3-D probability matrix is innovated to generate offspring. Then, a biased decoding method based on Q-learning is proposed to adjust the direction of evolution self-adaptively. Moreover, a local intensification strategy is employed for further enhancement of elite solutions. The effect of major parameters is analyzed and the best combination of values is determined through extensive experiments. The numerical results prove the effectiveness of each specially designed strategy and method, and the comparisons with existing algorithms demonstrate the high-potential of the 3D-EDA/RL in solving the FDHFSP-OTD.",

        "description": "Choosing a suitable algorithm from the myriads of different search heuristics is difficult when faced with a novel optimization problem. In this work, we argue that the purely academic question of what could be the best possible algorithm in a certain broad class of black-box optimizers can give fruitful indications in which direction to search for good established heuristics. We demonstrate this approach on the recently proposed DLB benchmark. Our finding that the unary unbiased black-box complexity is only O (n2) suggests the Metropolis algorithm as an interesting candidate and we prove that it solves the DLB problem in quadratic time. We also prove that better runtimes cannot be obtained in the class of unary unbiased algorithms. We therefore shift our attention to algorithms that use the information of more parents to generate new solutions and find that the significance-based compact genetic algorithm can solve the DLB problem in time O (n log n).(c) 2023 The Author(s).

        "description": "This article studies an operation optimization problem in a steelmaking process. Shortly before the tapping of molten steel from the basic oxygen furnace (BOF), end-point control measures are applied to achieve the required final molten steel quality. While it is difficult to build an exact mathematical model for this process, the control inputs and the corresponding outputs are available by collecting production data. We build a data-driven model for the process. To optimize the control parameters, an improved estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) is developed using a probabilistic model comprising different distributions. A resampling mechanism is incorporated into the EDA to guide the new population to a broader and more promising area when the search becomes ineffective. To further enhance the solution quality, we add a local improvement to update the current best individual through simplified gravitational search and information learning. Experiments are conducted using real data from a BOF steelmaking process. The results show that the algorithm can help to achieve the specified molten steel quality. To evaluate the proposed algorithm as a general optimization algorithm, we test it on some complex benchmark functions. The results illustrate that it outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms across a wide range of problems.",

This paper considers emergency scheduling of rescue tasks under stochastic deterioration of the injured. First, a mathematical model is established to minimize the average mathematical expectation of all tasks' completion time and casualty loss. Second, an improved multi-objective estimation of distribution algorithm (IMEDA) is proposed to solve this problem. In the IMDEA, an effective initialization strategy is designed for obtaining a superior population. Then, three statistical models are constructed, which include two tasks existing in the same rescue team, the probability of first task being processed by a rescue team, and the adjacency between two tasks. Afterward, an improved sampling method based on referenced sequence is employed to efficiently generate offspring population. Three multi-objective local search methods are presented to improve the exploitation in promising areas around elite individuals. Furthermore, the parameter calibration and effectiveness of components of IMEDA are tested through experiments. Finally, the comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art multi-objective algorithms demonstrates that IMEDA is a high-performing approach for the considered problem.",

        "description": "In this paper we present an evolutionary heuristic for the offline two-dimensional variable-sized bin packing problem. In this problem we have to pack a set of rectangles into two-dimensional variable-sized rectangular bins. The bins are divided into types, and the bins in different types have different sizes and possibly different weights (costs). There are (sufficiently) many bins from each type, and any rectangle fits into at least one bin-type. The goal is to pack the rectangles into the bins without overlap, parallel to the sides, so that the total area of the used bins (or total cost) is minimized. Our algorithm is a hybrid heuristic. It uses two different techniques to generate the descendants: either estimation of distribution algorithm and sampling the resulting probability model, or applying the usual operators of evolutionary algorithms (selection, mutation). To pack the rectangles into the bins the algorithm uses the strategy of randomly choosing one of two placement heuristics, that pack always only one group (one to three) of rectangles. It improves the quality of the solutions with three local search procedures. The algorithm has been tested on benchmark instances from the literature and has been compared with other heuristics and metaheuristics. Our algorithm outperformed the previously published results.",

        "description": "With the rapid development of cloud computing, numerous large-scale workflow are executed in the cloud environment. Therefore, the workflow scheduling in cloud environment has become an emerging topic. This paper focuses on a reliability constrained multi-objective workflow scheduling problem (RCMOWSP) with the objectives of minimum execution cost and time. To solve the RCMOWSP, this paper proposes a knowledge-based multi-objective estimation of distribution algorithm (KMOEDA) with several problem-specific operators. First, an idle time-based decoding scheme is applied to sort the permutation of tasks greedily. In the global search strategy, a probability model is constructed to improve the diversity of population. Based on the problem-specific knowledge, a reliability-aware local search strategy is designed to performs local search around the solutions that violate reliability constraint. An elite enhancement strategy with a task perturbation operator and a resource perturbation operator is introduced to further improve the elite non-dominated solutions in the external archive. A comprehensive experiment is conducted to verify the performance of KMOEDA. The comparative results show that the KMOEDA significantly outperforms several relative multi-objective workflow scheduling approaches in solving the RCMOWSP.",

        "description": "In recent decades, Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) have gained much popularity in the evolutionary computation community for solving optimization problems. Characterized by the use of probabilistic models to represent the solutions and the interactions between the variables of the problem, EDAs can be applied to either discrete, continuous or mixed domain problems. Due to this robustness, these algorithms have been used to solve a diverse set of real-world and academic optimization problems. However, a straightforward application is only limited to a few cases, and for the general case, an efficient application requires intuition from the problem as well as notable understanding in probabilistic modeling. In this paper, we provide a roadmap for solving optimization problems via EDAs. It is not the aim of the paper to provide a thorough review of EDAs, but to present a guide for those practitioners interested in using the potential of EDAs when solving optimization problems. In order to present a roadmap which is as useful as possible, we address the key aspects involved in the design and application of EDAs, in a sequence of stages: (1) the choice of the codification, (2) the choice of the probability model, (3) strategies to incorporate knowledge about the problem to the model, and (4) balancing the diversification-intensification behavior of the EDA. At each stage, first, the contents are presented together with common practices and advice to follow. Then, an illustration is given with an example which shows different alternatives. In addition to the roadmap, the paper presents current open challenges when developing EDAs, and revises paths for future research advances in the context of EDAs.",

Moreover, the task becomes even more complicated since well-known\u00a0trainability\u00a0issues, e.g., barren plateaus (BPs), can occur. In this paper, we aim to achieve two improvements in QAS: (1) to reduce the number\u00a0of\u00a0measurements\u00a0by\u00a0an online\u00a0surrogate\u00a0model\u00a0of\u00a0the evaluation process that aggressively discards architectures\u00a0of\u00a0poor performance; (2) to avoid training the circuits when BPs are present.

Next, we introduce a novel version of GOMEA, called CGOMEA, where linkage-based variation is further improved by filtering solution mating based on conditional dependencies. We compare our latest version of GOMEA, the newly introduced CGOMEA, and another contending linkage-aware EA, DSMGA-II, in an extensive experimental evaluation, involving a benchmark set of nine black-box problems that can be solved efficiently only if their inherent dependency structure is unveiled and exploited. Finally, in an attempt to make EAs more usable and resilient to parameter choices, we investigate the performance of different automatic population management schemes for GOMEA and CGOMEA, de facto making the EAs\u00a0parameterless.

The most common approach is to use genetic algorithms, but defining adequate crossover and mutation operators is challenging for Android testing: The actions that form tests are often state-dependent, which implies that they cannot be arbitrarily re-arranged without leading to non-executable tests. In this paper, we therefore investigate the use of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), which are search algorithms where probability distributions over the input space are adapted and sampled instead of using explicit variation operators. We introduce MIOEDA, a many-objective search algorithm that integrates the Many Objective Independent (MIO) search algorithm, which was specifically designed for test generation, with estimation of distribution search, thus enabling the search for code coverage without requiring classical variation operators. Using our implementation of MIOEDA as part of the open source Android test generator MATE for an evaluation study on 100 Android apps demonstrates that MIOEDA can serve as a successful replacement of search algorithms based on traditional variation operators.",

Given the NP-hard complexity of SCIoT, Evolutionary Computation methods, especially Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs), have received increasing attention to solve SCIoT problems. As one of the most popular EDA methods, Population-Based Incremental Learning (PBIL) has demonstrated its strong competency in optimising composed services in SCIoT. However, conventional PBIL does not explicitly utilize problem knowledge such as QoS and service replication, limiting its effectiveness for IoT service composition. In this paper, we propose a new PBIL based approach, named Population-Based Incremental Learning to Improve Service Composition (PBILISC), to solve the SCIoT problem. Different from traditional PBIL, PBILISC seamlessly integrates PBIL with QoS-aware local search (QLS) to effectively handle replicated services in the SCIoT problem. Specifically, PBILISC evolves a series of populations of solutions jointly through PBIL and QLS. PBIL leverages a probability distribution for population updates, while QLS focuses on improving the best evolved solution by searching promising neighboring solutions under the guidance of QoS. Experimental results show that PBILISC can outperform PBIL and several state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmark SCIoT problems.",

The proposed EMP and control framework are structured around four essential components: (i) Real-time Energy Data Collection: Inexpensive energy meters gather energy data from various renewable sources, VRFBS, utility, and loads, ensuring comprehensive real-time monitoring. (ii) Monitoring and Control: MODBUS on TCP/IP and Raspberry-Pi platforms facilitate monitoring, control, and fault detection, ensuring seamless operation and fault mitigation. (iii) Cloud-Enabled Remote Monitoring: The system employs Message Alignment Telemetry Transference (MATT) servers and ThingSpeak Middleware to establish a Cloud-enabled Remote Monitoring Unit (RMU), enhancing accessibility and remote monitoring capabilities. (iv) Biogas and VRFBS Control: The system measures biogas generation and automates control of biogas engine generators, while enabling scheduled modifications of VRFBS requisition, ensuring optimal energy utilization. An integrated Hybrid Microgrid, comprising a 10 kWP PV system, a 15kVA biogas unit, and a 6 kWh VRFBS, has been designed to efficiently manage energy requisition and prevent power losses during dynamic load profiles. This configuration validates the efficacy of the proposed ICS. The EMP's performance is rigorously evaluated across three distinct scenarios, demonstrating its ability to utilize PV power during daytime outages and support critical loads by connecting biogas power generators during grid outages. The modelled IoT sensors and renewable landscape design within the digital twin simulator enhance the system's predictive capabilities and decision-making processes. This study marks a significant advancement, presenting a cost-effective and versatile solution through Smart Islanded Hybrid Microgrids.

The main idea is applying the process of random forest variable importance with a random grouping that determines some of the best assignment of decision variables to objective functions in order to form a Gaussian process in inverse models that maps to decision space the rich solutions which are discovered from objective space. Then these inverse models through sampling the objective space generate offspring. The proposed algorithm has been tested on the benchmark test suite for evolutionary algorithms (modified Deb K, Thiele L, Laumanns M, Zitzler E (DTLZ), and Walking Fish Group (WFG)) and indicates that the proposed method is a competitive and promising approach.",

        "description": "In Black Box Optimization, traditional Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) are limited by strong prior assumptions. To address this, deep generative model-based EDAs, particularly OPT-GAN using Generative Adversarial Networks, show promise due to their adaptability across diverse problems. However, OPT-GAN's search efficiency and balance between exploration and exploitation remain challenging. This study introduces an improved version of OPT-GAN. By integrating smoothing scale mapping and an adaptive exploration mechanism, it mitigates existing limitations, effectively balancing the E-E trade-off and improving search efficiency. Our experimental results, validated on the COCO benchmark, demonstrate that this improved OPT-GAN outperforms existing neural networkbased optimization algorithms, highlighting its potential for wider application in complex optimization scenarios.",

        "description": "Search-based test generation techniques have shown promising results when applied to Android. The most common approach is to use genetic algorithms, but defining adequate crossover and mutation operators is challenging for Android testing: The actions that form tests are often state-dependent, which implies that they cannot be arbitrarily re-arranged without leading to non-executable tests. In this paper, we therefore investigate the use of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), which are search algorithms where probability distributions over the input space are adapted and sampled instead of using explicit variation operators. We introduce MIOEDA, a many-objective search algorithm that integrates the Many Objective Independent (MIO) search algorithm, which was specifically designed for test generation, with estimation of distribution search, thus enabling the search for code coverage without requiring classical variation operators. Using our implementation of MIOEDA as part of the open source Android test generator MATE for an evaluation study on 100 Android apps demonstrates that MIOEDA can serve as a successful replacement of search algorithms based on traditional variation operators.",

Given the NP-hard complexity of SCIoT, Evolutionary Computation methods, especially Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs), have received increasing attention to solve SCIoT problems. As one of the most popular EDA methods, Population-Based Incremental Learning (PBIL) has demonstrated its strong competency in optimising composed services in SCIoT. However, conventional PBIL does not explicitly utilize problem knowledge such as QoS and service replication, limiting its effectiveness for IoT service composition. In this paper, we propose a new PBIL based approach, named Population-Based Incremental Learning to Improve Service Composition (PBILISC), to solve the SCIoT problem. Different from traditional PBIL, PBILISC seamlessly integrates PBIL with QoS-aware local search (QLS) to effectively handle replicated services in the SCIoT problem. Specifically, PBILISC evolves a series of populations of solutions jointly through PBIL and QLS. PBIL leverages a probability distribution for population updates, while QLS focuses on improving the best evolved solution by searching promising neighboring solutions under the guidance of QoS. Experimental results show that PBILISC can outperform PBIL and several state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmark SCIoT problems.",

The proposed EMP and control framework are structured around four essential components: (i) Real-time Energy Data Collection: Inexpensive energy meters gather energy data from various renewable sources, VRFBS, utility, and loads, ensuring comprehensive real-time monitoring. (ii) Monitoring and Control: MODBUS on TCP/IP and Raspberry-Pi platforms facilitate monitoring, control, and fault detection, ensuring seamless operation and fault mitigation. (iii) Cloud-Enabled Remote Monitoring: The system employs Message Alignment Telemetry Transference (MATT) servers and ThingSpeak Middleware to establish a Cloud-enabled Remote Monitoring Unit (RMU), enhancing accessibility and remote monitoring capabilities. (iv) Biogas and VRFBS Control: The system measures biogas generation and automates control of biogas engine generators, while enabling scheduled modifications of VRFBS requisition, ensuring optimal energy utilization. An integrated Hybrid Microgrid, comprising a 10 kWP PV system, a 15kVA biogas unit, and a 6 kWh VRFBS, has been designed to efficiently manage energy requisition and prevent power losses during dynamic load profiles. This configuration validates the efficacy of the proposed ICS. The EMP's performance is rigorously evaluated across three distinct scenarios, demonstrating its ability to utilize PV power during daytime outages and support critical loads by connecting biogas power generators during grid outages. The modelled IoT sensors and renewable landscape design within the digital twin simulator enhance the system's predictive capabilities and decision-making processes. This study marks a significant advancement, presenting a cost-effective and versatile solution through Smart Islanded Hybrid Microgrids.

These explanations answer the question of which change is needed in the input data to obtain a desired output. Computing good counterfactuals involves achieving some key objectives, such as validity, minimality, similarity or plausibility. Our proposal consists of using estimation of distribution algorithms for approximating counterfactual explanations within Bayesian classifiers. They are experimentally compared with a genetic algorithm, both with a single-objective and with a multi-objective formulation. Different types of Bayesian classifiers will be evaluated to find the differences in their explanations and we will use their results together to provide more accurate explanations. The experiments show how estimation of distribution algorithms are faster and achieve better results with a single-objective whereas they are competitive in the multi-objective version.",

Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDA), based on probabilistic modelling, have been proved to obtain good results in problems where genetic algorithms struggle. In this paper we propose to adapt three EDAs to tackle the multi-objective NRP in a fast and effective way. Results show that EDAs can be applicable to solve the NRP with rather good quality of solutions. Furthermore, we prove that their execution time can be significantly reduced using a per-iteration solution subset selection method while maintaining the overall quality of the solutions obtained, and they perform the best when limiting the search time as in an interactive tool that requires fast responsiveness.
