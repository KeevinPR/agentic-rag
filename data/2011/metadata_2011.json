        "description": "In this paper, we report a novel evolutionary algorithm that enhances its performance by utilizing the entire previous search history. The proposed algorithm, namely history driven evolutionary algorithm (HdEA), employs a binary space partitioning tree structure to memorize the positions and the fitness values of the evaluated solutions. Benefiting from the space partitioning scheme, a fast fitness function approximation using the archive is obtained. The approximation is used to improve the mutation strategy in HdEA. The resultant mutation operator is parameter-less, anisotropic, and adaptive. Moreover, the mutation operator naturally avoids the generation of out-of-bound solutions. The performance of HdEA is tested on 34 benchmark functions with dimensions ranging from 2 to 40. We also provide a performance comparison of HdEA with eight benchmark evolutionary algorithms, including a real coded genetic algorithm, differential evolution, two improved differential evolution, covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy, two improved particle swarm optimization, and an estimation of distribution algorithm. Seen from the experimental results, HdEA outperforms the other algorithms for multimodal function optimization.",

The metabolite data were processed by L-EDA to discover potential EOC prognosis biomarkers. After L-EDA filtration, 78 out of 714 variables were selected, and the relationships among four groups were visualized by principle component analysis, it was observed that with the L-EDA filtered variables, non-recurrent EOC and recurrent EOC groups could be separated, which was not possible with the initial data. Five metabolites (six variables) with P &lt; 0.05 in Wilcoxon test were discovered as potential EOC prognosis biomarkers, and their classification accuracy rates were 86.9% for recurrent EOC and non-recurrent EOC, and 88.7% for healthy + non-recurrent EOC and EOC + recurrent EOC.

        "description": "Unconstrained binary quadratic programming problem (UBQP) consists in maximizing a quadratic 0-1 function. It is a well known NP-hard problem and is considered as a unified model for a variety of combinatorial optimization problems. This paper combines a tabu Hopfield neural network (HNN) (THNN) with estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA), and thus a THNN-EDA is proposed for the UBQP. In the THNN, the tabu rule, instead of the original updating rule of the HNN, is used to govern the state transition or updating of neurons to search for the global minimum of the energy function. A probability vector in EDA model is built to characterize the distribution of promising solutions in the search space, and then the THNN is guided by the global search information in EDA model to search better solution in the promising region. Thus, the short term memory of the tabu mechanism in the THNN cooperates with the long term memory mechanism in the EDA to help the network escape from local minima. The THNN-EDA is tested on 21 UBQP benchmark problems with the size ranging from 3000 to 7000, and 48 maximum cut benchmark problems, a special case of the UBQP, with the size ranging from 512 to 3375. Simulation results show that the THNN-EDA is better than the other HNN based algorithms, and is better than or competitive with metaheuristic algorithms and state-of-the-art algorithms.

The numerical results allow us to conclude the following: 1) the IDRR impacts the complexity of the problem, i.e. the larger the IDRR the easier the optimization. 2) linear entropic mutation improves the performance of the algorithms and reduces the population size requirements. 3) the independence model seems to be adequate for very large IDRR but fails dramatically for the other cases.",

Iterated greedy algorithms are comprised of local search procedures based on insertion and swap neighborhood structures. In the same context, we also consider a discrete differential evolution algorithm from our previous work. The performance of the proposed algorithms is tested on the well-known benchmark suite of Taillard. The highly effective performance of the discrete artificial bee colony and hybrid differential evolution algorithms is compared against the best performing algorithms from the existing literature in terms of both solution quality and CPU times. Ultimately, 44 out of the 90 best known solutions provided very recently by the best performing estimation of distribution and genetic local search algorithms are further improved by the proposed algorithms with short-term searches.

        "description": "This paper studies the application of evolutionary algorithms for bi-objective travelling salesman problem. Two evolutionary algorithms, including estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) and genetic algorithm (GA), are considered. The solution to this problem is a set of trade-off alternatives. The problem is solved by optimizing the order of the cities so as to simultaneously minimize the two objectives of travelling distance and travelling cost incurred by the travelling salesman. In this paper, binary-representation-based evolutionary algorithms are replaced with an integer-representation. Three existing EDAs are altered to use this integer-representation, namely restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), univariate marginal distribution algorithm (UMDA), and population-based incremental learning (PBIL). Each city is associated with a representative integer, and the probability of any of this representative integer to be located in any position of the chromosome is constructed through the modeling approach of the EDAs. New sequences of cities are obtained by sampling from the probabilistic model. A refinement operator and a local search operator are proposed in this piece of work. The EDAs are subsequently hybridized with GA in order to complement the limitations of both algorithms. The effect that each of these operators has on the quality of the solutions are investigated. Empirical results show that the hybrid algorithms are capable of finding a set of good trade-off solutions.",

        "description": "An Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA), which depends on explicitly sampling mechanisms based on probabilistic models with information extracted from the parental solutions to generate new solutions, has constituted one of the major research areas in the field of evolutionary computation. The fact that no genetic operators are used in EDAs is a major characteristic differentiating EDAs from other genetic algorithms (GAs). This advantage, however, could lead to premature convergence of EDAs as the probabilistic models are no longer generating diversified solutions. In our previous research [1], we have presented the evidences that EDAs suffer from the drawback of premature convergency, thus several important guidelines are provided for the design of effective EDAs. In this paper, we validated one guideline for incorporating other meta-heuristics into the EDAs. An algorithm named \"EA/G-GA\" is proposed by selecting a well-known EDA, EA/G, to work with GAs. The proposed algorithm was tested on the NP-Hard single machine scheduling problems with the total weighted earliness/tardiness cost in a just-in-time environment. The experimental results indicated that the EA/G-GA outperforms the compared algorithms statistically significantly across different stopping criteria and demonstrated the robustness of the proposed algorithm. Consequently, this paper is of interest and importance in the field of EDAs.",

First, to compensate for the absence of recombination among different antibodies, an EDA vaccination is designed and incorporated into CSA. Second, to keep the diversity of the population, a fitness uniform selection scheme (FUSS) is adopted as a selection operator. Third, to enhance the exploitation ability of CSA, an adaptive tabu search (TS) with feedback mechanism is introduced. Thus, MCSA-EDA can overcome the deficiencies of CSA and further search better solutions. MCSA-EDA is tested on a series of UBQP with size up to 7000 variables. Simulation results show that MCSA-EDA is effective for improving the performance of the conventional CSA and is better than or at least competitive with other existing metaheuristic algorithms.

In order to draw full power, it is possible to flatten the power in fresh core by loading some depleted uranium (DU) (or Thorium) bundles. The determination of the best possible locations of DU bundles which maximize economy and preserve safety is a constrained combinatorial optimization problem. This paper presents optimization of DU bundle distribution in the fresh core of the 700 MWe PHWR. An evolutionary technique based on Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) is used to determine the optimum DU loading pattern. The best suitable locations for DU bundles are determined using EDA. In order to meet some additional constraints, some additional DU bundles are placed at 11th and 12th bundle locations in few channels. These channels are selected manually. The overall aim of the optimization is to maximize K-effective and get 100% full power without violating safety parameters such as maximum permissible bundle power, channel power peaking factor and permitted reactivity worth in shut-down system.

Also, the intelligence of the particles is totally neglected by the canonical PSO and most of other literatures. To tackle such problems, we propose to enable the sharing of information from the collective experience of the swarm by hybridizing an EDA operator with PSO and to add the primitive intelligence to each particle by using a local search mechanism. To enhance the performance of the algorithm proposed, a new local search algorithm, the minimization-of-waiting-time local search (MWL), is applied.

        "description": "Recently, the minimum error entropy criterion, an information theoretic alternative to the traditional mean square error criterion, has been successfully used in the contexts of machine learning and signal processing. For system identification, however, the MEE criterion will be no longer suitable if the training data are discrete-valued, since minimizing error's discrete entropy cannot constrain error's dispersion. In this paper, to make the MEE criterion suitable for the discrete-valued data cases, we give a new entropy definition for the discrete random variables, i.e. the Delta-entropy, based on Riemann sums for finite size partitions. A probability weighted formula is established to calculate the average partition. This new entropy retains some important properties of the differential entropy and reduces to discrete entropy under certain conditions. Unlike discrete entropy, the Delta-entropy is sensitive to the dynamic range of the data, and can be used as a superior optimality criterion in system identification problems. Also, we present a plug-in estimate of Delta-entropy, analyze its asymptotic behavior and explore the links to the kernel based and m-spacing based estimates for differential entropy. Finally, the Delta-entropy criterion is applied in system identification with coarsely quantized input-output data to search for the optimum parameter set. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the performance improvement that may be achieved with the Delta-entropy criterion. Published by Elsevier Inc.",

In each generation, the probabilistic model parameters will be estimated by training the model on a set of selected individuals and new individuals are then sampled from the probabilistic model. In this paper, we propose to use probabilistic models in a different way: firstly generate a set of candidate points, then find some as offspring solutions by a filter which is based on a nonparametric density estimation method. Based on this idea, we propose a nonparametric estimation of distribution algorithm (nEDA) for global optimization. The major differences between nEDA and traditional EDAs are (1) nEDA uses a generating-filtering strategy to create new solutions while traditional EDAs use a model building-sampling strategy to generate solutions, and (2) nEDA utilizes a nonparametric density model with traditional EDAs usually utilize parametric density models. nEDA is compared with a traditional EDA which is based on Gaussian model on a set of benchmark problems.

        "description": "Detecting multivariate interactions between the variables of a problem is a challenge in traditional genetic algorithms (GAs). This issue has been addressed in the literature as the linkage learning problem. It is widely acknowledged that the success of GA in solving any problem depends on the proper detection of multivariate interactions in the problem. Different approaches have thus been proposed to detect and represent such interactions. Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) are amongst these approaches that have been successfully applied to a wide range of hard optimization problems. They build a model of the problem to detect multivariate interactions, but the model building process is often computationally intensive. In this paper, we propose a new clustering algorithm that turns pair-wise interactions in a dependency structure matrix (DSM) into an interaction model efficiently. The model building process is carried out before the evolutionary algorithm to save computational burden. The accurate interaction model obtained in this way is then used to perform an effective recombination of building blocks (BBs) in the GA. We applied the proposed approach to solve exemplar hard optimization problems with different types of linkages to show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach. Theoretical analysis and experiments showed that the building of an accurate model requires O(n log(n)) number of fitness evaluations. The comparison of the proposed approach with some existing algorithms revealed that the efficiency of the model building process is enhanced significantly.",

Subsequently, GAIS utilizes this probabilistic model for sampling new solutions. Thus, the algorithm takes into account the relationships among the variables of the problem, avoiding the disruption of already obtained high-quality partial solutions (building blocks). Besides the capability to identify and manipulate building blocks, the algorithm maintains diversity in the population, performs multimodal optimization and adjusts the size of the population automatically according to the problem. These attributes are generally absent from alternative algorithms, and all were shown to be useful attributes when optimizing the weights of MLPs, thus guiding to high-performance classifiers.

Upper bounds are derived via a bandit-based estimation of distribution algorithm that relies on Bernstein races called R-EDA. It is an evolutionary algorithm in the sense that it is based on selection, random mutations, with a distribution (updated at each iteration) for generating new individuals. It is known that the algorithm is consistent (i.e. it converges to the optimum asymptotically in the number of examples) even in some non-differentiable cases. Here we show that: (i) if the variance of the noise decreases to 0 around the optimum, it can perform well for quadratic transformations of the norm to the optimum, (ii) otherwise, a convergence rate is slower than the one exhibited empirically by an algorithm called Quadratic Logistic Regression (QLR) based on surrogate models-although QLR requires a probabilistic prior on the fitness class.",

This is because one variable may be dependent on another variable and all variables may have different saliences even if they are independent. Therefore, only a subset of all variables in EDAs really function at each generation.|This paper proposes a novel class of EDAs, termed as subspace estimation of distribution algorithms (subEDAs), from a new perspective to reduce the space of variables for use in model building and model sampling based on EDAs' performance. In subEDAs, only part of all variables of candidate individuals are perturbed at each generation. Three schemes are described in details to determine which variables should be perturbed at each generation: the random picking method (RP), the majority voting based on the similarity between high quality individuals (MVSH) and the majority voting based on the difference between high quality and low quality individuals (MVDHL). Then, subEDAs + RP, subEDAs + MVSH and subEDAs + MVDHL are tested on several benchmark functions and their algorithmic results are compared with those obtained by EDAs. Our experimental results indicate that subEDAs are able to obtain a comparative result using only a subset of problem variables in the model when compared with traditional EDAs. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.

        "description": "In this paper we present a geometrical framework for the analysis of Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) based on the exponential family. From a theoretical point of view, an EDA can be modeled as a sequence of densities in a statistical model that converges towards distributions with reduced support. Under this framework, at each iteration the empirical mean of the fitness function decreases in probability, until convergence of the population. This is the context of stochastic relaxation, i.e., the idea of looking for the minima of a function by minimizing its expected value over a set of probability densities. Our main interest is in the study of the gradient of the expected value of the function to be minimized, and in particular on how its landscape changes according to the fitness function and the statistical model used in the relaxation. After introducing some properties of the exponential family, such as the description of its topological closure and of its tangent space, we provide a characterization of the stationary points of the relaxed problem, together with a study of the minimizing sequences with reduced support. The analysis developed in the paper aims to provide a theoretical understanding of the behavior of EDAs, and in particular their ability to converge to the global minimum of the fitness function. The theoretical results of this paper, beside providing a formal framework for the analysis of EDAs, lead to the definition of a new class algorithms for binary functions optimization based on Stochastic Natural Gradient Descent (SNGD), where the estimation of the parameters of the distribution is replaced by the direct update of the model parameters by estimating the natural gradient of the expected value of the fitness function.",

If an error is detected, the precise circumstances of the issue are returned to the user in the form of a counterexample. Exhaustively checking the state space of a large system, a system with many concurrent components for example, is often intractable. In this scenario, heuristic mechanisms can be employed with the task of detecting errors rather than proving the system is correct. Recently, a metaheuristic EDA-based approach to detecting deadlock in multithreaded Java software has shown great promise in this area. In this paper, we extend that work to search Promela models for counterexamples. We show that the EDA-based technique can find errors where algorithms such as A* search fail. We also show the ability of the EDA to find shorter errors than those discovered by traditional heuristic methods.",

In order to study the ability limit of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), this paper experimentally tests three different EDA implementations on a sequence of additively decomposable functions (ADFs) with an increasing number of interactions among binary variables. The results show that the ability of EDAs to solve problems could be lost immediately when the degree of variable interaction is larger than a threshold. We argue that this phase-transition phenomenon is closely related with the computational restrictions imposed in the learning step of this type of algorithms. Moreover, we demonstrate how the use of unrestricted Bayesian networks rapidly becomes inefficient as the number of sub-functions in an ADF increases. The study conducted in this paper is useful in order to identify patterns of behavior in EDAs and, thus, improve their performances.",

The analysis performed can yield insights into the target problem allowing practitioners to adjust parameters of the algorithm or indeed the algorithm itself. This can lead to a saving in the effort required to perform future executions, which is particularly important when targeting expensive fitness functions such as searching concurrent software state spaces. In this work, we describe practical scenarios related to detecting concurrent faults in which reusing information discovered in EDA runs can save effort in future runs, and prove the potential of such reuse using an example scenario. The example scenario consists of examining problem families, and we provide empirical evidence showing real effort saving properties for three such families.",

The data profiles they produce are noisy and unstable. In these profiles, biomarkers are detected as signal regions (peaks), where control and disease samples behave differently. Mass spectrometry (MS) data generally contain a limited number of samples described by a high number of features. In this work, we present a novel class of evolutionary algorithms, estimation of distribution algorithms (EDA), as an efficient peak selector in this MS domain. There is a trade-of f between the reliability of the detected biomarkers and the low number of samples for analysis. For this reason, we introduce a consensus approach, built upon the classical EDA scheme, that improves stability and robustness of the final set of relevant peaks. An entire data workflow is designed to yield unbiased results. Four publicly available MS data sets (two MALDI-TOF and another two SELDI-TOF) are analyzed.

From this standpoint, estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), which guide the search by using probabilistic models of the population, have brought a new view to evolutionary computation. While solving a given problem with an EDA, the user has access to a set of models that reveal probabilistic dependencies between variables, an important source of information about the problem. However, as the complexity of the used models increases, the chance of overfitting and consequently reducing model interpretability, increases as well. This paper investigates the relationship between the probabilistic models learned by the Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA) and the underlying problem structure. The purpose of the paper is threefold. First, model building in BOA is analyzed to understand how the problem structure is learned. Second, it is shown how the selection operator can lead to model overfitting in Bayesian EDAs. Third, the scoring metric that guides the search for an adequate model structure is modified to take into account the non-uniform distribution of the mating pool generated by tournament selection. Overall, this paper makes a contribution towards understanding and improving model accuracy in BOA, providing more interpretable models to assist efficiency enhancement techniques and human researchers.",

The contribution of this paper is a comparison of various adaptive and self-adaptive variance scaling techniques for a Gaussian EDA. The analysis includes: (1) the Gaussian EDA without scaling, but different selection pressures and population sizes, (2) the variance adaptation technique known as Silverman's rule-of-thumb, (3) sigma-self-adaptation known from evolution strategies, and (4) transformation of the solution space by estimation of the Hessian. We discuss the results for the sphere function, and its constrained counterpart.",

Thus the quality of these samples is context-sensitive and the algorithms assume low linkage among their variables. This results in well-known difficulties with these methods. While EDAs have commonly overcome these difficulties by examining multivariate linkage, CCEAs have instead examined basing the fitness of each marginal sample on the maximum of several trials. In this study we examine whether multiple-trial CCEA approach is really effective for difficult problems and large numbers of subpopulations; and whether this approach can be used to improve Univariate EDAs as well.",

The goal of evolution is to find the best compositions and weights of hyperedges to estimate the underlying distribution of the target concepts. We discuss the relationship of this method with estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), classifier systems, and ensemble learning methods. We evaluate the method on a suite of image/text benchmarks. The experimental results demonstrate that the evolutionary process successfully discovers salient codewords representing multi-modal feature combinations for describing and distinguishing different concepts.

Conventional EDAs use only one single model at a time. One way to efficiently explore multiple areas of the search space is to use multiple models in parallel. In this paper, we present a general framework for both single- and multi-model EDAs. We propose the use of clustering to divide selected individuals into different groups, which are then utilized to build separate models. For the multi-model case, we introduce the concept of model recombination. This novel framework has great generality, encompassing the traditional Evolutionary Algorithm and the EDA as its extreme cases. We instantiate our framework in the form of a real-valued algorithm and apply this algorithm to some well-known benchmark functions. Numerical results show that both single- and multi-model EDAs have their own strengths and weaknesses, and that the multi-model EDA is able to prevent premature convergence.",

On account of this property of the EDA, our proposed algorithm also exhibits a powerful global search capability. In addition, the possible infeasible solutions generated during the re-sampling period of the EDA are eliminated by the HNN. Therefore, the merits of both these methods are combined in a unified framework. The proposed model is tested on a numerical example, the max-cut problem. The new and optimized model yielded a better performance than certain traditional intelligent optimization methods, such as HNN, genetic algorithm (GA). The proposed mutation Hopfield neural network (MHNN) is also used to solve a practical problem, aircraft landing scheduling (ALS).

The choice of the model plays a key role in the evolutionary process, indeed it strongly affects the convergence to the global optimum. From this point of view, in a black-box context, especially when the interactions among variables in the objective function are sparse, it becomes fundamental for an EDA to choose the right model, able to encode such correlations. In this paper we focus on EDAs based on undirected graphical models, such as Markov Networks. To learn the topology of the graph we apply a sparse method based on l(1)-regularized logistic regression, which has been demonstrated to be efficient in the high-dimensional case, i.e., when the number of observations is much smaller than the sample space. We propose a new algorithm within the DEUM framework, called DEUMl1, able to learn the interactions structure of the problem without the need of prior knowledge, and we compare its performance with other popular EDAs, over a set of well known benchmarks.",

        "description": "Artificial chromosomes with genetic algorithm (ACGA) is one of the latest Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs). This algorithm has been used to solve different kinds of scheduling problems successfully. However, due to its probabilistic model does not consider the variable interactions, ACGA may not perform well in some scheduling problems, particularly the sequence-dependent setup times are considered because a former job influences the processing time of next job. It is not sufficient that probabilistic model just captures the ordinal information from parental distribution. As a result, this paper proposes a bi-variate probabilistic model added into the ACGA. The new algorithm is named extended artificial chromosomes with genetic algorithm (eACGA) and it is used to solve single machine scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setup times in a common due-date environment. Some heuristics are also employed with eACGA. The results indicate that the average error ratio of eACGA is one-half of the ACGA. In addition, when eACGA works with other heuristics, the hybrid algorithm achieves the best solution quality when it is compared with other algorithms in literature. Thus, the proposed algorithms are effective for solving this scheduling problem with setup consideration.",

Different algorithms fit this framework, and they differ according to the policy they implement to identify the next distribution in the model. In this paper we present two algorithms, in the stochastic relaxation framework, for the optimization of real-valued functions defined over binary variables: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Stochastic Natural Gradient Descent (SNDG). These algorithms use a stochastic model to sample from as it happens for Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs), but the estimation of the model from the population is substituted by the direct update of model parameter through stochastic gradient descent. The two algorithms, SGD and SNDG, both use statistical models in the exponential family, but they differ in the use of the natural gradient, first proposed in the literature by Amari [5], in the context of Information Geometry. Due to the properties of the exponential family, both gradient and natural gradient can be evaluated in terms of covariances between the fitness function and the sufficient statistics of the exponential family. As the computation of the exact gradient is unfeasible, we approximate the gradient by evaluating empirical covariances. We test the performance of our algorithm over different standard benchmarks, and we compare the results with other well-known meta-heuristics in the framework of EDAs.",

        "description": "An evolutionary algorithm with guided mutation (EA/G) has been proposed recently for solving the maximum clique problem. In the framework of estimation-of-distribution algorithms, guided mutation uses a model distribution to generate offspring by combining the local information of solutions found so far with global statistical information. Each individual is then subjected to a Marchiori's repair heuristic, based on randomized extraction and greedy expansion, to ensure that it represents a legal clique. A novel reactive and evolutionary algorithm (R-EVO) proposed in this paper starts from the same evolutionary framework but considers more complex individuals, which modify tentative solutions by local search with memory, according to the reactive search optimization (RSO) principles. In particular, the estimated distribution is used to periodically initialize the state of each individual based on the previous statistical knowledge extracted from the population. We demonstrate that the combination of the estimation-of-distribution concept with RSO produces significantly better results than EA/G for many test instances and it is remarkably robust with respect to the setting of the algorithm parameters. R-EVO adopts a drastically simplified low-knowledge version of reactive local search (RLS), with a simple internal diversification mechanism based on tabu-search, with a prohibition parameter proportional to the estimated best clique size. R-EVO is competitive with the more complex full-knowledge RLS-EVO that adopts the original RLS algorithm. For most of the benchmark instances, the hybrid scheme version produces significantly better results than EA/G for comparable or a smaller central processing unit time.",

One of the main advantages of the EDAs over other optimization algorithms is that the former provides a trail of probabilistic models of candidate solutions with increasing quality. Some recent studies have applied these probabilistic models, obtained from previously solved problems in biasing the BOA algorithm, to solve the future problems. In this paper, in order to improve the previous works and reduce their disadvantages, a method based on Case Based Reasoning (CBR) is proposed for biasing the BOA algorithm. Herein, after running BOA for solving optimization problems, each problem, the corresponding solution, as well as the last Bayesian network obtained from the BOA algorithm, will be stored as an entry in the case-base. Upon introducing a new problem, similar problems from the case-base are retrieved and the last Bayesian networks of these solved problems are combined according to the degree of their similarity with the new problem; hence, a compound Bayesian network is constructed. The compound Bayesian network is sampled and the initial population for the BOA algorithm is generated. This network will be applied efficiently for biasing future probabilistic models during the runs of BOA for the new problem. The proposed method is tested on three well-known combinatorial benchmark problems. Experimental results show significant improvements in algorithm execution time and quality of solutions, compared to previous methods. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

However, it may be unnecessary for the EDAs to perturb all variables of candidate individuals at each generation. This is because one variable may be dependent on another variable and all variables may have different saliences even if they are independent. Therefore, only a subset of all variables in EDAs really function at each generation.|This paper proposes a novel class of EDAs, termed as subspace estimation of distribution algorithms (subEDAs), from a new perspective to reduce the space of variables for use in model building and model sampling based on EDAs' performance. In subEDAs, only part of all variables of candidate individuals are perturbed at each generation. Three schemes are described in details to determine which variables should be perturbed at each generation: the random picking method (RP), the majority voting based on the similarity between high quality individuals (MVSH) and the majority voting based on the difference between high quality and low quality individuals (MVDHL). Then, subEDAs + RP, subEDAs + MVSH and subEDAs + MVDHL are tested on several benchmark functions and their algorithmic results are compared with those obtained by EDAs. Our experimental results indicate that subEDAs are able to obtain a comparative result using only a subset of problem variables in the model when compared with traditional EDAs. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.

From a theoretical point of view, an EDA can be modeled as a sequence of densities in a statistical model that converges towards distributions with reduced support. Under this framework, at each iteration the empirical mean of the fitness function decreases in probability, until convergence of the population. This is the context of stochastic relaxation, i.e., the idea of looking for the minima of a function by minimizing its expected value over a set of probability densities. Our main interest is in the study of the gradient of the expected value of the function to be minimized, and in particular on how its landscape changes according to the fitness function and the statistical model used in the relaxation. After introducing some properties of the exponential family, such as the description of its topological closure and of its tangent space, we provide a characterization of the stationary points of the relaxed problem, together with a study of the minimizing sequences with reduced support. The analysis developed in the paper aims to provide a theoretical understanding of the behavior of EDAs, and in particular their ability to converge to the global minimum of the fitness function. The theoretical results of this paper, beside providing a formal framework for the analysis of EDAs, lead to the definition of a new class algorithms for binary functions optimization based on Stochastic Natural Gradient Descent (SNGD), where the estimation of the parameters of the distribution is replaced by the direct update of the model parameters by estimating the natural gradient of the expected value of the fitness function.",

The results show that the ability of EDAs to solve problems could be lost immediately when the degree of variable interaction is larger than a threshold. We argue that this phase-transition phenomenon is closely related with the computational restrictions imposed in the learning step of this type of algorithms.

This can lead to a saving in the effort required to perform future executions, which is particularly important when targeting expensive fitness functions such as searching concurrent software state spaces.

The scalar algorithm performs poorly, but the vectorial version shows good overall performance. We then extended Daida's problem to explore the vectorial algorithm's ability to find even more specific structures, finding that the performance fell off rapidly as the specificity of the required structure increased.

An empirical comparison on 3 decomposable functions, each with uniformly scaled building blocks of size 5 and 8, was carried out. The algorithm exhibits quadratic scaling with the problem dimensionality, but the comparison with the extended compact genetic algorithm and Bayesian optimization algorithm shows that it needs lower or comparable number of fitness function evaluations on the majority of functions for the tested problem dimensionalities.

From this standpoint, estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), which guide the search by using probabilistic models of the population, have brought a new view to evolutionary computation. While solving a given problem with an EDA, the user has access to a set of models that reveal probabilistic dependencies between variables, an important source of information about the problem. However, as the complexity of the used models increases, the chance of overfitting and consequently reducing model interpretability, increases as well. This paper investigates the relationship between the probabilistic models learned by the Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA) and the underlying problem structure. The purpose of the paper is threefold. First, model building in BOA is analyzed to understand how the problem structure is learned. Second, it is shown how the selection operator can lead to model overfitting in Bayesian EDAs. Third, the scoring metric that guides the search for an adequate model structure is modified to take into account the non-uniform distribution of the mating pool generated by tournament selection. Overall, this paper makes a contribution towards understanding and improving model accuracy in BOA, providing more interpretable models to assist efficiency enhancement techniques and human researchers.",

Performance is first tested against IB and SB competitors on synthetic datasets. Against IB competitors (GSMN algorithm and a version of the HHC algorithm adapted here for Markov networks discovery), IBMAP-HC showed reductions in edges Hamming distance with same order running times. Against SB competitors, both IBMAP-HC and our adaptation of HHC produced comparable Hamming distances, but with running times orders of magnitude faster. We also evaluated IBMAP-HC in a realistic, challenging testbed: EDAs, evolutionary algorithms for optimization that estimate a distribution on each generation.

The choice of the model plays a key role in the evolutionary process, indeed it strongly affects the convergence to the global optimum. From this point of view, in a black-box context, especially when the interactions among variables in the objective function are sparse, it becomes fundamental for an EDA to choose the right model, able to encode such correlations. In this paper we focus on EDAs based on undirected graphical models, such as Markov Networks. To learn the topology of the graph we apply a sparse method based on l(1)-regularized logistic regression, which has been demonstrated to be efficient in the high-dimensional case, i.e., when the number of observations is much smaller than the sample space.

However, due to its probabilistic model does not consider the variable interactions, ACGA may not perform well in some scheduling problems, particularly the sequence-dependent setup times are considered because a former job influences the processing time of next job. It is not sufficient that probabilistic model just captures the ordinal information from parental distribution. As a result, this paper proposes a bi-variate probabilistic model added into the ACGA. The new algorithm is named extended artificial chromosomes with genetic algorithm (eACGA) and it is used to solve single machine scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setup times in a common due-date environment. Some heuristics are also employed with eACGA. The results indicate that the average error ratio of eACGA is one-half of the ACGA. In addition, when eACGA works with other heuristics, the hybrid algorithm achieves the best solution quality when it is compared with other algorithms in literature.

In this paper we present two algorithms, in the stochastic relaxation framework, for the optimization of real-valued functions defined over binary variables: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Stochastic Natural Gradient Descent (SNDG). These algorithms use a stochastic model to sample from as it happens for Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs), but the estimation of the model from the population is substituted by the direct update of model parameter through stochastic gradient descent. The two algorithms, SGD and SNDG, both use statistical models in the exponential family, but they differ in the use of the natural gradient, first proposed in the literature by Amari [5], in the context of Information Geometry. Due to the properties of the exponential family, both gradient and natural gradient can be evaluated in terms of covariances between the fitness function and the sufficient statistics of the exponential family. As the computation of the exact gradient is unfeasible, we approximate the gradient by evaluating empirical covariances. We test the performance of our algorithm over different standard benchmarks, and we compare the results with other well-known meta-heuristics in the framework of EDAs.",

        "description": "An evolutionary algorithm with guided mutation (EA/G) has been proposed recently for solving the maximum clique problem. In the framework of estimation-of-distribution algorithms, guided mutation uses a model distribution to generate offspring by combining the local information of solutions found so far with global statistical information. Each individual is then subjected to a Marchiori's repair heuristic, based on randomized extraction and greedy expansion, to ensure that it represents a legal clique. A novel reactive and evolutionary algorithm (R-EVO) proposed in this paper starts from the same evolutionary framework but considers more complex individuals, which modify tentative solutions by local search with memory, according to the reactive search optimization (RSO) principles. In particular, the estimated distribution is used to periodically initialize the state of each individual based on the previous statistical knowledge extracted from the population. We demonstrate that the combination of the estimation-of-distribution concept with RSO produces significantly better results than EA/G for many test instances and it is remarkably robust with respect to the setting of the algorithm parameters. R-EVO adopts a drastically simplified low-knowledge version of reactive local search (RLS), with a simple internal diversification mechanism based on tabu-search, with a prohibition parameter proportional to the estimated best clique size. R-EVO is competitive with the more complex full-knowledge RLS-EVO that adopts the original RLS algorithm. For most of the benchmark instances, the hybrid scheme version produces significantly better results than EA/G for comparable or a smaller central processing unit time.",

One of the main advantages of the EDAs over other optimization algorithms is that the former provides a trail of probabilistic models of candidate solutions with increasing quality. Some recent studies have applied these probabilistic models, obtained from previously solved problems in biasing the BOA algorithm, to solve the future problems. In this paper, in order to improve the previous works and reduce their disadvantages, a method based on Case Based Reasoning (CBR) is proposed for biasing the BOA algorithm. Herein, after running BOA for solving optimization problems, each problem, the corresponding solution, as well as the last Bayesian network obtained from the BOA algorithm, will be stored as an entry in the case-base. Upon introducing a new problem, similar problems from the case-base are retrieved and the last Bayesian networks of these solved problems are combined according to the degree of their similarity with the new problem; hence, a compound Bayesian network is constructed. The compound Bayesian network is sampled and the initial population for the BOA algorithm is generated. This network will be applied efficiently for biasing future probabilistic models during the runs of BOA for the new problem. The proposed method is tested on three well-known combinatorial benchmark problems. Experimental results show significant improvements in algorithm execution time and quality of solutions, compared to previous methods. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "description": "In the traditional estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), all the variables of candidate individuals are perturbed through sampling from a probability distribution of promising individuals. However, it may be unnecessary for the EDAs to perturb all variables of candidate individuals at each generation. This is because one variable may be dependent on another variable and all variables may have different saliences even if they are independent. Therefore, only a subset of all variables in EDAs really function at each generation.|This paper proposes a novel class of EDAs, termed as subspace estimation of distribution algorithms (subEDAs), from a new perspective to reduce the space of variables for use in model building and model sampling based on EDAs' performance. In subEDAs, only part of all variables of candidate individuals are perturbed at each generation. Three schemes are described in details to determine which variables should be perturbed at each generation: the random picking method (RP), the majority voting based on the similarity between high quality individuals (MVSH) and the majority voting based on the difference between high quality and low quality individuals (MVDHL). Then, subEDAs + RP, subEDAs + MVSH and subEDAs + MVDHL are tested on several benchmark functions and their algorithmic results are compared with those obtained by EDAs. Our experimental results indicate that subEDAs are able to obtain a comparative result using only a subset of problem variables in the model when compared with traditional EDAs. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.

        "description": "In this paper we present a geometrical framework for the analysis of Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) based on the exponential family. From a theoretical point of view, an EDA can be modeled as a sequence of densities in a statistical model that converges towards distributions with reduced support. Under this framework, at each iteration the empirical mean of the fitness function decreases in probability, until convergence of the population. This is the context of stochastic relaxation, i.e., the idea of looking for the minima of a function by minimizing its expected value over a set of probability densities. Our main interest is in the study of the gradient of the expected value of the function to be minimized, and in particular on how its landscape changes according to the fitness function and the statistical model used in the relaxation. After introducing some properties of the exponential family, such as the description of its topological closure and of its tangent space, we provide a characterization of the stationary points of the relaxed problem, together with a study of the minimizing sequences with reduced support. The analysis developed in the paper aims to provide a theoretical understanding of the behavior of EDAs, and in particular their ability to converge to the global minimum of the fitness function. The theoretical results of this paper, beside providing a formal framework for the analysis of EDAs, lead to the definition of a new class algorithms for binary functions optimization based on Stochastic Natural Gradient Descent (SNGD), where the estimation of the parameters of the distribution is replaced by the direct update of the model parameters by estimating the natural gradient of the expected value of the fitness function.",

If an error is detected, the precise circumstances of the issue are returned to the user in the form of a counterexample. Exhaustively checking the state space of a large system, a system with many concurrent components for example, is often intractable. In this scenario, heuristic mechanisms can be employed with the task of detecting errors rather than proving the system is correct. Recently, a metaheuristic EDA-based approach to detecting deadlock in multithreaded Java software has shown great promise in this area. In this paper, we extend that work to search Promela models for counterexamples. We show that the EDA-based technique can find errors where algorithms such as A* search fail.

In order to study the ability limit of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), this paper experimentally tests three different EDA implementations on a sequence of additively decomposable functions (ADFs) with an increasing number of interactions among binary variables. The results show that the ability of EDAs to solve problems could be lost immediately when the degree of variable interaction is larger than a threshold. We argue that this phase-transition phenomenon is closely related with the computational restrictions imposed in the learning step of this type of algorithms. Moreover, we demonstrate how the use of unrestricted Bayesian networks rapidly becomes inefficient as the number of sub-functions in an ADF increases. The study conducted in this paper is useful in order to identify patterns of behavior in EDAs and, thus, improve their performances.",

The analysis performed can yield insights into the target problem allowing practitioners to adjust parameters of the algorithm or indeed the algorithm itself. This can lead to a saving in the effort required to perform future executions, which is particularly important when targeting expensive fitness functions such as searching concurrent software state spaces. In this work, we describe practical scenarios related to detecting concurrent faults in which reusing information discovered in EDA runs can save effort in future runs, and prove the potential of such reuse using an example scenario. The example scenario consists of examining problem families, and we provide empirical evidence showing real effort saving properties for three such families.",

The data profiles they produce are noisy and unstable. In these profiles, biomarkers are detected as signal regions (peaks), where control and disease samples behave differently. Mass spectrometry (MS) data generally contain a limited number of samples described by a high number of features. In this work, we present a novel class of evolutionary algorithms, estimation of distribution algorithms (EDA), as an efficient peak selector in this MS domain. There is a trade-of f between the reliability of the detected biomarkers and the low number of samples for analysis. For this reason, we introduce a consensus approach, built upon the classical EDA scheme, that improves stability and robustness of the final set of relevant peaks. An entire data workflow is designed to yield unbiased results. Four publicly available MS data sets (two MALDI-TOF and another two SELDI-TOF) are analyzed.

From this standpoint, estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), which guide the search by using probabilistic models of the population, have brought a new view to evolutionary computation. While solving a given problem with an EDA, the user has access to a set of models that reveal probabilistic dependencies between variables, an important source of information about the problem. However, as the complexity of the used models increases, the chance of overfitting and consequently reducing model interpretability, increases as well. This paper investigates the relationship between the probabilistic models learned by the Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA) and the underlying problem structure. The purpose of the paper is threefold. First, model building in BOA is analyzed to understand how the problem structure is learned. Second, it is shown how the selection operator can lead to model overfitting in Bayesian EDAs. Third, the scoring metric that guides the search for an adequate model structure is modified to take into account the non-uniform distribution of the mating pool generated by tournament selection. Overall, this paper makes a contribution towards understanding and improving model accuracy in BOA, providing more interpretable models to assist efficiency enhancement techniques and human researchers.",

Recently, the hybridization of PSO and EDAs is emerged as a new research trend. In this paper, we introduce a new hybrid approach that uses a mixture of Gaussian distributions. The obtained algorithm, called PSEDA, can be seen as an implementation of the PSO behaviour in the EDAs framework. Experiments on well known benchmark functions have been held and the performances of PSEDA are compared with those of classical PSO.",

It turns out that the success of EDAs in numerical optimization strongly depends on scaling of the variance. The contribution of this paper is a comparison of various adaptive and self-adaptive variance scaling techniques for a Gaussian EDA. The analysis includes: (1) the Gaussian EDA without scaling, but different selection pressures and population sizes, (2) the variance adaptation technique known as Silverman's rule-of-thumb, (3) sigma-self-adaptation known from evolution strategies, and (4) transformation of the solution space by estimation of the Hessian.

Thus the quality of these samples is context-sensitive and the algorithms assume low linkage among their variables. This results in well-known difficulties with these methods. While EDAs have commonly overcome these difficulties by examining multivariate linkage, CCEAs have instead examined basing the fitness of each marginal sample on the maximum of several trials. In this study we examine whether multiple-trial CCEA approach is really effective for difficult problems and large numbers of subpopulations; and whether this approach can be used to improve Univariate EDAs as well.",

The goal of evolution is to find the best compositions and weights of hyperedges to estimate the underlying distribution of the target concepts. We discuss the relationship of this method with estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), classifier systems, and ensemble learning methods. We evaluate the method on a suite of image/text benchmarks. The experimental results demonstrate that the evolutionary process successfully discovers salient codewords representing multi-modal feature combinations for describing and distinguishing different concepts.

Conventional EDAs use only one single model at a time. One way to efficiently explore multiple areas of the search space is to use multiple models in parallel. In this paper, we present a general framework for both single- and multi-model EDAs. We propose the use of clustering to divide selected individuals into different groups, which are then utilized to build separate models. For the multi-model case, we introduce the concept of model recombination. This novel framework has great generality, encompassing the traditional Evolutionary Algorithm and the EDA as its extreme cases. We instantiate our framework in the form of a real-valued algorithm and apply this algorithm to some well-known benchmark functions. Numerical results show that both single- and multi-model EDAs have their own strengths and weaknesses, and that the multi-model EDA is able to prevent premature convergence.",

On account of this property of the EDA, our proposed algorithm also exhibits a powerful global search capability. In addition, the possible infeasible solutions generated during the re-sampling period of the EDA are eliminated by the HNN. Therefore, the merits of both these methods are combined in a unified framework. The proposed model is tested on a numerical example, the max-cut problem. The new and optimized model yielded a better performance than certain traditional intelligent optimization methods, such as HNN, genetic algorithm (GA). The proposed mutation Hopfield neural network (MHNN) is also used to solve a practical problem, aircraft landing scheduling (ALS).

The choice of the model plays a key role in the evolutionary process, indeed it strongly affects the convergence to the global optimum. From this point of view, in a black-box context, especially when the interactions among variables in the objective function are sparse, it becomes fundamental for an EDA to choose the right model, able to encode such correlations. In this paper we focus on EDAs based on undirected graphical models, such as Markov Networks. To learn the topology of the graph we apply a sparse method based on l(1)-regularized logistic regression, which has been demonstrated to be efficient in the high-dimensional case, i.e., when the number of observations is much smaller than the sample space. We propose a new algorithm within the DEUM framework, called DEUMl1, able to learn the interactions structure of the problem without the need of prior knowledge, and we compare its performance with other popular EDAs, over a set of well known benchmarks.",

This algorithm has been used to solve different kinds of scheduling problems successfully. However, due to its probabilistic model does not consider the variable interactions, ACGA may not perform well in some scheduling problems, particularly the sequence-dependent setup times are considered because a former job influences the processing time of next job. It is not sufficient that probabilistic model just captures the ordinal information from parental distribution. As a result, this paper proposes a bi-variate probabilistic model added into the ACGA. The new algorithm is named extended artificial chromosomes with genetic algorithm (eACGA) and it is used to solve single machine scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setup times in a common due-date environment. Some heuristics are also employed with eACGA. The results indicate that the average error ratio of eACGA is one-half of the ACGA. In addition, when eACGA works with other heuristics, the hybrid algorithm achieves the best solution quality when it is compared with other algorithms in literature. Thus, the proposed algorithms are effective for solving this scheduling problem with setup consideration.",

Different algorithms fit this framework, and they differ according to the policy they implement to identify the next distribution in the model. In this paper we present two algorithms, in the stochastic relaxation framework, for the optimization of real-valued functions defined over binary variables: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Stochastic Natural Gradient Descent (SNDG). These algorithms use a stochastic model to sample from as it happens for Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs), but the estimation of the model from the population is substituted by the direct update of model parameter through stochastic gradient descent. The two algorithms, SGD and SNDG, both use statistical models in the exponential family, but they differ in the use of the natural gradient, first proposed in the literature by Amari [5], in the context of Information Geometry. Due to the properties of the exponential family, both gradient and natural gradient can be evaluated in terms of covariances between the fitness function and the sufficient statistics of the exponential family. As the computation of the exact gradient is unfeasible, we approximate the gradient by evaluating empirical covariances. We test the performance of our algorithm over different standard benchmarks, and we compare the results with other well-known meta-heuristics in the framework of EDAs.",

        "description": "An evolutionary algorithm with guided mutation (EA/G) has been proposed recently for solving the maximum clique problem. In the framework of estimation-of-distribution algorithms, guided mutation uses a model distribution to generate offspring by combining the local information of solutions found so far with global statistical information. Each individual is then subjected to a Marchiori's repair heuristic, based on randomized extraction and greedy expansion, to ensure that it represents a legal clique. A novel reactive and evolutionary algorithm (R-EVO) proposed in this paper starts from the same evolutionary framework but considers more complex individuals, which modify tentative solutions by local search with memory, according to the reactive search optimization (RSO) principles. In particular, the estimated distribution is used to periodically initialize the state of each individual based on the previous statistical knowledge extracted from the population. We demonstrate that the combination of the estimation-of-distribution concept with RSO produces significantly better results than EA/G for many test instances and it is remarkably robust with respect to the setting of the algorithm parameters. R-EVO adopts a drastically simplified low-knowledge version of reactive local search (RLS), with a simple internal diversification mechanism based on tabu-search, with a prohibition parameter proportional to the estimated best clique size. R-EVO is competitive with the more complex full-knowledge RLS-EVO that adopts the original RLS algorithm. For most of the benchmark instances, the hybrid scheme version produces significantly better results than EA/G for comparable or a smaller central processing unit time.",

One of the main advantages of the EDAs over other optimization algorithms is that the former provides a trail of probabilistic models of candidate solutions with increasing quality. Some recent studies have applied these probabilistic models, obtained from previously solved problems in biasing the BOA algorithm, to solve the future problems. In this paper, in order to improve the previous works and reduce their disadvantages, a method based on Case Based Reasoning (CBR) is proposed for biasing the BOA algorithm. Herein, after running BOA for solving optimization problems, each problem, the corresponding solution, as well as the last Bayesian network obtained from the BOA algorithm, will be stored as an entry in the case-base. Upon introducing a new problem, similar problems from the case-base are retrieved and the last Bayesian networks of these solved problems are combined according to the degree of their similarity with the new problem; hence, a compound Bayesian network is constructed. The compound Bayesian network is sampled and the initial population for the BOA algorithm is generated. This network will be applied efficiently for biasing future probabilistic models during the runs of BOA for the new problem. The proposed method is tested on three well-known combinatorial benchmark problems. Experimental results show significant improvements in algorithm execution time and quality of solutions, compared to previous methods. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

However, it may be unnecessary for the EDAs to perturb all variables of candidate individuals at each generation. This is because one variable may be dependent on another variable and all variables may have different saliences even if they are independent. Therefore, only a subset of all variables in EDAs really function at each generation.|This paper proposes a novel class of EDAs, termed as subspace estimation of distribution algorithms (subEDAs), from a new perspective to reduce the space of variables for use in model building and model sampling based on EDAs' performance. In subEDAs, only part of all variables of candidate individuals are perturbed at each generation. Three schemes are described in details to determine which variables should be perturbed at each generation: the random picking method (RP), the majority voting based on the similarity between high quality individuals (MVSH) and the majority voting based on the difference between high quality and low quality individuals (MVDHL). Then, subEDAs + RP, subEDAs + MVSH and subEDAs + MVDHL are tested on several benchmark functions and their algorithmic results are compared with those obtained by EDAs. Our experimental results indicate that subEDAs are able to obtain a comparative result using only a subset of problem variables in the model when compared with traditional EDAs. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.

From a theoretical point of view, an EDA can be modeled as a sequence of densities in a statistical model that converges towards distributions with reduced support. Under this framework, at each iteration the empirical mean of the fitness function decreases in probability, until convergence of the population. This is the context of stochastic relaxation, i.e., the idea of looking for the minima of a function by minimizing its expected value over a set of probability densities. Our main interest is in the study of the gradient of the expected value of the function to be minimized, and in particular on how its landscape changes according to the fitness function and the statistical model used in the relaxation. After introducing some properties of the exponential family, such as the description of its topological closure and of its tangent space, we provide a characterization of the stationary points of the relaxed problem, together with a study of the minimizing sequences with reduced support. The analysis developed in the paper aims to provide a theoretical understanding of the behavior of EDAs, and in particular their ability to converge to the global minimum of the fitness function. The theoretical results of this paper, beside providing a formal framework for the analysis of EDAs, lead to the definition of a new class algorithms for binary functions optimization based on Stochastic Natural Gradient Descent (SNGD), where the estimation of the parameters of the distribution is replaced by the direct update of the model parameters by estimating the natural gradient of the expected value of the fitness function.",

In this scenario, heuristic mechanisms can be employed with the task of detecting errors rather than proving the system is correct. Recently, a metaheuristic EDA-based approach to detecting deadlock in multithreaded Java software has shown great promise in this area.

The results show that the ability of EDAs to solve problems could be lost immediately when the degree of variable interaction is larger than a threshold. We argue that this phase-transition phenomenon is closely related with the computational restrictions imposed in the learning step of this type of algorithms.

In this work, we present a novel class of evolutionary algorithms, estimation of distribution algorithms (EDA), as an efficient peak selector in this MS domain. There is a trade-of f between the reliability of the detected biomarkers and the low number of samples for analysis. For this reason, we introduce a consensus approach, built upon the classical EDA scheme, that improves stability and robustness of the final set of relevant peaks. An entire data workflow is designed to yield unbiased results. Four publicly available MS data sets (two MALDI-TOF and another two SELDI-TOF) are analyzed. The results are compared to the original works, and a new plot (peak frequential plot) for graphically inspecting the relevant peaks is introduced.

An empirical comparison on 3 decomposable functions, each with uniformly scaled building blocks of size 5 and 8, was carried out. The algorithm exhibits quadratic scaling with the problem dimensionality, but the comparison with the extended compact genetic algorithm and Bayesian optimization algorithm shows that it needs lower or comparable number of fitness function evaluations on the majority of functions for the tested problem dimensionalities.

From this standpoint, estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), which guide the search by using probabilistic models of the population, have brought a new view to evolutionary computation. While solving a given problem with an EDA, the user has access to a set of models that reveal probabilistic dependencies between variables, an important source of information about the problem. However, as the complexity of the used models increases, the chance of overfitting and consequently reducing model interpretability, increases as well. This paper investigates the relationship between the probabilistic models learned by the Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA) and the underlying problem structure. The purpose of the paper is threefold. First, model building in BOA is analyzed to understand how the problem structure is learned. Second, it is shown how the selection operator can lead to model overfitting in Bayesian EDAs. Third, the scoring metric that guides the search for an adequate model structure is modified to take into account the non-uniform distribution of the mating pool generated by tournament selection. Overall, this paper makes a contribution towards understanding and improving model accuracy in BOA, providing more interpretable models to assist efficiency enhancement techniques and human researchers.",

Performance is first tested against IB and SB competitors on synthetic datasets. Against IB competitors (GSMN algorithm and a version of the HHC algorithm adapted here for Markov networks discovery), IBMAP-HC showed reductions in edges Hamming distance with same order running times. Against SB competitors, both IBMAP-HC and our adaptation of HHC produced comparable Hamming distances, but with running times orders of magnitude faster. We also evaluated IBMAP-HC in a realistic, challenging testbed: EDAs, evolutionary algorithms for optimization that estimate a distribution on each generation.

The choice of the model plays a key role in the evolutionary process, indeed it strongly affects the convergence to the global optimum. From this point of view, in a black-box context, especially when the interactions among variables in the objective function are sparse, it becomes fundamental for an EDA to choose the right model, able to encode such correlations. In this paper we focus on EDAs based on undirected graphical models, such as Markov Networks. To learn the topology of the graph we apply a sparse method based on l(1)-regularized logistic regression, which has been demonstrated to be efficient in the high-dimensional case, i.e., when the number of observations is much smaller than the sample space.

This algorithm has been used to solve different kinds of scheduling problems successfully. However, due to its probabilistic model does not consider the variable interactions, ACGA may not perform well in some scheduling problems, particularly the sequence-dependent setup times are considered because a former job influences the processing time of next job. It is not sufficient that probabilistic model just captures the ordinal information from parental distribution. As a result, this paper proposes a bi-variate probabilistic model added into the ACGA. The new algorithm is named extended artificial chromosomes with genetic algorithm (eACGA) and it is used to solve single machine scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setup times in a common due-date environment. Some heuristics are also employed with eACGA. The results indicate that the average error ratio of eACGA is one-half of the ACGA. In addition, when eACGA works with other heuristics, the hybrid algorithm achieves the best solution quality when it is compared with other algorithms in literature.

In this paper we present two algorithms, in the stochastic relaxation framework, for the optimization of real-valued functions defined over binary variables: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Stochastic Natural Gradient Descent (SNDG). These algorithms use a stochastic model to sample from as it happens for Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs), but the estimation of the model from the population is substituted by the direct update of model parameter through stochastic gradient descent. The two algorithms, SGD and SNDG, both use statistical models in the exponential family, but they differ in the use of the natural gradient, first proposed in the literature by Amari [5], in the context of Information Geometry. Due to the properties of the exponential family, both gradient and natural gradient can be evaluated in terms of covariances between the fitness function and the sufficient statistics of the exponential family. As the computation of the exact gradient is unfeasible, we approximate the gradient by evaluating empirical covariances. We test the performance of our algorithm over different standard benchmarks, and we compare the results with other well-known meta-heuristics in the framework of EDAs.",

        "description": "An evolutionary algorithm with guided mutation (EA/G) has been proposed recently for solving the maximum clique problem. In the framework of estimation-of-distribution algorithms, guided mutation uses a model distribution to generate offspring by combining the local information of solutions found so far with global statistical information. Each individual is then subjected to a Marchiori's repair heuristic, based on randomized extraction and greedy expansion, to ensure that it represents a legal clique. A novel reactive and evolutionary algorithm (R-EVO) proposed in this paper starts from the same evolutionary framework but considers more complex individuals, which modify tentative solutions by local search with memory, according to the reactive search optimization (RSO) principles. In particular, the estimated distribution is used to periodically initialize the state of each individual based on the previous statistical knowledge extracted from the population. We demonstrate that the combination of the estimation-of-distribution concept with RSO produces significantly better results than EA/G for many test instances and it is remarkably robust with respect to the setting of the algorithm parameters. R-EVO adopts a drastically simplified low-knowledge version of reactive local search (RLS), with a simple internal diversification mechanism based on tabu-search, with a prohibition parameter proportional to the estimated best clique size. R-EVO is competitive with the more complex full-knowledge RLS-EVO that adopts the original RLS algorithm. For most of the benchmark instances, the hybrid scheme version produces significantly better results than EA/G for comparable or a smaller central processing unit time.",

        "description": "Studies show that application of the prior knowledge in biasing the Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs), such as Bayesian Optimization Algorithm (BOA), increases the efficiency of these algorithms significantly. One of the main advantages of the EDAs over other optimization algorithms is that the former provides a trail of probabilistic models of candidate solutions with increasing quality. Some recent studies have applied these probabilistic models, obtained from previously solved problems in biasing the BOA algorithm, to solve the future problems. In this paper, in order to improve the previous works and reduce their disadvantages, a method based on Case Based Reasoning (CBR) is proposed for biasing the BOA algorithm. Herein, after running BOA for solving optimization problems, each problem, the corresponding solution, as well as the last Bayesian network obtained from the BOA algorithm, will be stored as an entry in the case-base. Upon introducing a new problem, similar problems from the case-base are retrieved and the last Bayesian networks of these solved problems are combined according to the degree of their similarity with the new problem; hence, a compound Bayesian network is constructed. The compound Bayesian network is sampled and the initial population for the BOA algorithm is generated. This network will be applied efficiently for biasing future probabilistic models during the runs of BOA for the new problem. The proposed method is tested on three well-known combinatorial benchmark problems. Experimental results show significant improvements in algorithm execution time and quality of solutions, compared to previous methods. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
