        "description": "With the increasing concern on greenhouse gas emissions, green scheduling decision in the manufacturing factory is gaining more and more attention. This paper addresses the unrelated parallel machine green scheduling problem (UPMGSP) with criteria ofminimizing themakespan and the total carbon emission. To solve the problem, the estimation of distribution evolution memetic algorithm (EDEMA) is proposed. Firstly, based on the minimum machine load first principle, the initialization of the population is proposed. Second, a multi-objective non-dominated sorting approach and the crowding distance are adopted to improve the diversity of individual. Third, to estimate the probability distribution of the solution space, a probability model is presented to enhance the searching ability. Third, five neighbourhood searching operators are designed to handle the job-to-machine assignment. Moreover, the population catastrophe is used to maintain the sustainable diversity of the population. Finally, based on the randomly generated instances of the UPMGSP, extensive computational tests are carried out. The obtained computational results show that the EDEMA has the better searching capability and the better objective value than those of the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II and the estimation of distribution evolution algorithm (EDEA) in solving the UPMGSP.",

        "description": "The clonal selection algorithm (CSA), which describes the basic features of an immune response to an antigenic stimulus, has drawn a lot of attention in the biologically inspired computing community, due to its highly adaptive and easy-to-implement nature. Despite many successful applications, CSA still suffers from limited ability to explore the solution space. In this paper, we incorporate the differential evolution (DE) algorithm and the estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) into CSA, and thus propose a novel bio-inspired algorithm referred to as CSA-DE/EDA. In the proposed algorithm, the hypermutation and receptor editing processes are implemented based on DE and EDA, which provide improved local and global search ability, respectively. We have applied the proposed algorithm to five commonly used benchmark functions for optimization and brain magnetic resonance (MR) image segmentation. Our comparative experimental results show that the proposed CSA-DE/EDA algorithm outperforms several bio-inspired computing techniques. CSA-DE/EDA is a compelling bio-inspired algorithm for optimization tasks.",

        "description": "In recent years, hyper-heuristics have received massive attention from the research community as an alternative of meta-heuristics. In a hyper-heuristic, generation or selection of an effective heuristic among a pool of heuristics is an important and challenging task in the search process. At each iteration, a suitable heuristic can take the search process toward the global optimal solution. Moreover, some additional factors such as quality and the number of heuristics also affect the performance. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary algorithm based hyper-heuristic framework that incorporates dynamic selection of parameters. To test its generality, effectiveness and robustness, we apply this approach on two different NP-hard problems - set packing problem (SPP) and minimum weight dominating set (MWDS) problem. The proposed approach for the SPP and the MWDS problem has been evaluated respectively on their respective set of benchmark instances. Computational results show that the proposed approach for the SPP and MWDS problem perform much better than their respective state-of-the-art approaches in terms of the solution quality and computational time.

        "description": "We present new variants of Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDA) for large-scale continuous optimisation that extend and enhance a recently proposed random projection (RP) ensemble based approach. The main novelty here is to depart from the theory of RPs that require (sub-)Gaussian random matrices for norm-preservation, and instead for the purposes of high-dimensional search we propose to employ random matrices with independent and identically distributed entries drawn from a t-distribution. We analytically show that the implicitly resulting high-dimensional covariance of the search distribution is enlarged as a result. Moreover, the extent of this enlargement is controlled by a single parameter, the degree of freedom. For this reason, in the context of optimisation, such heavy tailed random matrices turn out to be preferable over the previously employed (sub-)Gaussians. Based on this observation, we then propose novel covariance adaptation schemes that are able to adapt the degree of freedom parameter during the search, and give rise to a flexible approach to balance exploration versus exploitation. We perform a thorough experimental study on high-dimensional benchmark functions, and provide statistical analyses that demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our approach when compared with existing alternatives in problems with 1 000 search variables.",

        "description": "The performance assessment of any control system plays a key role in industrial control systems. To meet the real-time requirements of modern control systems, a quick and accurate evaluation of the performance of a system is necessary. In this paper, a performance assessment method of a non-Gaussian control system based on mixture correntropy is proposed for non-Gaussian stochastic systems. Mixture correntropy can solve the problem of minimum entropy translation invariance. When the expected output of a system is unavailable, mixture correntropy combined with the estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) is used for system identification and noise distribution estimation so as to calculate the benchmark of entropy-based performance assessment. When the expected output of a system is available, the mixture correntropy is directly used as the index to evaluate the performance of the system. To improve the real-time aspect of the performance assessment, an improved EDA is presented to obtain the evaluation index more quickly. For both Gaussian and non-Gaussian systems, the mixture correntropy and the improved identification algorithm are used for system performance assessment, and the results are compared with the minimum entropy index and the probability density function (PDF) curve coincident area index. The comparisons verify the rationality and effectiveness of the correntropy index and the rapidity of the improved EDA algorithm.",

        "description": "A majority of existing works dealing with redundancy allocation problems are based on traditional series-parallel structures. While in many real-life scenarios, the way of connecting subsystems is not limited to a series-only configuration. This paper considers a generalized redundancy allocation problem (GRAP), where the system structure is a more general network. Since the reliability evaluation in GRAPs is a NP-hard problem and the traditional exact symbolic reliability calculation is not suitable, a cellular automata based monte carlo simulation method is implemented in this paper to estimate the system reliability. It is a relatively simple but effective method without knowing the MPs/MCs. Moreover, to deal with GRAPs, a novel discrete bat algorithm is proposed in this paper with a goal of determining an optimal system structure that achieves the minimum cost under several constraints by using redundant components in parallel. Computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is also calculated in this paper. In the end, three experiments are carried out based on ten networks to set parameters, measure the effectiveness of the modifications, and compare with other state-of-the-art algorithms, separately. The reported computational results show that the proposed algorithm is powerful, which is more superior on this sort of problems.",

        "description": "Software modularization techniques are employed to understand a software system. The purpose of modularization is to decompose a software system from a source code into meaningful and understandable subsystems (modules). Since modularization of a software system is an NP-hard problem, the modularization quality obtained using evolutionary algorithms is more reasonable than greedy algorithms. All evolutionary algorithms presented for software modularization only consider structural features that are dependent on the syntax of programming languages. For most programming languages, does not exist a tool to extract structural features, so it is not possible to modularize them. To overcome this problem, this paper presents a new multi-objective fitness function, named MOF, which exploits the structural (such as calling dependency and inheritance dependency) and non-structural features (such as semantic contained in the code comments and identifier names), aiming to automatically guide optimization algorithms to find a good decomposition of software systems. To evaluate the performance of this objective function, three optimization strategies, namely global-based search, combining global and local search, and Estimation of Distribution (EoD), are adapted to optimize it. The results on Mozilla Firefox indicate that the proposed algorithm which is based on EoD along with the new MOF function outperforms the algorithms that use structural-based objective functions in guiding the optimization process, in finding more understandable modules.",

The proposed method is used to demodulate the distortion spectrum of a FBG sensing network through an experiment. The results denote that EDA can not only maintain an average detection accuracy within 1 pm even when the spectrum of FBG is distorted but also quantitatively estimate the distortion degree of FBG. When compared with the traditional peak detection methods, the proposed method can effectively identify the Bragg wavelength from a distortion spectrum. The proposed method provides a novel method to extend the service life and enhance the reliability of an FBG sensor network.",

        "description": "Evolutionary algorithms play an important role for solving various optimization problems related to fuel management in reactor physics like core loading pattern optimization (LPO) or refueling. In general, all algorithms make a sample of solution candidates and evaluate the fitness of all candidates, and then the candidates with better fitness value are used to generate the next sample of solution candidates. In optimization algorithms, internal parameters [like population size, weighting factor in estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) and population size, cross-over rate, etc., in Genetic Algorithm (GA)] have a stiffness problem as the value of these parameters is fixed at the first generation and is not being changed subsequently. However, the flexibility of changing the value of even one internal parameter during the generations will make the algorithm more efficient. In this paper we propose that fuzzy logics can be used in an innovative way to eliminate the stiffness problem related to internal parameters in evolutionary algorithms. As a test case, EDA for initial core LPO of the advanced heavy water reactor is chosen, and the use of fuzzy logics has shown a significant improvement in the algorithm's performance. The appropriate value of weighting factor alpha in EDA has been predicted using fuzzy logics in each generation, and this has resulted in efficiency improvement of the algorithm. The improved methodology is expected to give better performance with other optimization algorithms, such as the GA or Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm, etc.",

        "description": "Considering the important issue of computer infections by worms spread via networks, the theme of source identification has been a prominent research field that aims at investigating infection propagation including acquiring knowledge about the infection and the node removal times when a worm infection happens. This information helps in identifying the patient zero in the worm attack and may be used by computer forensic investigators and network administrators to spot the culprits and to identify related network vulnerabilities. In this paper, we tackle this problem by developing new probabilistic models based on Bayesian networks. We learn a probability distribution to calculate, at every time step, the probability that each node is infected by a scanning worm, using historical data and features extracted from the network and application layers. With the mentioned probability distribution, the node infection status can be inferred using feature values at each time step. We propose a four-step method to investigate the time of infection and removal of each node probabilistically. First, features are extracted and derived from network traffic data. There are no suitable training and test datasets publicly available for our tests; therefore, we developed the training and test datasets using simulations of the Code Red II worm. Second, a prior model is built using training data. Third, the probabilistic model is built by the estimation of distribution algorithm. Fourth, the infection probability of nodes is inferred given the probability distribution and feature values at each time step. It has already been shown that the number of infectious nodes can be probabilistically approximated backward in time through the stochastic Back-to-Origin Markov model. We combine our first model with the prior stochastic Back-to-Origin Markov model to develop our second model. To evaluate our first and second models, we conducted experiments that show that these models can pinpoint the source node and the infection time of nodes with acceptable accuracy. It should be noted that our method could be employed with other propagating worm types including ransomware worms.",

Central to our understanding of nature-inspired search heuristics in this context is the notion of unbiasedness. Specialized black-box complexities have been developed in order to better understand the limitations of these heuristics - especially of (population-based) evolutionary algorithms (EAs). In contrast to this, we focus on a model for algorithms explicitly maintaining a probability distribution over the search space: so-called estimation-of-distribution algorithms (EDAs). We consider the recently introduced n-Bernoulli-lambda-EDA framework, which subsumes, for example, the commonly known EDAs PBIL, UMDA, lambda-MMAS(IB), and cGA. We show that an n-Bernoulli-lambda-EDA is unbiased if and only if its probability distribution satisfies a certain invariance property under isometric automorphisms of [0, 1](n). By restricting how an n-Bernoulli-lambda-EDA can perform an update, in a way common to many examples, we derive conciser characterizations, which are easy to verify. We demonstrate this by showing that our examples above are all unbiased. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

With the rapid growth of web services with similar functionalities, Quality of Service (QoS) has emerged as an important quantitative criterion on non-functional aspects. The optimization of QoS-aware service composition, depending on different aggregated QoS attributes has attracted significant attention. The dynamic nature of QoS-aware service composition adds further challenges to the optimization problem. Most existing approaches ignore the diversity of solutions, which have the potential to provide alternative compositions when changes occur. A few works only partially explore the search space and do not consider the optimality of solutions and the computational cost concurrently. To address these issues, we propose a novel reactive approach, called MrEDA, which integrates the estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA), restricted boltzmann machine (RBM), and multi-agent technology. It constructs a refined probabilistic model to diversify alternative solutions and guide the search by adaptively capturing the promising information of a service composition. Meanwhile, multiple agents make use of a flexible parallelism with distinct explorations and adaptive sampling to improve the global optimization and speed up the optimization. The effectiveness and efficiency of our approach for adaptive service composition is validated through an extensive experimental evaluation. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

Simultaneous resource management and mode selection in emerging cellular networks having D2D capabilities can surely improve overall system throughput. This work addresses the problem of overall throughput maximization of emerging cellular networks while ensuring the power and interference constraints. The joint resource management problem is NP-Hard and is classified as mixed integer non-linear constraint optimization problem. Due to the fact that, the computational complexity of the system increases exponentially with the increase in users, it is almost impossible to find sub-optimal solution in polynomial time using greedy approach. Therefore, this paper applies evolutionary technique, like estimation of distribution algorithm which has the potential to address the complex problems having combinatorial nature such as joint resource management strategy in D2D. Near optimal solution convergence is achieved by the algorithm with minimal number of iterations. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach as compared to other algorithms.",

Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) are a major branch of meta-heuristic algorithms. However, how to effectively build the probabilistic model for EDA in high dimensions is confronted with obstacle, making them less attractive due to the large computational requirements. To overcome the shortcomings of EDAs, this paper proposed a latent space-based EDA (LS-EDA), which transforms the multivariate probabilistic model of Gaussian-based EDA into its principal component latent subspace with lower dimensionality. LS-EDA can efficiently reduce the complexity of EDA while maintaining its probability model without losing key information to scale up its performance for LSGOs. When the original dimensions are projected to the latent subspace, those dimensions with larger projected value make more contribution to the optimization process. LS-EDA can also help recognize and understand the problem structure, especially for black-box optimization problems. Due to dimensionality reduction, its computational budget and population size can be effectively reduced while its performance is highly competitive in comparison with the state-of-the-art meta-heuristic algorithms for LSGOs. In order to understand the strengths and weaknesses of LS-EDA, we have carried out extensive computational studies.

        "description": "Protein structure prediction is one of the major challenges in structural biology and has wide potential applications in biotechnology. However, the problem is faced with a difficult optimization requirement with particularly complex energy landscapes. The current article aims to present a novel approach namely AHEDA as an evolutionary-based solution to overcome the problem. AHEDA uses the hydrophobic-polar model to develop a robust and efficient evolutionary-based algorithm for protein structure prediction. The method utilizes an integrated estimation of distribution algorithm that attempts to optimize the search process and prevent the destruction of structural blocks. It also uses a stochastic local search to improve its accuracy. Based on a comprehensive comparison with other existing methods on 24 widely used benchmarks, AHEDA was shown to generate highly accurate predictions compared to the other similar methods.",

        "description": "As a type of model-based metaheuristic, estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) show certain advantages over other metaheuristics by using statistical learning method to estimate the distribution of promising solutions. However, the commonly-used Gaussian EDAs (GEDAs) usually suffer from premature convergence that severely limits their efficiency. In this paper, we first attempt to enhance the performance of GEDA by improving its model estimation method. The new estimation method shifts the weighted mean of high-quality solutions towards the fitness improvement direction and estimates the covariance matrix by taking the shifted mean as the center. Theoretical analyses show that the new covariance matrix is essentially a rank-one modification (R1M) of the original one. It could effectively adjust both the search scope and the search direction of GEDA, and thus improving the search efficiency. Furthermore, considering the importance of the population size tuning in GEDA, we develop a population reduction (PR) strategy which linearly reduces the population size throughout the evolution. By this means, the exploration and exploitation ability of GEDA could be balanced better in different search stages and a more proper utilization of limited computation resource can be achieved. Combining GEDA with the R1M and PR strategies, a novel EDA variant named EDA-R1M-PR is developed. The performance of EDA-R1M-PR was comprehensively evaluated and compared with that of several state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms. Experimental results indicate that the R1M and PR strategies effectively enhance the global optimization ability of GEDA and the resultant EDA-R1M-PR significantly outperforms its competitors on a set of benchmark functions.",

The goal is to cut a subset of rectangles without overlap from a rectangular strip of width W and height H, so that the total profit of the rectangles from the subset is maximal. The sides of the rectangles are parallel to the strip sides and every cutting is restricted by orthogonal guillotine-cuts. A guillotine-cut is parallel to the horizontal or vertical side of the strip and cuts the strip into two separated rectangular strips.

Production scheduling is an effective approach for energy-savings management. During the entire workshop production process, both the processing and transportation operations consume large amounts of energy. To reduce energy consumption, an energy-efficient job-shop scheduling problem (EJSP) with transportation constraints was proposed in this paper. First, a mixed-integer programming model was established to minimize both the comprehensive energy consumption and makespan in the EJSP. Then, an enhanced estimation of distribution algorithm (EEDA) was developed to solve the problem. In the proposed algorithm, an estimation of distribution algorithm was employed to perform the global search and an improved simulated annealing algorithm was designed to perform the local search.

        "description": "In this paper, an elitist nondominated sorting hybrid algorithm, namely ENSHA, is proposed to solve the multi-objective flexible job-shop scheduling problem (MOFJSSP) with sequence-dependent setup times/costs (MOFJSSP_SDST/C). The objectives to be minimized are the maximal completion time (i.e., makespan) and the total setup costs (TSC). The makespan is an efficiency-focused objective whereas the TSC is an economic focused one. Existing works mainly consider the efficiency-focused multiple criteria. The main highlights of this paper are threefold, i.e., the operation-based sequence model, the problem-dependent job assignment rules and the novel evolutionary framework of ENSHA. For the operation-based sequence model, this is the first time that the sequence model of MOFJSSPs has been proposed and the TSC has been treated as an independent objective in MOFJSSPs. For the job assignment rules, the solution representation is first proposed, and then three job assignment rules are specifically designed to decode solutions or sequences into feasible scheduling schemes. For the novel evolutionary framework, it works with two populations, i.e., the main population (MP) and the auxiliary population (AP). First, ENSHA adopts the elitist nondominated sorting method for evolving MP to maintain high-quality solutions regarding both the convergence and diversity. Next, a machine learning strategy based on the estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) is proposed to learn the valuable information from nondominated solutions in MP for building a probabilistic model. This model is then used to generate the offspring of AP. Furthermore, a simple yet effective cooperation-based refinement mechanism is raised to combine MP and AP, so as to generate MP of the next generation. Finally, experimental results on 39 benchmark instances and a real-life case study demonstrate the effectiveness and application values of the proposed ENSHA. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

To optimize this model, we propose a local incremental estimation of distribution algorithm with an asymmetrical domination relationship within the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition framework. The conflict between the selection mechanism and the domination relationship is also analyzed theoretically for the first time. To obtain robust solutions under this conflict, the local distribution information of a certain subproblem within several generations is encompassed into a local incremental distribution model. As a generalized form of the existing domination relationship, an asymmetrical domination relationship (ADR), which treats the current and past objective values differently, is proposed to select robust solutions. The proposed algorithm is also tested on four designed problems compared with another four popular algorithms and proves its superiority. Some important parameters are also investigated in the experiments and some guidelines on tuning these parameters are given as well. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "description": "In order to address the wavelength demodulation of the overlapped spectra for the fiber Bragg grating sensor networks with limited source bandwidth, a wavelength demodulation method based on peak match estimation of distribution algorithm is proposed. The proposed method transforms the wavelength demodulation problem into a function optimization problem, where the optimization model is constructed through minimizing the difference between the theoretical spectra and the overlapped spectra. The peak match estimation of distribution algorithm is applied to solve the optimization model and obtain the sensing data for each fiber Bragg grating. Estimation of distribution algorithmutilizes the Gaussian mixture model to build probability distribution of the solution space for fiber Bragg grating sensor network, and the probability model can generate new individuals in the evolution of estimation of distribution algorithm. The peak match operator is introduced into the estimation of distribution algorithm to avoid the mismatch of the peak values of fiber Bragg gratings and obtain the final optimal solution. The experiments are conducted under different numbers of fiber Bragg grating sensor network using the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method yields the mean errors within 10 pm for the large scale fiber Bragg grating sensor network even when the spectra of fiber Bragg gratings are completely overlapped. Compared with other demodulation methods, accuracy of the proposed method is hi g her, and it can well solve the wavelength demodulation problem when the spectra of fiber Bragg gratings within the network are partially or completely overlapped.

Constraints including vehicle powertrain boundaries, road gradients, and speed limits, are taken into consideration. In the first stage, the HEV operating conditions, including the optimal vehicle SOC, speed profiles, and total driving time, are generated for the entire trip before departure. Based on the pre-trip results, the second stage adapts the vehicle speed for a short horizon when driving, while taking the safety spacing to the preceding vehicle into consideration, which acts as an indicator of actual traffic conditions and guarantees safe driving. Both optimisations are conducted under the distance domain for realising localisation in the optimal speed profile due to frequent changes in traffic conditions. An estimation of distribution algorithm is used to run the simulation so that the feasibility, robustness, and effectiveness of the proposed hierarchical control can be demonstrated.",

Thus, InfoVis scenarios were used to analyze the evolutionary process of a tool named AutoClustering, which generates density-based clustering algorithms automatically for a given dataset using the EDA (estimation-of-distribution algorithm) evolutionary technique. Some scenarios were about fitness and population evolution (clustering algorithms) over time, algorithm parameters, the occurrence of the individual, and others.

To optimize the productivity, production lines are optimized to have short transportation paths and short processing times at the stations that process intermediate components or the final product. A factory's layout is a key factor in this optimization aspect. This optimization mostly comprises the machine tools' positions with respect to places where supply goods are being delivered and other tools are stationed, often neglecting the paths that workers need to take at the shop floor. This impairs a factory's productivity, as machines may need to wait for workers, who operated another machine and are still on the way due to the long distance between the machines. In this work, we present BlueCollar, a visual analytics approach that supports layout planners to explore and optimize existing factory layouts regarding the paths taken by workers. Planners can visually inspect the paths that workers need to take based on their work schedule and the factory's layout. An estimation of distribution algorithm supports them in choosing which layout elements, e.g., shared tool caches, to relocate. Its intermediate and final results are used to provide visual cues for suitable relocation areas, and to suggest new layouts automatically. We demonstrate our approach through an application scenario based on a realistic prototype layout provided by an external company.",

However, RM-MEDA and IM-MOEA are still challenged when solving MOPs with many local Pareto fronts, and usually generate poor solutions when the population has no obvious regularity. In order to overcome these limits, an ensemble of RM-MEDA and IM-MOEA, denoted as RM-IM-EDA, is proposed in this paper. This ensemble is based on a dynamic mixture of the sampling in the decision space by the regularity-based learning model and the sampling in the objective space using the inverse learning models. In addition, a sequence-based deterministic initialization method is introduced to identify the properties of fitness landscape. The objective behind this scheme is to reduce the probability of sinking into the local Pareto optimum. For the comparison purposes, the proposed RM-IM-EDA is tested on 32 benchmark problems.

This paper proposes an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) based approach, termed as learning fixed-height histogram (LFHH) to solve path planning problems for AUVs in dynamic environment. The LFHH uses a learning transformation strategy (LTS) to improve its accuracy and convergence speed. Besides, a smooth method is employed to accelerate the speed of finding feasible paths. Moreover, a planning window is adopted to help handle dynamic factors.

One class of these probability models is distance-based exponential models, and one example of this class is the Mallows model. In spite of the practical success, the theoretical analysis of Estimation of Distribution Algorithms for permutation-based combinatorial optimization problems has not been extensively developed. With this motivation, this paper presents a first mathematical analysis of the convergence behavior of Estimation of Distribution Algorithms based on the Mallows model by using an infinite population to associate a dynamical system to the algorithm. Several scenarios, with different fitness functions and initial probability distributions of increasing complexity, are analyzed obtaining unexpected results in some cases.",

The project is divided into 20 equal periods and first three periods are used for simulating the next point. The predicted data for each point is achieved by using of previous points from the beginning. The model is based on artificial neural network, and it is trained by three algorithms which are Genetic Algorithm (GA), Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA), and hybrid GA-EDA method. Two dynamic ratios are used which are dividing the population into two halves, and the other is a ratio without dividing. The ratio would give a proportion to GA and EDA models in the hybrid algorithm, and then the hybrid algorithm could model the system more accurately. For each algorithm, three main errors are calculated which are mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean square error (MSE), and root means square error (RMSE). The best result is achieved for hybrid GA-EDA model without dividing the population and the MAPE, RMSE, and MSE values are %0.022, 28944.59 Dollars, and 837789503.79 Dollars, respectively.

The capacity of deep neural network relies on the parameter training algorithm which is always based on the gradient information. However, for deep neural network, it is harder and harder for training due to depth of the neural network and a large number of parameters. Therefore, kinds of techniques are proposed to cope with this problem. However, the training algorithm is almost based on the gradient information with inherent defect. Evolutionary algorithm has the advantage of global optimization capability, independent of gradient information etc. Estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) is a typical evolutionary algorithm which relies on the probability model of population. Therefore, the EDA is adopted to train the weight and bias of deep neural network in his paper. However, the large scale optimization capability of EDA is limited. Thereby, an improved strategy is proposed to enhance the large scale optimization capability of EDA. In the improved scheme, a random selection strategy is carried out to select partial variables for probability modeling instead of all of the variables, in order to reduce the computing time and the probability of combination explosion. A simulation is carried out to exhibit the validity of the improved algorithm.",

        "description": "Service-oriented computing is a computing paradigm that creates reusable modules over the Internet, often known as Web services. Web service composition aims to accomplish more complex functions by loosely coupling web services. Researchers have been proposing evolutionary computation (EC) techniques for efficiently building up composite services with optimized non-functional quality (i.e., QoS). Some of these techniques employ multi-objective EC algorithms to handle conflict qualities in QoS for fully automated service composition. One recent state-of-art work hybridizes NSGA-II and MOEA/D, which allows the multi-objective service composition problem to be decomposed into many scalar optimization subproblems, where a simple form of local search can be easily applied. However, their local search is considered to be less effective and efficient because it is randomly applied to a predefined large number of subproblems without focusing on the most suitable candidate solutions. In this paper, we propose a memetic NSGA-II with probabilistic model-based local search based on Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA). In particular, a clustering technique is employed to select suitable Pareto solutions for local search. Each selected solution and its belonged cluster members are used to learn a distribution model that samples new solutions for local improvements. Besides that, a more challenging service composition problem that optimizes both functional and non-functional quality is considered. Experiments have shown that our method can effectively and efficiently produce better Pareto optimal solutions compared to other state-of-art methods in the literature.",

        "description": "The main feature of the Dynamic Multi-objective Optimization Problems (DMOPs) is that optimization objective functions will change with times or environments. One of the promising approaches for solving the DMOPs is reusing the obtained Pareto optimal set (POS) to train prediction models via machine learning approaches. In this paper, we train an Incremental Support Vector Machine (ISVM) classifier with the past POS, and then the solutions of the DMOP we want to solve at the next moment are filtered through the trained ISVM classifier. A high-quality initial population will be generated by the ISVM classifier, and a variety of different types of population-based dynamic multi-objective optimization algorithms can benefit from the population. To verify this idea, we incorporate the proposed approach into three evolutionary algorithms, the multi-objective particle swarm optimization(MOPSO), Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), and the Regularity Model-based multi-objective estimation of distribution algorithm(RE-MEDA). We employ experimentS to test these algorithms, and experimental results show the effectiveness.",

Compared with traditional cloud computing system, fog computing is one of the promising solutions of processing the huge amount of local data and decreasing the end-to-end latency. Hard and soft deadlines are assigned to the tasks of applications to model the users' needs. In this work, the resource allocation and task scheduling problem under fog system is considered to minimize total tardiness of the tasks and meet the hard deadlines. A deadline-aware estimation of distributed algorithm (dEDA) with a repair procedure and local search is adopted to determine the task processing order and computing node allocation. The comparative results show that the solution produced by our proposed algorithm performs better than the algorithm without repair procedure or knowledge driven local search.

BMDA is a type of Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) that exploits the dependency knowledge learned between design variables without requiring too many fitness evaluations, which tend to be expensive for the current application. BMDA is extended with adaptive chi-square testing to identify dependencies and Gibbs sampling to generate new solutions. Also, repair operations based on CP are used to deal with infeasible solutions found during search. The method is applied to a vehicle suspension design problem and is found to be more effective in converging to good solutions than a genetic algorithm and other EDAs.

When the algorithm stagnates, two random walk strategies, namely, Gaussian random walk and Levy walk, are activated to enrich the population diversity. Moreover, RW-GEDA is executed in an Eigen coordinate framework to promote the evolution towards the dominant region. The performance of RW-GEDA is evaluated by using the CEC 2014 test suite and compared with other top algorithms from different communities as well as promising GEDA extensions. The statistical results demonstrate the competitive performance of our proposed RW-GEDA in terms of efficiency and accuracy.

Hybrid recommendation by articulating the content-based and collaborative filtering techniques is popular and effective for the personalized recommendation, but has not been developed to improve the performance of IEA for fulfilling the personalized search. Accordingly, we here propose an enhanced interactive estimation of distribution algorithm by designing dual-probabilistic models based on the hybrid recommendation for personalized search. The concept of hybrid personalized search is first defined from the viewpoint of using not only the historical search information but also the social or group preference. A dual-probabilistic model by sufficiently combining the content-based and collaborative filtering is presented and used to design the effective interactive estimation of distribution algorithm (IEDA). The probabilistic model is directly combined with the initialization of IEDA for illuminating the sparsity of the traditional IEA in encoding. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in fast and efficient searching with a lower computational cost is experimentally illustrated by two typical personalized searches on movies and TV series described with documents.",

Based on this regularity property, the ratio of the sum of the first (m - 1) largest eigenvalue of the population's covariance matrix to the sum of the whole eigenvalue can be employed to illustrate the degree of convergence of the population. This paper proposes a new algorithm, named DE/RM-MEDA, which hybridizes differential evolution (DE) and estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) for multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs) with the complicated PS. In the proposed algorithm, EDA extracts the population distribution information to sample new trial solutions by establishing a probability model, while DE uses the individual information to create others new individuals through the mutation and crossover operators. At each generation, the number of new solutions generated by the two operators is adjusted by the above-defined ratio. The proposed algorithm is validated on nine tec09 problems. The sensitivity and the scalability have also been experimentally investigated in this paper. The comparison results between DE/RM-MEDA and the other two state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms, namely NSGA-II-DE and RM-MEDA, show that the proposed algorithm is highly competitive algorithms for solving MOPs with complicated PSs in terms of convergence and diversity metrics.",

        "description": "Camera calibration and radial distortion correction are the crucial prerequisites for many applications in image big data and computer vision. Many existing works rely on the Manhattan world assumption to estimate the camera parameters automatically; however, they may perform poorly when there was lack of man-made structure in the scene. As walking humans are the common objects in video surveillance, they have also been used for camera self-calibration, but the main challenges include the noise reduction for the estimation of vanishing points, the relaxation of assumptions on unknown camera parameters, and the radial distortion correction. In this paper, we present a novel framework for camera self-calibration and automatic radial distortion correction. Our approach starts with the reliable human body segmentation that is facilitated by robust object tracking. Mean shift clustering and Laplace linear regression are, respectively, introduced in the estimation of the vertical vanishing point and the horizon line. The estimation of distribution algorithm, an evolutionary optimization scheme, is then utilized to optimize the camera parameters and the distortion coefficients, in which all the unknowns in camera projection can be fine-tuned simultaneously. Experiments on the three public benchmarks and our own captured dataset demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method. The superiority of this algorithm is also verified by the capability of reliably converting 2D object tracking into 3D space.",

        "description": "The importance of calibration of microscopic traffic models as the main core of traffic simulation software results from the need for more realistic traffic behaviors. The latent essence of several parameters in such models as well as the uncertainties resulting from the noise in the data, make the process of calibration much more complex. Usually, the calibration process is formulated as an optimization problem. Selecting the appropriate solution algorithm due to nonlinear and non convex nature of the problem is crucial. The importance of the issue is more significant when the matter of calibrating the medium or large-scale simulation model is considered. This is mainly due to the expensive cost that running the simulation models impose. Therefore, applying the current algorithms in which finding the appropriate solutions requires a large number of simulation runs is not deemed suitable. In this paper, an estimation of distribution algorithm based on copula theory has been suggested. In contrast with traditional solution algorithms, in the proposed algorithm complex interaction between parameters of a model has been considered by constructing and sampling from a copula-based probabilistic model. Copulas are functions that describe the dependence structure of a set of random variables and connect multivariate distribution functions to one-dimensional marginal distribution functions. The results indicate that applying an explicit probabilistic model based on copula helps the estimation of distribution algorithm to explore the search space more effectively and efficiently as well as provides the possibility of extracting the knowledge with regard to the structure of the calibration problem through analyzing the probabilistic models that are constructed during the evolution process. Furthermore, this new algorithm has been compared with the genetic algorithm and kernel-based cross-entropy method on synthetic and real trajectory data. The results confirm that the proposed algorithm is more efficient in terms of convergence rate, resource usage and more robust in terms of the probability of finding the global optimal solution.",

In this paper, a new approach, based on decomposition and the MOEA/D framework, is proposed: model and clustering based estimation of distribution algorithm (MCEDA). MOEA/D means the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition. The proposed MCEDA is a new estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) framework, which is intended to extend the application of estimation of distribution algorithm to MaOPs. MCEDA was implemented by two similar algorithm, MCEDA/B (based on bits model) and MCEDA/RM (based on regular model) to deal with MaOPs. In MCEDA, the problem is decomposed into several subproblems. For each subproblem, clustering algorithm is applied to divide the population into several subgroups. On each subgroup, an estimation model is created to generate the new population. In this work, two kinds of models are adopted, the new proposed bits model and the regular model used in RM-MEDA (a regularity model based multi-objective estimation of distribution algorithm).

In order to demonstrate the performance of MOEDAFS, a comparative study is designed by internal and external comparison on NSL-KDD dataset. Internal comparison is performed between the four versions of MOEDAFS.

        "description": "Fitness approximation methods have been widely employed in evolutionary algorithms to reduce the number of fitness evaluations in solving expensive optimization problems. As a simple and efficient approximation approach, k-nearest neighbors (kNN) estimates the fitness value of an unknown solution by combining the fitness values of its nearest neighbors according to a similarity measure. kNN generally adopts the Euclidean distance as the similarity measure, which may limit its performance as the solution distribution information is underutilized in the approximation process. Aiming at this issue, this study proposes a Mahalanobis distance-based k-nearest neighbors (MkNN) to improve the approximation accuracy by utilizing the distribution information. Compared to the Euclidean distance-based kNN (EkNN), MkNN adopts the Mahalanobis distance to measure the similarity between solutions, which is capable of capturing the distribution information of solutions and thus can improve the approximation efficiency. Furthermore, considering that the main idea of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) is also to learn the distribution information of solutions, the proposed MkNN as well as EkNN are combined with an EDA and two new algorithms named EDA-MkNN and EDA-EkNN, respectively, are developed for expensive optimization. The performances of EDA-MkNN and EDA-EkNN were comprehensively tested on a set of 28 benchmark functions and compared with that of a typical EDA. Experimental results demonstrate that MkNN and EkNN could effectively improve the performance of EDA in solving different kinds of expensive optimization problems and MkNN can have an edge over EkNN on condition that the distribution information is well captured.",

The first method, Variational Autoencoder with Population Queue (VAE-EDA-Q), employs a queue of historical populations, which is updated at each iteration of EDA in order to smooth the data generation process. The second method uses Adaptive Variance Scaling (AVS) with VAE-EDA-Q to dynamically update the variance at which the probabilistic model is sampled. The results obtained prove our methods to be significantly more computationally efficient than state-of-the-art algorithms and perform significantly less number of fitness evaluations when tested on benchmark problems such as Trap-k and NK Landscapes. Moreover, we report results of applying our approach successfully to highly complex problems such as Trap 11, Trap 13, and NK Landscapes with neighborhood size K = 8 and K = 10.",

        "description": "Several metaheuristics have been developed for global optimization. Most of them are designed for solving a specific problem at hand, and their use on a new implementation is a challenging task. Hyper-heuristics are strategies that support these issues, combining a metaheuristic in a high-level for selecting or generating simple heuristics from a low-level. The aim is to find nearoptimal solutions based on the feedback received during the search. Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) have been applied as hyper-heuristics, using a Probabilistic Graphical Model (PGM) to extract and represent interactions between its low-level heuristics to provide high-valued problem solutions. In this paper, we consider an EDA based on Bayesian networks as PGM on a hyper-heuristic context which encompasses a heuristic selection approach to find the best combinations of different known simple heuristics. We compare our proposed approach named Hyper-heuristic approach based on Bayesian Optimization Algorithm (HHBOA) using CEC'05 benchmark functions among 9 optimization algorithms. The experimental results show that HHBOA is competitive, outperforming the other approaches, especially in terms of convergence, on most of the functions considered in this paper.",

The Boltzmann Probability Distribution Function (Boltzmann-PDF) provides advantages when used in energy based EDAs. However, direct sampling from the Boltzmann-PDF to update the probabilistic model is unpractical, and several EDAs employ an approximation to the Boltzmann-PDF by means of a Gaussian distribution that is usually derived by the minimization of the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL-divergence) computed between the Gaussian and the Boltzmann-PDFs. The KL-divergence measure is not symmetric, and this causes the Gaussian approximation to fail at correctly modeling the target function for the EDAs, because the parameters of the Gaussian are not optimally estimated. In this paper, we derive an approximation to the Boltzmann-PDF using Jeffreys' divergence (a symmetric measure) in lieu of the KL-divergence and thus improve the performance of the optimization algorithm. Our approach is termed Symmetric-approximation Energy-based Estimation of Distribution (SEED) algorithm. The SEED algorithm is experimentally compared under a univariate approach against two other EDAs (UMDAc and BUMDA) on several benchmark optimization problems. The results show that the SEED algorithm is more effective and more efficient than the other algorithms.",

Even for the Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm (UMDA)-a simple population-based EDA assuming independence between decision variables-the optimisation time on the linear problem OneMaxwas until recently undetermined. The incomplete theoretical understanding of EDAs is mainly due to the lack of appropriate analytical tools. We show that the recently developed level-based theorem for non-elitist populations combined with anti-concentration results yield upper bounds on the expected optimisation time of the UMDA. This approach results in the bound O(n lambda log lambda + n(2))on the LeadingOnes and BinVal problems for population sizes lambda > mu = Omega(log n), where mu and lambda are parameters of the algorithm. We also prove that the UMDA with population sizes mu is an element of O (root n) boolean AND Omega (log n) optimises OneMax in expected time O(lambda n), and for larger population sizes mu = Omega(root n log n), in expected time O (lambda root n) The facility and generality of our arguments suggest that this is a promising approach to derive bounds on the expected optimisation time of EDAs.",

We present a running time analysis of the UMDA on the classical OneMax benchmark function for wide ranges of the parameters mu and lambda. If mu >= c log n for some constant c > 0 and lambda = (1+ Theta(1)) mu, we obtain a general bound O (mu n) on the expected running time. This bound crucially assumes that all marginal probabilities of the algorithm are confined to the interval [1/n, 1 - 1/n]. If mu >= c' root n log n for a constant c' > 0 and lambda = (1 + Theta(1)) mu, the behavior of the algorithm changes and the bound on the expected running time becomes O(mu root n), which typically holds even if the borders on the marginal probabilities are omitted. The results supplement the recently derived lower bound Omega (mu root n + n log n) by Krejca and Witt (Proceedings of FOGA 2017, ACM Press, New York, pp 65-79, 2017) and turn out to be tight for the two very different choices mu = c log n and mu = c' root n log n.

For this, reinforcement learning is a naturally fitting paradigm. A proof-of-principle framework, called SL-ENDA, based on estimation of normal distribution algorithms in combination with reinforcement learning is defined. SL-ENDA uses an RL-agent to decide upon the next population mean while approaching the rest of the algorithm as the environment. A comparison of SL-ENDA to AMaLGaM and CMA-ES on unimodal noiseless functions shows mostly comparable performance and scalability to the broadly used and carefully manually crafted algorithms.

Vessel detection is performed by Gaussian matched filters (GMF) trained by the univariate marginal distribution algorithm for a continuous domain. The detection results are evaluated in terms of the area (A(z)) under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The second step is focused on the binary classification of the response obtained from the GMF method. In the final step, the vessel skeleton simplification is carried out by using the Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm. During the computational experiments, the proposed framework obtained a detection performance of A(z) = 0.926. The interclass variance method was selected from five state-of-the-art thresholding methods according to its classification accuracy on the segmentation of the detection response (0.923). In the final step, a graph-based structure of the coronary arteries with a data compression ratio of 0.954 is obtained. Based on the experimental results, the proposed method has demonstrated that it is suitable for a variety of applications in computer-aided diagnosis.",

In this paper, we show that traditional reproduction operators such as p-uniform and n-point crossover may sabotage the functioning of diversity preservation mechanisms by producing more solutions in some areas of the objective-space than in others, i.e., they are biased. We argue that such reproductive bias is due to their high degree of disruptiveness which favors the generation of average quality offspring. Additionally, we demonstrated the impact of linkage learning in decreasing disruptiveness and reproductive bias. Such a result helps to understand the benefits of estimation of distribution algorithms in bi-objective optimization. We performed experiments on instances of the rho MNK-model, in which the use of unbiased reproduction operators was shown to work in synergy with diversity preservation mechanisms favoring the diversity of the Pareto-fronts obtained.",

Neuron states of the hopfield neural network converge to minimum energy, but the solution produced is confined to the limited number of solution spaces. The MHNN is incorporated with the global search capability of the estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), which typically explore various solution spaces. The main purpose is to estimate other possible neuron states that lead to global minimum energy through available output measurements. Furthermore, it is shown that the MHNN can retrieve various neuron states with the lowest minimum energy. Subsequent simulations performed on the MHNN reveal that the approach yields a result that surpasses the conventional hybrid HNN.

As all EDAs, compact algorithms build and update a probabilistic model of the distribution of solutions within the search space, as opposed to population-based algorithms that instead make use of an explicit population of solutions. In addition to that, to keep their memory consumption low, compact algorithms purposely employ simple probabilistic models that can be described with a small number of parameters. Despite their simplicity, compact algorithms have shown good performances on a broad range of benchmark functions and real-world problems. However, compact algorithms also come with some drawbacks, i.e. they tend to premature convergence and show poorer performance on non-separable problems. To overcome these limitations, here we investigate a possible algorithmic scheme obtained by combining compact algorithms with a non-disruptive restart mechanism taken from the literature, named Re-Sampled Inheritance (RI). The resulting compact algorithms with RI are tested on the CEC 2014 benchmark functions. The numerical results show on the one hand that the use of RI consistently enhances the performances of compact algorithms, still keeping a limited usage of memory. On the other hand, our experiments show that among the tested algorithms, the best performance is obtained by compact Differential Evolution with RI.",

It refers to finding the optimal subset of a spectral library to reconstruct the image data and further estimate the proportions of different materials. Recently, multi-objective based sparse unmixing methods have presented promising performance because of their advantages in addressing combinatorial problems. A spectral and multi-objective based sparse unmixing (SMoSU) algorithm was proposed in our previous work, which solves the decision-making problem well. However, it does not show outstanding advantages in strong noise cases. To solve the problem, in this paper, SMoSU is improved based on the estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). The machine learning based EDAs have been a reliable approach in solving multi-objective problems. However, most of them are for special problems and relatively weak in theoretical foundations. Thus, it is unreliable to extend it directly to sparse unmixing. Here, we improve EDA on the basis of classification and propose a classification-based model for individual generating under the framework of SMoSU (CM-MoSU). In CM-MoSU, the whole population is divided to be positive and negative. Then, the macroinformation of positive individuals is used to guide the generation of new individuals. Therefore, the optimization task could pay more attention to the feasible space with high quality. Moreover, some theoretical analyses are presented to prove the reliability of CM-MoSU. In experiments, several state-of-the-art sparse unmixing algorithms are compared. Both synthetic and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CM-MoSU.",

        "description": "Animal communication impacts many kinds of behavior including mating and courtship, escaping from predators and foraging activity. In this article, our investigation focuses primarily on how alarm communication impacts foraging activity, using individual based computer simulations. We used this approach to help resolve a debate in the literature between the risk-allocation hypothesis, which predicts that over time, animals become habituated to alarm communication versus the hypothesis that alarm communication consistently decreases foraging activity to avoid predators. We found that in most cases, alarm communication did indeed decrease foraging activity whereas in other cases, alarm communication resulted in habituation and a gradual increase in foraging activity, suggesting that there is some truth to both hypotheses. Moreover, it is possible that a decrease in foraging as well as habituation in response to alarm communication both contribute to fitness, or more generally, that alarm communication contributes to fitness as opposed to non-communication. Among the communication runs, we found that although there were higher levels of fitness compared with non-communication runs, fitness was higher when communication results in decreased foraging activity vs. runs where communication results in increased foraging activity. Finally, we used a variational autoencoder based estimation of distribution algorithms in conjuction with C4.5 decision trees as a wrapper to discern the features that distinguish communication runs from non-communication runs. In general, communication runs tend to have relatively low population densities, whereas non-communication runs tend to have relatively high population densities, suggesting that the ability to communicate fear obviates the need for prey to stay in close proximity to one another in order to defend against predators. Also a high level of reproductive urgency was observed in individuals with communication ability when the level of fear of predators was low.",

EDA is used to explore the search space and MI is integrated as a probabilistic model to guide the search by modeling the redundancy and relevance relations between features. Therefore, we propose four probabilistic models for MOEDAFS. MOEDAFS selects the better feature subsets (non-dominated solutions) that have a better detection accuracy and smaller number of features. MOEDAFS uses two objective functions (minimizing classification Error Rate (ER) and minimizing the Number of Features(NF)). In order to demonstrate the performance of MOEDAFS, a comparative study is designed by internal and external comparison on NSL-KDD dataset. Internal comparison is performed between the four versions of MOEDAFS.

        "authors": "Liang, YS, Ren, ZG, Pang, B",
        "description": "Fitness approximation methods have been widely employed in evolutionary algorithms to reduce the number of fitness evaluations in solving expensive optimization problems. As a simple and efficient approximation approach, k-nearest neighbors (kNN) estimates the fitness value of an unknown solution by combining the fitness values of its nearest neighbors according to a similarity measure. kNN generally adopts the Euclidean distance as the similarity measure, which may limit its performance as the solution distribution information is underutilized in the approximation process. Aiming at this issue, this study proposes a Mahalanobis distance-based k-nearest neighbors (MkNN) to improve the approximation accuracy by utilizing the distribution information. Compared to the Euclidean distance-based kNN (EkNN), MkNN adopts the Mahalanobis distance to measure the similarity between solutions, which is capable of capturing the distribution information of solutions and thus can improve the approximation efficiency. Furthermore, considering that the main idea of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) is also to learn the distribution information of solutions, the proposed MkNN as well as EkNN are combined with an EDA and two new algorithms named EDA-MkNN and EDA-EkNN, respectively, are developed for expensive optimization. The performances of EDA-MkNN and EDA-EkNN were comprehensively tested on a set of 28 benchmark functions and compared with that of a typical EDA. Experimental results demonstrate that MkNN and EkNN could effectively improve the performance of EDA in solving different kinds of expensive optimization problems and MkNN can have an edge over EkNN on condition that the distribution information is well captured.",

The first method, Variational Autoencoder with Population Queue (VAE-EDA-Q), employs a queue of historical populations, which is updated at each iteration of EDA in order to smooth the data generation process. The second method uses Adaptive Variance Scaling (AVS) with VAE-EDA-Q to dynamically update the variance at which the probabilistic model is sampled. The results obtained prove our methods to be significantly more computationally efficient than state-of-the-art algorithms and perform significantly less number of fitness evaluations when tested on benchmark problems such as Trap-k and NK Landscapes. Moreover, we report results of applying our approach successfully to highly complex problems such as Trap 11, Trap 13, and NK Landscapes with neighborhood size K = 8 and K = 10.",

        "description": "Several metaheuristics have been developed for global optimization. Most of them are designed for solving a specific problem at hand, and their use on a new implementation is a challenging task. Hyper-heuristics are strategies that support these issues, combining a metaheuristic in a high-level for selecting or generating simple heuristics from a low-level. The aim is to find nearoptimal solutions based on the feedback received during the search. Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) have been applied as hyper-heuristics, using a Probabilistic Graphical Model (PGM) to extract and represent interactions between its low-level heuristics to provide high-valued problem solutions. In this paper, we consider an EDA based on Bayesian networks as PGM on a hyper-heuristic context which encompasses a heuristic selection approach to find the best combinations of different known simple heuristics. We compare our proposed approach named Hyper-heuristic approach based on Bayesian Optimization Algorithm (HHBOA) using CEC'05 benchmark functions among 9 optimization algorithms. The experimental results show that HHBOA is competitive, outperforming the other approaches, especially in terms of convergence, on most of the functions considered in this paper.",

The Boltzmann Probability Distribution Function (Boltzmann-PDF) provides advantages when used in energy based EDAs. However, direct sampling from the Boltzmann-PDF to update the probabilistic model is unpractical, and several EDAs employ an approximation to the Boltzmann-PDF by means of a Gaussian distribution that is usually derived by the minimization of the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL-divergence) computed between the Gaussian and the Boltzmann-PDFs. The KL-divergence measure is not symmetric, and this causes the Gaussian approximation to fail at correctly modeling the target function for the EDAs, because the parameters of the Gaussian are not optimally estimated. In this paper, we derive an approximation to the Boltzmann-PDF using Jeffreys' divergence (a symmetric measure) in lieu of the KL-divergence and thus improve the performance of the optimization algorithm. Our approach is termed Symmetric-approximation Energy-based Estimation of Distribution (SEED) algorithm. The SEED algorithm is experimentally compared under a univariate approach against two other EDAs (UMDAc and BUMDA) on several benchmark optimization problems.

Even for the Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm (UMDA)-a simple population-based EDA assuming independence between decision variables-the optimisation time on the linear problem OneMaxwas until recently undetermined. The incomplete theoretical understanding of EDAs is mainly due to the lack of appropriate analytical tools. We show that the recently developed level-based theorem for non-elitist populations combined with anti-concentration results yield upper bounds on the expected optimisation time of the UMDA. This approach results in the bound O(n lambda log lambda + n(2))on the LeadingOnes and BinVal problems for population sizes lambda > mu = Omega(log n), where mu and lambda are parameters of the algorithm. We also prove that the UMDA with population sizes mu is an element of O (root n) boolean AND Omega (log n) optimises OneMax in expected time O(lambda n), and for larger population sizes mu = Omega(root n log n), in expected time O (lambda root n) The facility and generality of our arguments suggest that this is a promising approach to derive bounds on the expected optimisation time of EDAs.",

We present a running time analysis of the UMDA on the classical OneMax benchmark function for wide ranges of the parameters mu and lambda. If mu >= c log n for some constant c > 0 and lambda = (1+ Theta(1)) mu, we obtain a general bound O (mu n) on the expected running time. This bound crucially assumes that all marginal probabilities of the algorithm are confined to the interval [1/n, 1 - 1/n]. If mu >= c' root n log n for a constant c' > 0 and lambda = (1 + Theta(1)) mu, the behavior of the algorithm changes and the bound on the expected running time becomes O(mu root n), which typically holds even if the borders on the marginal probabilities are omitted. The results supplement the recently derived lower bound Omega (mu root n + n log n) by Krejca and Witt (Proceedings of FOGA 2017, ACM Press, New York, pp 65-79, 2017) and turn out to be tight for the two very different choices mu = c log n and mu = c' root n log n.

In this paper, we introduce the concept of a new type of MBEA that can automatically specialize its behavior to a given problem class using tabula rasa self-learning. For this, reinforcement learning is a naturally fitting paradigm. A proof-of-principle framework, called SL-ENDA, based on estimation of normal distribution algorithms in combination with reinforcement learning is defined. SL-ENDA uses an RL-agent to decide upon the next population mean while approaching the rest of the algorithm as the environment. A comparison of SL-ENDA to AMaLGaM and CMA-ES on unimodal noiseless functions shows mostly comparable performance and scalability to the broadly used and carefully manually crafted algorithms.

The detection results are evaluated in terms of the area (A(z)) under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The second step is focused on the binary classification of the response obtained from the GMF method. In the final step, the vessel skeleton simplification is carried out by using the Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm. During the computational experiments, the proposed framework obtained a detection performance of A(z) = 0.926. The interclass variance method was selected from five state-of-the-art thresholding methods according to its classification accuracy on the segmentation of the detection response (0.923). In the final step, a graph-based structure of the coronary arteries with a data compression ratio of 0.954 is obtained. Based on the experimental results, the proposed method has demonstrated that it is suitable for a variety of applications in computer-aided diagnosis.",

In this paper, we show that traditional reproduction operators such as p-uniform and n-point crossover may sabotage the functioning of diversity preservation mechanisms by producing more solutions in some areas of the objective-space than in others, i.e., they are biased. We argue that such reproductive bias is due to their high degree of disruptiveness which favors the generation of average quality offspring. Additionally, we demonstrated the impact of linkage learning in decreasing disruptiveness and reproductive bias. Such a result helps to understand the benefits of estimation of distribution algorithms in bi-objective optimization. We performed experiments on instances of the rho MNK-model, in which the use of unbiased reproduction operators was shown to work in synergy with diversity preservation mechanisms favoring the diversity of the Pareto-fronts obtained.",

Neuron states of the hopfield neural network converge to minimum energy, but the solution produced is confined to the limited number of solution spaces. The MHNN is incorporated with the global search capability of the estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), which typically explore various solution spaces. The main purpose is to estimate other possible neuron states that lead to global minimum energy through available output measurements. Furthermore, it is shown that the MHNN can retrieve various neuron states with the lowest minimum energy. Subsequent simulations performed on the MHNN reveal that the approach yields a result that surpasses the conventional hybrid HNN.

As all EDAs, compact algorithms build and update a probabilistic model of the distribution of solutions within the search space, as opposed to population-based algorithms that instead make use of an explicit population of solutions. In addition to that, to keep their memory consumption low, compact algorithms purposely employ simple probabilistic models that can be described with a small number of parameters. Despite their simplicity, compact algorithms have shown good performances on a broad range of benchmark functions and real-world problems. However, compact algorithms also come with some drawbacks, i.e. they tend to premature convergence and show poorer performance on non-separable problems. To overcome these limitations, here we investigate a possible algorithmic scheme obtained by combining compact algorithms with a non-disruptive restart mechanism taken from the literature, named Re-Sampled Inheritance (RI). The resulting compact algorithms with RI are tested on the CEC 2014 benchmark functions. The numerical results show on the one hand that the use of RI consistently enhances the performances of compact algorithms, still keeping a limited usage of memory. On the other hand, our experiments show that among the tested algorithms, the best performance is obtained by compact Differential Evolution with RI.",

It refers to finding the optimal subset of a spectral library to reconstruct the image data and further estimate the proportions of different materials. Recently, multi-objective based sparse unmixing methods have presented promising performance because of their advantages in addressing combinatorial problems. A spectral and multi-objective based sparse unmixing (SMoSU) algorithm was proposed in our previous work, which solves the decision-making problem well. However, it does not show outstanding advantages in strong noise cases. To solve the problem, in this paper, SMoSU is improved based on the estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). The machine learning based EDAs have been a reliable approach in solving multi-objective problems. However, most of them are for special problems and relatively weak in theoretical foundations. Thus, it is unreliable to extend it directly to sparse unmixing. Here, we improve EDA on the basis of classification and propose a classification-based model for individual generating under the framework of SMoSU (CM-MoSU). In CM-MoSU, the whole population is divided to be positive and negative. Then, the macroinformation of positive individuals is used to guide the generation of new individuals. Therefore, the optimization task could pay more attention to the feasible space with high quality. Moreover, some theoretical analyses are presented to prove the reliability of CM-MoSU. In experiments, several state-of-the-art sparse unmixing algorithms are compared. Both synthetic and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CM-MoSU.",

        "description": "Animal communication impacts many kinds of behavior including mating and courtship, escaping from predators and foraging activity. In this article, our investigation focuses primarily on how alarm communication impacts foraging activity, using individual based computer simulations. We used this approach to help resolve a debate in the literature between the risk-allocation hypothesis, which predicts that over time, animals become habituated to alarm communication versus the hypothesis that alarm communication consistently decreases foraging activity to avoid predators. We found that in most cases, alarm communication did indeed decrease foraging activity whereas in other cases, alarm communication resulted in habituation and a gradual increase in foraging activity, suggesting that there is some truth to both hypotheses. Moreover, it is possible that a decrease in foraging as well as habituation in response to alarm communication both contribute to fitness, or more generally, that alarm communication contributes to fitness as opposed to non-communication. Among the communication runs, we found that although there were higher levels of fitness compared with non-communication runs, fitness was higher when communication results in decreased foraging activity vs. runs where communication results in increased foraging activity. Finally, we used a variational autoencoder based estimation of distribution algorithms in conjuction with C4.5 decision trees as a wrapper to discern the features that distinguish communication runs from non-communication runs. In general, communication runs tend to have relatively low population densities, whereas non-communication runs tend to have relatively high population densities, suggesting that the ability to communicate fear obviates the need for prey to stay in close proximity to one another in order to defend against predators. Also a high level of reproductive urgency was observed in individuals with communication ability when the level of fear of predators was low.",

EDA is used to explore the search space and MI is integrated as a probabilistic model to guide the search by modeling the redundancy and relevance relations between features. Therefore, we propose four probabilistic models for MOEDAFS. MOEDAFS selects the better feature subsets (non-dominated solutions) that have a better detection accuracy and smaller number of features. MOEDAFS uses two objective functions (minimizing classification Error Rate (ER) and minimizing the Number of Features(NF)). In order to demonstrate the performance of MOEDAFS, a comparative study is designed by internal and external comparison on NSL-KDD dataset. Internal comparison is performed between the four versions of MOEDAFS.

As a simple and efficient approximation approach, k-nearest neighbors (kNN) estimates the fitness value of an unknown solution by combining the fitness values of its nearest neighbors according to a similarity measure. kNN generally adopts the Euclidean distance as the similarity measure, which may limit its performance as the solution distribution information is underutilized in the approximation process. Aiming at this issue, this study proposes a Mahalanobis distance-based k-nearest neighbors (MkNN) to improve the approximation accuracy by utilizing the distribution information. Compared to the Euclidean distance-based kNN (EkNN), MkNN adopts the Mahalanobis distance to measure the similarity between solutions, which is capable of capturing the distribution information of solutions and thus can improve the approximation efficiency. Furthermore, considering that the main idea of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) is also to learn the distribution information of solutions, the proposed MkNN as well as EkNN are combined with an EDA and two new algorithms named EDA-MkNN and EDA-EkNN, respectively, are developed for expensive optimization. The performances of EDA-MkNN and EDA-EkNN were comprehensively tested on a set of 28 benchmark functions and compared with that of a typical EDA. Experimental results demonstrate that MkNN and EkNN could effectively improve the performance of EDA in solving different kinds of expensive optimization problems and MkNN can have an edge over EkNN on condition that the distribution information is well captured.",

The second method uses Adaptive Variance Scaling (AVS) with VAE-EDA-Q to dynamically update the variance at which the probabilistic model is sampled. The results obtained prove our methods to be significantly more computationally efficient than state-of-the-art algorithms and perform significantly less number of fitness evaluations when tested on benchmark problems such as Trap-k and NK Landscapes.

Most of them are designed for solving a specific problem at hand, and their use on a new implementation is a challenging task. Hyper-heuristics are strategies that support these issues, combining a metaheuristic in a high-level for selecting or generating simple heuristics from a low-level. The aim is to find nearoptimal solutions based on the feedback received during the search. Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) have been applied as hyper-heuristics, using a Probabilistic Graphical Model (PGM) to extract and represent interactions between its low-level heuristics to provide high-valued problem solutions. In this paper, we consider an EDA based on Bayesian networks as PGM on a hyper-heuristic context which encompasses a heuristic selection approach to find the best combinations of different known simple heuristics. We compare our proposed approach named Hyper-heuristic approach based on Bayesian Optimization Algorithm (HHBOA) using CEC'05 benchmark functions among 9 optimization algorithms.

The Boltzmann Probability Distribution Function (Boltzmann-PDF) provides advantages when used in energy based EDAs. However, direct sampling from the Boltzmann-PDF to update the probabilistic model is unpractical, and several EDAs employ an approximation to the Boltzmann-PDF by means of a Gaussian distribution that is usually derived by the minimization of the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL-divergence) computed between the Gaussian and the Boltzmann-PDFs. The KL-divergence measure is not symmetric, and this causes the Gaussian approximation to fail at correctly modeling the target function for the EDAs, because the parameters of the Gaussian are not optimally estimated. In this paper, we derive an approximation to the Boltzmann-PDF using Jeffreys' divergence (a symmetric measure) in lieu of the KL-divergence and thus improve the performance of the optimization algorithm. Our approach is termed Symmetric-approximation Energy-based Estimation of Distribution (SEED) algorithm. The SEED algorithm is experimentally compared under a univariate approach against two other EDAs (UMDAc and BUMDA) on several benchmark optimization problems.

Even for the Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm (UMDA)-a simple population-based EDA assuming independence between decision variables-the optimisation time on the linear problem OneMaxwas until recently undetermined. The incomplete theoretical understanding of EDAs is mainly due to the lack of appropriate analytical tools. We show that the recently developed level-based theorem for non-elitist populations combined with anti-concentration results yield upper bounds on the expected optimisation time of the UMDA. This approach results in the bound O(n lambda log lambda + n(2))on the LeadingOnes and BinVal problems for population sizes lambda > mu = Omega(log n), where mu and lambda are parameters of the algorithm. We also prove that the UMDA with population sizes mu is an element of O (root n) boolean AND Omega (log n) optimises OneMax in expected time O(lambda n), and for larger population sizes mu = Omega(root n log n), in expected time O (lambda root n) The facility and generality of our arguments suggest that this is a promising approach to derive bounds on the expected optimisation time of EDAs.",

We present a running time analysis of the UMDA on the classical OneMax benchmark function for wide ranges of the parameters mu and lambda. If mu >= c log n for some constant c > 0 and lambda = (1+ Theta(1)) mu, we obtain a general bound O (mu n) on the expected running time. This bound crucially assumes that all marginal probabilities of the algorithm are confined to the interval [1/n, 1 - 1/n]. If mu >= c' root n log n for a constant c' > 0 and lambda = (1 + Theta(1)) mu, the behavior of the algorithm changes and the bound on the expected running time becomes O(mu root n), which typically holds even if the borders on the marginal probabilities are omitted. The results supplement the recently derived lower bound Omega (mu root n + n log n) by Krejca and Witt (Proceedings of FOGA 2017, ACM Press, New York, pp 65-79, 2017) and turn out to be tight for the two very different choices mu = c log n and mu = c' root n log n.

In this paper, we introduce the concept of a new type of MBEA that can automatically specialize its behavior to a given problem class using tabula rasa self-learning. For this, reinforcement learning is a naturally fitting paradigm. A proof-of-principle framework, called SL-ENDA, based on estimation of normal distribution algorithms in combination with reinforcement learning is defined. SL-ENDA uses an RL-agent to decide upon the next population mean while approaching the rest of the algorithm as the environment. A comparison of SL-ENDA to AMaLGaM and CMA-ES on unimodal noiseless functions shows mostly comparable performance and scalability to the broadly used and carefully manually crafted algorithms. This result, in combination with the inherent potential of self-learning model-based evolutionary algorithms with regard to specialization, opens the door to a new research direction with great potential impact on the field of model-based evolutionary algorithms.",

The detection results are evaluated in terms of the area (A(z)) under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The second step is focused on the binary classification of the response obtained from the GMF method. In the final step, the vessel skeleton simplification is carried out by using the Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm. During the computational experiments, the proposed framework obtained a detection performance of A(z) = 0.926. The interclass variance method was selected from five state-of-the-art thresholding methods according to its classification accuracy on the segmentation of the detection response (0.923). In the final step, a graph-based structure of the coronary arteries with a data compression ratio of 0.954 is obtained. Based on the experimental results, the proposed method has demonstrated that it is suitable for a variety of applications in computer-aided diagnosis.",

In this paper, we show that traditional reproduction operators such as p-uniform and n-point crossover may sabotage the functioning of diversity preservation mechanisms by producing more solutions in some areas of the objective-space than in others, i.e., they are biased. We argue that such reproductive bias is due to their high degree of disruptiveness which favors the generation of average quality offspring. Additionally, we demonstrated the impact of linkage learning in decreasing disruptiveness and reproductive bias. Such a result helps to understand the benefits of estimation of distribution algorithms in bi-objective optimization. We performed experiments on instances of the rho MNK-model, in which the use of unbiased reproduction operators was shown to work in synergy with diversity preservation mechanisms favoring the diversity of the Pareto-fronts obtained.",

Neuron states of the hopfield neural network converge to minimum energy, but the solution produced is confined to the limited number of solution spaces. The MHNN is incorporated with the global search capability of the estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), which typically explore various solution spaces. The main purpose is to estimate other possible neuron states that lead to global minimum energy through available output measurements. Furthermore, it is shown that the MHNN can retrieve various neuron states with the lowest minimum energy.

As all EDAs, compact algorithms build and update a probabilistic model of the distribution of solutions within the search space, as opposed to population-based algorithms that instead make use of an explicit population of solutions. In addition to that, to keep their memory consumption low, compact algorithms purposely employ simple probabilistic models that can be described with a small number of parameters. Despite their simplicity, compact algorithms have shown good performances on a broad range of benchmark functions and real-world problems. However, compact algorithms also come with some drawbacks, i.e. they tend to premature convergence and show poorer performance on non-separable problems. To overcome these limitations, here we investigate a possible algorithmic scheme obtained by combining compact algorithms with a non-disruptive restart mechanism taken from the literature, named Re-Sampled Inheritance (RI). The resulting compact algorithms with RI are tested on the CEC 2014 benchmark functions. The numerical results show on the one hand that the use of RI consistently enhances the performances of compact algorithms, still keeping a limited usage of memory. On the other hand, our experiments show that among the tested algorithms, the best performance is obtained by compact Differential Evolution with RI.",

It refers to finding the optimal subset of a spectral library to reconstruct the image data and further estimate the proportions of different materials. Recently, multi-objective based sparse unmixing methods have presented promising performance because of their advantages in addressing combinatorial problems. A spectral and multi-objective based sparse unmixing (SMoSU) algorithm was proposed in our previous work, which solves the decision-making problem well. However, it does not show outstanding advantages in strong noise cases. To solve the problem, in this paper, SMoSU is improved based on the estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). The machine learning based EDAs have been a reliable approach in solving multi-objective problems. However, most of them are for special problems and relatively weak in theoretical foundations. Thus, it is unreliable to extend it directly to sparse unmixing. Here, we improve EDA on the basis of classification and propose a classification-based model for individual generating under the framework of SMoSU (CM-MoSU). In CM-MoSU, the whole population is divided to be positive and negative. Then, the macroinformation of positive individuals is used to guide the generation of new individuals. Therefore, the optimization task could pay more attention to the feasible space with high quality. Moreover, some theoretical analyses are presented to prove the reliability of CM-MoSU. In experiments, several state-of-the-art sparse unmixing algorithms are compared. Both synthetic and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CM-MoSU.",

        "description": "Animal communication impacts many kinds of behavior including mating and courtship, escaping from predators and foraging activity. In this article, our investigation focuses primarily on how alarm communication impacts foraging activity, using individual based computer simulations. We used this approach to help resolve a debate in the literature between the risk-allocation hypothesis, which predicts that over time, animals become habituated to alarm communication versus the hypothesis that alarm communication consistently decreases foraging activity to avoid predators. We found that in most cases, alarm communication did indeed decrease foraging activity whereas in other cases, alarm communication resulted in habituation and a gradual increase in foraging activity, suggesting that there is some truth to both hypotheses. Moreover, it is possible that a decrease in foraging as well as habituation in response to alarm communication both contribute to fitness, or more generally, that alarm communication contributes to fitness as opposed to non-communication. Among the communication runs, we found that although there were higher levels of fitness compared with non-communication runs, fitness was higher when communication results in decreased foraging activity vs. runs where communication results in increased foraging activity. Finally, we used a variational autoencoder based estimation of distribution algorithms in conjuction with C4.5 decision trees as a wrapper to discern the features that distinguish communication runs from non-communication runs. In general, communication runs tend to have relatively low population densities, whereas non-communication runs tend to have relatively high population densities, suggesting that the ability to communicate fear obviates the need for prey to stay in close proximity to one another in order to defend against predators. Also a high level of reproductive urgency was observed in individuals with communication ability when the level of fear of predators was low.",

Therefore, we propose four probabilistic models for MOEDAFS. MOEDAFS selects the better feature subsets (non-dominated solutions) that have a better detection accuracy and smaller number of features. MOEDAFS uses two objective functions (minimizing classification Error Rate (ER) and minimizing the Number of Features(NF)). In order to demonstrate the performance of MOEDAFS, a comparative study is designed by internal and external comparison on NSL-KDD dataset. Internal comparison is performed between the four versions of MOEDAFS.

        "title": "A Mahalanobis Distance-based Fitness Approximation Method for Estimation of Distribution Algorithms in Solving Expensive Optimization Problems",
        "authors": "Liang, YS, Ren, ZG, Pang, B",
        "description": "Fitness approximation methods have been widely employed in evolutionary algorithms to reduce the number of fitness evaluations in solving expensive optimization problems. As a simple and efficient approximation approach, k-nearest neighbors (kNN) estimates the fitness value of an unknown solution by combining the fitness values of its nearest neighbors according to a similarity measure. kNN generally adopts the Euclidean distance as the similarity measure, which may limit its performance as the solution distribution information is underutilized in the approximation process. Aiming at this issue, this study proposes a Mahalanobis distance-based k-nearest neighbors (MkNN) to improve the approximation accuracy by utilizing the distribution information. Compared to the Euclidean distance-based kNN (EkNN), MkNN adopts the Mahalanobis distance to measure the similarity between solutions, which is capable of capturing the distribution information of solutions and thus can improve the approximation efficiency. Furthermore, considering that the main idea of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) is also to learn the distribution information of solutions, the proposed MkNN as well as EkNN are combined with an EDA and two new algorithms named EDA-MkNN and EDA-EkNN, respectively, are developed for expensive optimization. The performances of EDA-MkNN and EDA-EkNN were comprehensively tested on a set of 28 benchmark functions and compared with that of a typical EDA. Experimental results demonstrate that MkNN and EkNN could effectively improve the performance of EDA in solving different kinds of expensive optimization problems and MkNN can have an edge over EkNN on condition that the distribution information is well captured.",

The second method uses Adaptive Variance Scaling (AVS) with VAE-EDA-Q to dynamically update the variance at which the probabilistic model is sampled. The results obtained prove our methods to be significantly more computationally efficient than state-of-the-art algorithms and perform significantly less number of fitness evaluations when tested on benchmark problems such as Trap-k and NK Landscapes.

        "description": "Several metaheuristics have been developed for global optimization. Most of them are designed for solving a specific problem at hand, and their use on a new implementation is a challenging task. Hyper-heuristics are strategies that support these issues, combining a metaheuristic in a high-level for selecting or generating simple heuristics from a low-level. The aim is to find nearoptimal solutions based on the feedback received during the search. Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) have been applied as hyper-heuristics, using a Probabilistic Graphical Model (PGM) to extract and represent interactions between its low-level heuristics to provide high-valued problem solutions. In this paper, we consider an EDA based on Bayesian networks as PGM on a hyper-heuristic context which encompasses a heuristic selection approach to find the best combinations of different known simple heuristics. We compare our proposed approach named Hyper-heuristic approach based on Bayesian Optimization Algorithm (HHBOA) using CEC'05 benchmark functions among 9 optimization algorithms. The experimental results show that HHBOA is competitive, outperforming the other approaches, especially in terms of convergence, on most of the functions considered in this paper.",

        "description": "Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) maintain and iteratively update a probabilistic model to tackle optimization problems. The Boltzmann Probability Distribution Function (Boltzmann-PDF) provides advantages when used in energy based EDAs. However, direct sampling from the Boltzmann-PDF to update the probabilistic model is unpractical, and several EDAs employ an approximation to the Boltzmann-PDF by means of a Gaussian distribution that is usually derived by the minimization of the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL-divergence) computed between the Gaussian and the Boltzmann-PDFs. The KL-divergence measure is not symmetric, and this causes the Gaussian approximation to fail at correctly modeling the target function for the EDAs, because the parameters of the Gaussian are not optimally estimated. In this paper, we derive an approximation to the Boltzmann-PDF using Jeffreys' divergence (a symmetric measure) in lieu of the KL-divergence and thus improve the performance of the optimization algorithm. Our approach is termed Symmetric-approximation Energy-based Estimation of Distribution (SEED) algorithm. The SEED algorithm is experimentally compared under a univariate approach against two other EDAs (UMDAc and BUMDA) on several benchmark optimization problems. The results show that the SEED algorithm is more effective and more efficient than the other algorithms.",

Despite their popularity in real-world applications, there is little rigorous understanding of their performance. Even for the Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm (UMDA)-a simple population-based EDA assuming independence between decision variables-the optimisation time on the linear problem OneMaxwas until recently undetermined. The incomplete theoretical understanding of EDAs is mainly due to the lack of appropriate analytical tools. We show that the recently developed level-based theorem for non-elitist populations combined with anti-concentration results yield upper bounds on the expected optimisation time of the UMDA. This approach results in the bound O(n lambda log lambda + n(2))on the LeadingOnes and BinVal problems for population sizes lambda > mu = Omega(log n), where mu and lambda are parameters of the algorithm. We also prove that the UMDA with population sizes mu is an element of O (root n) boolean AND Omega (log n) optimises OneMax in expected time O(lambda n), and for larger population sizes mu = Omega(root n log n), in expected time O (lambda root n) The facility and generality of our arguments suggest that this is a promising approach to derive bounds on the expected optimisation time of EDAs.",

This problem is a typical NP-hard problem. The hyper-heuristic algorithm comprises of two level frameworks. In the high-level, an evolutionary algorithm is employed to explore the search space.

In GAs, the location information of the solutions found so far is directly used to generate offspring. On the other hand, EDAs use global statistical information to generate new offspring. In EDAs the global statistical information is stored in the form probability vector, and a new offspring is generated by sampling this probability vector.

        "description": "The Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm (UMDA) is a randomized search heuristic that builds a stochastic model of the underlying optimization problem by repeatedly sampling. solutions and adjusting the model according to the best mu samples. We present a running time analysis of the UMDA on the classical OneMax benchmark function for wide ranges of the parameters mu and lambda. If mu >= c log n for some constant c > 0 and lambda = (1+ Theta(1)) mu, we obtain a general bound O (mu n) on the expected running time. This bound crucially assumes that all marginal probabilities of the algorithm are confined to the interval [1/n, 1 - 1/n]. If mu >= c' root n log n for a constant c' > 0 and lambda = (1 + Theta(1)) mu, the behavior of the algorithm changes and the bound on the expected running time becomes O(mu root n), which typically holds even if the borders on the marginal probabilities are omitted. The results supplement the recently derived lower bound Omega (mu root n + n log n) by Krejca and Witt (Proceedings of FOGA 2017, ACM Press, New York, pp 65-79, 2017) and turn out to be tight for the two very different choices mu = c log n and mu = c' root n log n.

In this paper, we introduce the concept of a new type of MBEA that can automatically specialize its behavior to a given problem class using tabula rasa self-learning. For this, reinforcement learning is a naturally fitting paradigm. A proof-of-principle framework, called SL-ENDA, based on estimation of normal distribution algorithms in combination with reinforcement learning is defined. SL-ENDA uses an RL-agent to decide upon the next population mean while approaching the rest of the algorithm as the environment. A comparison of SL-ENDA to AMaLGaM and CMA-ES on unimodal noiseless functions shows mostly comparable performance and scalability to the broadly used and carefully manually crafted algorithms. This result, in combination with the inherent potential of self-learning model-based evolutionary algorithms with regard to specialization, opens the door to a new research direction with great potential impact on the field of model-based evolutionary algorithms.",

The detection results are evaluated in terms of the area (A(z)) under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The second step is focused on the binary classification of the response obtained from the GMF method. In the final step, the vessel skeleton simplification is carried out by using the Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm. During the computational experiments, the proposed framework obtained a detection performance of A(z) = 0.926. The interclass variance method was selected from five state-of-the-art thresholding methods according to its classification accuracy on the segmentation of the detection response (0.923). In the final step, a graph-based structure of the coronary arteries with a data compression ratio of 0.954 is obtained. Based on the experimental results, the proposed method has demonstrated that it is suitable for a variety of applications in computer-aided diagnosis.",

In this paper, we show that traditional reproduction operators such as p-uniform and n-point crossover may sabotage the functioning of diversity preservation mechanisms by producing more solutions in some areas of the objective-space than in others, i.e., they are biased. We argue that such reproductive bias is due to their high degree of disruptiveness which favors the generation of average quality offspring. Additionally, we demonstrated the impact of linkage learning in decreasing disruptiveness and reproductive bias. Such a result helps to understand the benefits of estimation of distribution algorithms in bi-objective optimization. We performed experiments on instances of the rho MNK-model, in which the use of unbiased reproduction operators was shown to work in synergy with diversity preservation mechanisms favoring the diversity of the Pareto-fronts obtained.",

Neuron states of the hopfield neural network converge to minimum energy, but the solution produced is confined to the limited number of solution spaces. The MHNN is incorporated with the global search capability of the estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), which typically explore various solution spaces. The main purpose is to estimate other possible neuron states that lead to global minimum energy through available output measurements. Furthermore, it is shown that the MHNN can retrieve various neuron states with the lowest minimum energy. Subsequent simulations performed on the MHNN reveal that the approach yields a result that surpasses the conventional hybrid HNN.

As all EDAs, compact algorithms build and update a probabilistic model of the distribution of solutions within the search space, as opposed to population-based algorithms that instead make use of an explicit population of solutions. In addition to that, to keep their memory consumption low, compact algorithms purposely employ simple probabilistic models that can be described with a small number of parameters. Despite their simplicity, compact algorithms have shown good performances on a broad range of benchmark functions and real-world problems. However, compact algorithms also come with some drawbacks, i.e. they tend to premature convergence and show poorer performance on non-separable problems. To overcome these limitations, here we investigate a possible algorithmic scheme obtained by combining compact algorithms with a non-disruptive restart mechanism taken from the literature, named Re-Sampled Inheritance (RI). The resulting compact algorithms with RI are tested on the CEC 2014 benchmark functions. The numerical results show on the one hand that the use of RI consistently enhances the performances of compact algorithms, still keeping a limited usage of memory. On the other hand, our experiments show that among the tested algorithms, the best performance is obtained by compact Differential Evolution with RI.",

        "description": "Sparse unmixing has become a popular tool for hyperspectral imagery interpretation. It refers to finding the optimal subset of a spectral library to reconstruct the image data and further estimate the proportions of different materials. Recently, multi-objective based sparse unmixing methods have presented promising performance because of their advantages in addressing combinatorial problems. A spectral and multi-objective based sparse unmixing (SMoSU) algorithm was proposed in our previous work, which solves the decision-making problem well. However, it does not show outstanding advantages in strong noise cases. To solve the problem, in this paper, SMoSU is improved based on the estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). The machine learning based EDAs have been a reliable approach in solving multi-objective problems. However, most of them are for special problems and relatively weak in theoretical foundations. Thus, it is unreliable to extend it directly to sparse unmixing. Here, we improve EDA on the basis of classification and propose a classification-based model for individual generating under the framework of SMoSU (CM-MoSU). In CM-MoSU, the whole population is divided to be positive and negative. Then, the macroinformation of positive individuals is used to guide the generation of new individuals. Therefore, the optimization task could pay more attention to the feasible space with high quality. Moreover, some theoretical analyses are presented to prove the reliability of CM-MoSU. In experiments, several state-of-the-art sparse unmixing algorithms are compared. Both synthetic and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CM-MoSU.",

        "description": "Animal communication impacts many kinds of behavior including mating and courtship, escaping from predators and foraging activity. In this article, our investigation focuses primarily on how alarm communication impacts foraging activity, using individual based computer simulations. We used this approach to help resolve a debate in the literature between the risk-allocation hypothesis, which predicts that over time, animals become habituated to alarm communication versus the hypothesis that alarm communication consistently decreases foraging activity to avoid predators. We found that in most cases, alarm communication did indeed decrease foraging activity whereas in other cases, alarm communication resulted in habituation and a gradual increase in foraging activity, suggesting that there is some truth to both hypotheses. Moreover, it is possible that a decrease in foraging as well as habituation in response to alarm communication both contribute to fitness, or more generally, that alarm communication contributes to fitness as opposed to non-communication. Among the communication runs, we found that although there were higher levels of fitness compared with non-communication runs, fitness was higher when communication results in decreased foraging activity vs. runs where communication results in increased foraging activity. Finally, we used a variational autoencoder based estimation of distribution algorithms in conjuction with C4.5 decision trees as a wrapper to discern the features that distinguish communication runs from non-communication runs. In general, communication runs tend to have relatively low population densities, whereas non-communication runs tend to have relatively high population densities, suggesting that the ability to communicate fear obviates the need for prey to stay in close proximity to one another in order to defend against predators. Also a high level of reproductive urgency was observed in individuals with communication ability when the level of fear of predators was low.",
