        "description": "Max-cut is one of the most classic NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. The symmetry nature of it leads to special difficulty in extracting meaningful configuration information for learning; none of the state-of-the-art algorithms has employed any learning operators. This paper proposes an original learning method for max-cut, namely post-flip edge-state learning (PF-ESL). Different from previous algorithms, PF-ESL regards edge-states (cut or not cut) rather than vertex-positions as the critical information of a configuration, and extracts their statistics over a population for learning. It is based on following observations. 1) Edges are the only factors considered by the objective function. 2) Edge-states keep invariant when rotating a local configuration to its symmetry position, but vertex-positions do not. These suggest that edge-states contain more meaningful information about a configuration than vertex-positions do. It is impossible to set the state of an edge without influencing some other edges' states due to their dependencies. Therefore, instead of setting edge-states directly, PF-ESL samples the flips on vertices. Flips on vertices are sampled according to their capacities in increasing the similarity on edge-states between the given solution and a population. PF-ESL is employed in an EDA (Estimation of Distribution Algorithm) perturbation operator and a path-relinking operator. Experimental results show that our algorithm is competitive, and show that edge-state learning is value-added for both the two operators.The main contributions of this paper are as follows. Firstly, previous state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms for max-cut focus on vertex positions in their evolutionary operation, this paper proposes a new and more reasonable perspective suggesting that edge-states are the critical information of divided graphs rather than vertex positions, and introduces a novel method to measure and utilize their similarities based on it. Such a perspective is fundamental to learning based algorithms design for max-cut and other graph partitioning problems, and can shed lights on future researches. Furthermore, since max-cut is one of the most classic and fundamental NP hard problems, many real-world problems involve dividing graph data into different parts to optimize certain functions, this new perspective may inspire related or similar problems. Secondly, besides the original edge-states based perspective, and the post-flip edge-states learning (PFESL) operator based on it, our memetic algorithm also incorporates a novel evolutionary framework which alternates between EDA based Iterated Tabu search (ITS) and path relinking based genetic algorithm. Finally, the proposed algorithm provides competitive results on two mostly used benchmark sets and improves the best-known results of 6 most challenging instances.",

        "authors": "Witt, Carsten",
        "description": "The benefits of using crossover in crossing fitness gaps have been studied extensively in evolutionary computation. Recent runtime results show that majority-vote crossover is particularly efficient at optimizing the well-known JUMP benchmark function that includes a fitness gap next to the global optimum. Also estimation-of-distribution algorithms (EDAs), which use an implicit crossover, are much more efficient on JUMP than typical mutation -based algorithms. However, the allowed gap size for polynomial runtimes with EDAs is at most logarithmic in the problem dimension n.In this paper, we investigate variants of the JUMP function where the gap is shifted and appears in the middle of the typical search trajectory. Such gaps can still be overcome efficiently in time O(n log n) by majority-vote crossover and an estimation-of-distribution algorithm, even for gap sizes almost root n. However, if the global optimum is located in the gap instead of the usual all-ones string, majority-vote crossover would nevertheless approach the all-ones string and be highly inefficient. In sharp contrast, an EDA can still find such a shifted optimum efficiently. Thanks to a general property called fair sampling, the EDA will with high probability sample from almost every fitness level of the function, including levels in the gap, and sample the global optimum even though the overall search trajectory points towards the all-ones string. Finally, we derive limits on the gap size allowing efficient runtimes for the EDA.(c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

        "description": "To fully exploit the strong exploitation of differential evolution (DE) and the strong exploration of the estimation-of-distribution algorithm (EDA), an improved differential evolution by hybridizing the estimation-of-distribution algorithm named IDE-EDA is proposed in the study. Firstly, a novel cooperative evolutionary framework is proposed to hybridize LSHADE-RSP, a state-of-the-art DE variant incorporating DE-based effective improvement strategies, with EDA. Secondly, the dominant individuals generated by LSHADE-RSP are used to establish the probability distribution model for EDA to enhance its exploitation in each generation, and a new control parameter is introduced to balance exploitation and exploration. Then, the use of greed strategy works via EDA to fully retain highquality solutions to the next generation to improve the convergence speed. Finally, the greedy strategy is used to shrink the external archive when its size decreases due to the reduction of the population size. A comparison of IDE-EDA with cutting-edge DE-based and EDA-based variants, including AAVS-EDA, EB-LSHADE, ELSHADE-SPACMA, jSO, LSHADE-RSP, RWGEDA, HSES, and APGSK-IMODE, was implemented to verify its efficiency. The statistical test results on the IEEE CEC 2018 and IEEE CEC 2021 test suites demonstrate that IDE-EDA is an excellent hybrid algorithm.

        "authors": "Eisenring, Claudia Oliver, Sophy E. Khatiwala, Samar de Souza, Gregory F.",
        "description": "Biogeochemical model behaviour for micronutrients is typically hard to constrain because of the sparsity of observational data, the difficulty of determining parameters in situ, and uncertainties in observations and models. Here, we assess the influence of data distribution, model uncertainty, and the misfit function on objective parameter optimisation in a model of the oceanic cycle of zinc (Zn), an essential micronutrient for marine phytoplankton with a long whole-ocean residence time. We aim to investigate whether observational constraints are sufficient for reconstruction of biogeochemical model behaviour, given that the Zn data coverage provided by the GEOTRACES Intermediate Data Product 2017 is sparse. Furthermore, we aim to assess how optimisation results are affected by the choice of the misfit function and by confounding factors such as analytical uncertainty in the data or biases in the model related to either seasonal variability or the larger-scale circulation. The model framework applied herein combines a marine Zn cycling model with a state-of-the-art estimation of distribution algorithm (Covariance Matrix Adaption Evolution Strategy, CMA-ES) to optimise the model towards synthetic data in an ensemble of 26 optimisations. Provided with a target field that can be perfectly reproduced by the model, optimisation retrieves parameter values perfectly regardless of data coverage. As differences between the model and the system underlying the target field increase, the choice of the misfit function can greatly impact optimisation results, while limitation of data coverage is in most cases of subordinate significance. In cases where optimisation to full or limited data coverage produces relatively distinct model behaviours, we find that applying a misfit metric that compensates for differences in data coverage between ocean basins considerably improves agreement between optimisation results obtained with the two data situations.",

        "description": "This paper addresses the robust job-shop scheduling problems (RJSSP) with stochastic deteriorating processing times by considering the resilience of the production schedule. To deal with the disturbances caused by the processing time variations, the expected deviation between the realized makespan and the initial makespan is adopted to measure the robustness of a schedule. A surrogate model for robust scheduling is proposed, which can optimize both the schedule performance and robustness of RJSSP. Specifically, the computational burden of simulation is considered a deficiency for robustness evaluation under the disturbance of stochastic processing times. Therefore, a resilience-based surrogate robustness measure (SRM-R) is provided for the robustness estimation in the surrogate model. The proposed SRM-R considers the production resilience and can utilize the available information on stochastic deteriorating processing times and slack times in the schedule structure by analyzing the disturbance propagation of the correlated operations in the schedule. Finally, a multi-objective hybrid estimation of distribution algorithm is employed to obtain the Pareto optimal solutions of RJSSP. The simulation experiment results show that the presented SRM-R is effective and can provide the Pareto solutions with a lower computational burden. Furthermore, an RJSSP case derived from the manufacturing environment demonstrates that the proposed approach can generate satisfactory robust solutions with significantly improved computational efficiency.",

The control vector representing the inputs is parameterized via different interpolation methods, and an Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) that implements mixtures of probability models is presented. To satisfy the terminal conditions, which are represented as non-linear inequality constraints, several feasibility conserving mechanisms associated with learning and sampling methods of the EDAs are proposed, which guarantee the feasibility of the explored solutions. They include a particular implementation of a clustering algorithm, outlier detection, and several heuristic mapping methods. The combination of the proposed operators guides the optimization process in achieving the optimal solution by surfing the regions of the search domain associated with feasible solutions.

        "description": "As low-carbon and sustainable manufacturing becomes the mainstream development direction of the current manufacturing industry, the traditional heavy industry manufacturing enterprises in China urgently need to transform. For the heavy cement equipment manufacturing enterprise investigated here, there is a large amount of energy waste during the manufacturing operation due to scheduling confusion. In particular, the multispeed, multi-function machining and the transportation of multiple automated guided vehicles (multi-AGV) are the main influencing factors. Therefore, this paper addresses a novel low-carbon scheduling optimization problem that integrated multispeed flexible manufacturing and multi-AGV transportation (LCSP-MSFM &amp; MAGVT). First, a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model is established to minimize the comprehensive energy consumption and makespan in this problem. In the MIP model, a time-node model is built to describe the completion time per workpiece, and a comprehensive energy consumption model based on the operation process of the machine and the AGV is established. Then, a distribution algorithm with a low-carbon scheduling heuristic strategy (EDA-LSHS) is estimated to solve the proposed MIP model. In EDA-LSHS, the EDA with a novel probability model is used as the main algorithm, and the LSHS is presented to guide the search direction of the EDA. Finally, the optimization effect and actual performance of the proposed method are verified in a case study. The experimental results show that the application of the proposed method in actual production can save an average of 43.52% comprehensive energy consumption and 64.43% makespan, which effectively expands the low-carbon manufacturing capacity of the investigated enterprise.",

        "description": "Point-set registration is widely used in computer vision and pattern recognition. However, it has become a challenging problem since the current registration algorithms suffer from the complexities of the point-set distributions. To solve this problem, we propose a robust registration algorithm based on the estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) to optimize the complex distributions from a global search mechanism. We propose an EDA probability model based on the asymmetric generalized Gaussian mixture model, which describes the area in the solution space as comprehensively as possible and constructs a probability model of complex distribution points, especially for missing and outliers. We propose a transformation and a Gaussian evolution strategy in the selection mechanism of EDA to process the deformation, rotation, and denoising of selected dominant individuals. Considering the complexity of the model, we choose to optimize from the perspective of variational Bayesian, and introduce a prior probability distribution through local variation to reinforce the convergence of the algorithm in dealing with complex point sets. In addition, a local search mechanism based on the simulated annealing algorithm is added to realize the coarse-to-fine registration. Experimental results show that our method has the best robustness compared with the state-of-the-art registration algorithms.",

Accordingly, we here present an enhanced restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM)-driven interactive estimation of distribution algorithms (IEDAs) with multisource heterogeneous data from the viewpoint of effectively extracting users' preferences and requirements from UGCs to strengthen the performance of IEDA for personalized search. The multisource heterogeneous UGCs, including users' ratings and reviews, items' category tags, social networks, and other available information, are sufficiently collected and represented to construct an RBM-based model to extract users' comprehensive preferences. With this RBM, the probability model for conducting the reproduction operator of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) and the surrogate for quantitatively evaluating an individual (item) fitness are further developed to enhance the EDA-based personalized search. The UGCs-driven IEDA is applied to various publicly released Amazon datasets, e.g., recommendation of Digital Music, Apps for Android, Movies, and TV, to experimentally demonstrate its performance in efficiently improving the IEDA in personalized search with less interactions and higher satisfaction.",

Comprehensive numerical experiments with instances built from a real-world scenario validate the proposed model and algorithm.

The experimental study suggests that the new components are more efficient than those in RM-MEDA when using the regularity model.

        "description": "In recent decades, Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) have gained much popularity in the evolutionary computation community for solving optimization problems. Characterized by the use of probabilistic models to represent the solutions and the interactions between the variables of the problem, EDAs can be applied to either discrete, continuous or mixed domain problems. Due to this robustness, these algorithms have been used to solve a diverse set of real-world and academic optimization problems. However, a straightforward application is only limited to a few cases, and for the general case, an efficient application requires intuition from the problem as well as notable understanding in probabilistic modeling. In this paper, we provide a roadmap for solving optimization problems via EDAs. It is not the aim of the paper to provide a thorough review of EDAs, but to present a guide for those practitioners interested in using the potential of EDAs when solving optimization problems. In order to present a roadmap which is as useful as possible, we address the key aspects involved in the design and application of EDAs, in a sequence of stages: (1) the choice of the codification, (2) the choice of the probability model, (3) strategies to incorporate knowledge about the problem to the model, and (4) balancing the diversification-intensification behavior of the EDA. At each stage, first, the contents are presented together with common practices and advice to follow. Then, an illustration is given with an example which shows different alternatives.

Estimation of the distribution algorithm (EDA) has recently been recognized as a prominent metaheuristic methodology in the field of evolutionary computation due to its excellent performance of global exploration. In this article, an innovative matrix-cube-based (i.e., 3-D) EDA (MCEDA) is first proposed to minimize the total earliness and tardiness (TET) of the NFSSP with SDSTs and RTs. This problem is NP-hard in the strong sense. First, a 3-D matrix cube is devised to learn the valuable information from promising solutions or excellent individuals. Second, an EDA model or probabilistic model based on the matrix cube and a special sampling method is presented to perform effective exploration in solution space and find promising regions. Third, based on a series of newly defined subneighborhoods, a new local search with both a speed-up scanning method and one search strategy is developed to execute exploitation from promising regions. Fourth, a speed-up evaluation method based on the problem's property is designed to reduce the computational complexity for calculating criterion and accelerate the search process. Owing to the reasonable hybridization of exploration and exploitation, MCEDA can perform very efficient search in solution space. Extensive test results on instances of such a just-in-time problem first show that MCEDA can achieve better solution than state-of-the-art algorithms in obviously less computation time. Additional experiments on instances of various NFSSPs further confirm the efficiency and robustness of MCEDA.",

        "description": "As global search techniques, population-based optimization algorithms have provided promising results in feature selection (FS) problems. However, their major challenge is high time complexity associated with the exploration of a large search space and consequently a large number of fitness function evaluations. Moreover, the interaction between features is another key issue in FS problems, directly affecting the classification per-formance through selecting correlated features. In this paper, an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA)-based method is proposed with three important contributions. Firstly, as an extension of EDA, the proposed method in each iteration generates only two individuals competing based on a fitness function, evolving during the algorithm using our proposed update procedure. Secondly, we provide a guiding technique to determine the number of features to be selected for individuals in each iteration. As a result, the number of selected features in the final solution would be optimized during the evolution process. These two would lead to increasing the convergence speed of the algorithm. Thirdly, as the main contribution of the paper, in addition to considering the importance of each feature alone, the proposed method can consider the interaction between features, being able to deal with complementary features and consequently increase classification performance. To do this, we provide a conditional probability scheme that considers the joint probability distribution of selecting two fea-tures. The introduced probabilities successfully detect correlated features. Experimental results on a synthetic dataset with correlated features proved the performance of our proposed approach facing these types of features. Furthermore, the results on 13 real-world datasets obtained from the UCI repository showed the superiority of the proposed method in comparison with some state-of-the-art approaches. To evaluate the effectiveness of each feature subset, support vector machines are used as classifier. The efficiency analysis of the experimental results using two non-parametric statistical tests proved that the proposed method had significant advantages in com-parison to other approaches.",

Firstly, the non-dominated solutions obtained in past environments are utilized to predict high-quality solutions based on a multi-step movement strategy.

It first caches m optimized intermediate solutions from the first m users, which can be reused by other users to get the final optimal solution. Moreover, a multipopulation Estimation of Distribution Algorithm is used to reduce the probability of falling into a local optimum, and the roulette mechanism is used to accelerate the optimization process. Extensive simulations are conducted based on the real-world dataset. The results show that the proposed mechanism achieves higher quality, better stability, and shorter execution time compared with other schemes.",

        "description": "Electronic vehicles (EVs) are receiving increasing attention to addressing global warming challenges since fossil fuel is replaced with fuel cell technology. Hence, new challenges arise as demands have increased for using EVs. One of these challenges is the long waiting time of charging EVs spent in queues, especially during peak hours. So, in this study, we aim to propose an efficient method for the electric vehicle charging scheduling problem (EVCSP), which an actual charging station inspires. The most important constraint in this problem is balancing power consumption between charging lines, leading to a limited number of devices that can be charged simultaneously. Also, in this problem, EVs may have interrelationships with each other during the scheduling procedure. So, the estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) as a competent method in handling the possible relations among decision variables is applied in our proposed hybrid EDA-based solving method. Our proposed method comprises two EDAs, a Markov network-based EDA and a Mallows model-based EDA. It achieves an appropriate schedule and charging line assignment simultaneously while minimizing the total tardiness considering problem constraints. We compared our method with a constraint programming (CP) model and the state-of-art meta-heuristic methods in terms of the objective function value by simulation on a benchmark dataset. Results from the experimental study show significant improvement in solving the introduced EVCSPs.",

In MCEDA's global search, a matrix cube is devised to reasonably learn the promising patterns in excellent solutions or individuals, and then a matrix-cube-based probabilistic model is developed to quickly guide global search toward the potential promising regions in solution space. A diversity controlling mechanism is also added to avoid the stagnation of global search.

To cope with this NP-hard problem with high complexity, a variety of evolutionary computation (EC) techniques has been developed. To improve the effectiveness and efficiency of these techniques, in this article, we proposed a novel memetic estimation of the distribution algorithm-based approach, namely, MEEDA, to tackle this problem. In particular, MEEDA explores four different domain-dependent local search methods that search for effective composite services by utilizing several neighborhood structures. Apart from that, to significantly reduce the computational time of MEEDA, an efficient local search strategy is introduced by combining a uniform fitness distribution scheme for selecting suitable solutions and stochastic local search operators for effectively and efficiently exploiting neighbors. To better demonstrate MEEDA's effectiveness and scalability, we create a more challenging, augmented version of the service composition benchmark dataset. Experimental results on this benchmark show that MEEDA with newly developed domain-dependent local search operator, i.e., layer-based constrained one-point swaps, significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms in finding high-quality composite services.",

At present, the models based on the fusion of various optimization algorithms and neural networks have become one of the emerging techniques for accurate fault identification. Firstly, an improved antlion optimizer (ALO) algorithm based on estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) and variable-step Levy flight strategy, abbreviated as ELALO, is proposed as a new bionic intelligence. During the initialization of population, the individuals with poor fitness are redistributed by the Gaussian probability model. In view of the stagnation of iteration, Levy flight strategy is introduced and the adaptive change of disturbance step length is controlled. Experimental results on 4 benchmark functions show that the novel ELALO can effectively improve the solution accuracy and convergence speed, compared with the original ALO. Secondly, in order to solve the disadvantage that extreme learning machine (ELM) network is easy to fall into local optimization, this ELALO algorithm is used to initialize the weights and thresholds of its network and to form the new pattern recognition model, ELALO-ELM. Finally, the bearing data of 8 patterns from Western Reserve University are decomposed by local mean decomposition (LMD), and then the symbolic entropy (SE) of the first three product function (PF) components signals is extracted and used as the input eigenvectors. Compared with the standard ELM and ALO-ELM models, the ELALO-ELM model has better generalization and stronger robustness and it can effectively improve the efficiency of network training and the accuracy of early fault pattern classification in bearing fault diagnosis. The new ELALO-ELM model can also be used for other difficult classification problems.",

        "description": "History matching can estimate the parameter of spatially varying geological properties and provide reliable numerical models for reservoir development and management. However, in practice, high-dimension, multiple-solutions and computational cost are key issues that restrict the application of history matching methods. Recently, the combination of deep-learning-based surrogate model and sampling algorithm has been widely studied in history matching to overcome the limitations. Considering that real-world large-scale reservoirs often have hundreds of thousands or even millions of grid-based uncertain parameters, extracting spatial features using convolutional neural networks requires a lot of computational cost and storage requirements. Therefore, in this work, we mainly study how to use the recurrent neural network (RNN) to construct the surrogate model for history matching. Specifically, we propose a multilayer RNN surrogate model based on a vector-to-sequence modeling framework. The multilayer RNN surrogate model with gated recurrent unit (GRU), termed MLGRU, is developed to approximate the mapping from feature vector of geological realizations to the production data. The feature vector is the low-dimensional representation of geological parameter fields after using the re-parameterization method, while production data are the simulation results of historical period. In addition, we design a log-transformation-based windowed normalization (LTWN) method for the production data, which can enhance the learnability and features of production data. The MLGRU model is incorporated into a multi -modal estimation of distribution algorithm (MEDA) to formulate a history matching workflow. The hyper-parameters and performance of the proposed MLGRU model are analyzed by numerical experiments on a 2D reservoir model. Furthermore, numerical experiments performed on the Brugge benchmark model, a large-scale 3D reservoir model, demonstrated the performance of the proposed surrogate model and history matching method.",

In detail, we transform the distribution estimation problem into a clustering problem by determining the probability of each data belonging to each component (each cluster as well). A hybrid estimation of distribution algorithm is proposed to intelligently solve the clustering problem with the criterion to optimize quality and simplicity simultaneously. First, to optimize the simplicity, problem-specific encoding and decoding methods are designed. Second, to generate initial solutions with good clustering results, a Chinese restaurant process-based initialization mechanism is presented.

        "description": "Various applications of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in urban environments facilitate our daily life and public services. However, UAV operations bring third party risk (TPR) issues, as UAV may crash to pedestrians and vehicles on the ground. It may also cause property damages to critical infrastructures and noise impacts to the public. Path planning is an effective method to mitigate these risks and impacts by avoiding high-risk areas before flight. However, most of the existing path planning methods focus on minimizing flight distance or energy cost, rarely considered risk cost. This paper develops a novel flight path optimization method that considers an integrated cost assessment model. The assessment model incorporates fatality risk, property damage risk, and noise impact, which is an extension of current TPR indicators at modeling and assessment levels. To solve the proposed integrated cost-based path optimization problem, a hybrid estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) and CostA* (named as EDA-CostA*) algorithm is proposed, which provides both global and local heuristic information for path searching in cost-based environments.

        "description": "Power system reliability evaluation plays a vital role in the planning and operation studies by reflecting the system safety level. In this paper, a combination of a non-sequential Monte Carlo simulation (MCS)-based model and an improved Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) is exploited for evaluating the reliability of the composite power systems considering variability and uncertainty of wind farms (WFs) and Photovoltaic (PV) units. Variability of these resources is defined as the random fluctuation of wind speed and solar irradiation caused by changes in the atmosphere, while their uncertainty results from output power forecast errors. In the proposed model, the states of traditional generating units, transmission lines, WFs, and PV units are constructed using non-sequential MCS. These states can be achieved based on the component failure probability for dispatchable traditional generators and transmission lines along with the Probability Distribution Functions (PDFs) of renewable generations. To enhance the computational efficiency of the MCS in the sampling step, the improved EDA upgraded with the Population-Based Incremental Learning (PBIL) algorithm is employed. The proposed mathematical model for reliability evaluation of composite power system is applied to the IEEE RTS 24-bus system, and numerical studies are performed under several case studies. The simulation results confirm the proficiency of the proposed method to improve the computational efficiency, while the high accuracy of reliability evaluation of the composite power system is attained.",

        "description": "The environments of the dynamic multiobjective optimization problems (DMOPs), such as Pareto optimal front (POF) or Pareto optimal set (POS), usually frequently change with the evolution process. This kind of problem poses a higher challenge for evolutionary algorithms because it requires the population to quickly track (i.e., con -verge) to the position of a new environment and be widely distributed in the search space. The prediction-based response mechanism is a commonly used method to deal with environmental changes, but it's only suitable for predictable changes. Moreover, the imbalance of population diversity and convergence in the process of tracking the dynamically changing POF has aggravated. In this paper, we proposed a new change response mechanism that combines a hybrid prediction strategy and a precision controllable mutation strategy (HPPCM) to solve the DMOPs. Specifically, the hybrid prediction strategy coordinates the center point-based prediction and the guiding individual-based prediction to make accurate predictions. Thus, the population can quickly adapt to the predictable environmental changes. Additionally, the precision controllable mutation strategy handles un-predictable environmental changes. It improves the diversity exploration of the population by controlling the variation degree of solutions. In this way, our change response mechanism can adapt to various environmental changes of DMOPs, such as predictable and unpredictable changes. This paper integrates the HPPCM mecha-nism into a prevalent regularity model-based multiobjective estimation of distribution algorithm (RM-MEDA) to optimize DMOPs. The results of comparative experiments with some state-of-the-art algorithms on various test instances have demonstrated the effectiveness and competitiveness of the change response mechanism proposed in this paper.",

In this work, a structural damage identification (SDI) framework based on the estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) is proposed and applied to the damage identification of a single-layer cylindrical latticed shell. Numerical simulations and laboratory tests are performed. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed damage identification algorithm. Only four accelerometer locations from 38 available points are used to identify the damage of the test structure with 83 members. The average identification accuracy using FE data reaches 90% by considering multiple damage conditions and noise interference. Based on the laboratory data, the average identification accuracy is over 82% considering different damage levels of a single member.

        "description": "Automatic history matching (AHM) has been widely studied in petroleum engineering due to it can provide reliable numerical models for reservoir development and management. However, AHM is still a challenging problem because it usually involves running a great deal of time-consuming numerical simulations during the solving process. To address this issue, this article studies a hybrid recurrent convolutional network (HRCN) model for surrogate modeling of numerical simulation used in AHM. The HRCN model is end-to-end trainable for predicting the well production data of high-dimensional parameter fields. In HRCN, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is first developed to learn the high-level spatial feature representations of the input parameter fields. Following that, a recurrent neural network (RNN) is constructed with the purpose of modeling complex temporal dynamics and predicting the production data. In addition, given that the fluctuations of production data are influenced by well control measures, the well control parameters are used as auxiliary inputs of RNN. Moreover, the proposed surrogate model is incorporated into a multimodal estimation of distribution algorithm (MEDA) to formulate a novel surrogate-based AHM workflow. The numerical studies performed on a 2D and a 3D reservoir model illustrate the performance of the proposed surrogate model and history matching workflow. Compared with the MEDA using only numerical simulations, the surrogate-based AHM workflow significantly reduces the computational cost.",

To alleviate this issue, this paper proposes a layered learning estimation of distribution algorithm (LLEDA) by maintaining multiple probability distribution models. Specifically, LLEDA first separates the population into several layers based on fitness. Then, the mean position of each layer is computed. Subsequently, we let the estimated mean position in each lower layer randomly learn from the one of a randomly selected higher layer, so that the mean positions of lower layers could be promoted to be close to promising areas found in the current population. At last, the covariance of each layer is estimated based on the generated new mean position and the individuals in this layer. By this means, multiple probability models with high quality are maintained and then are used to sample promising and diversified offspring separately. Comparative experiments conducted on a widely used benchmark problem set demonstrate that the proposed LLEDA achieves competitive or even much better performance than several state-of-the-art and representative EDAs.",

In each generation, they build a probabilistic model representing the promising individuals, and the next generation constructs by sampling this model. Constructing and sampling the probabilistic model is a real challenge in developing such algorithms. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a popular kind of generative model that has been widely adopted due to their ability to generate new samples that closely match the distribution of training data. However, research on how GANs handle permutation spaces is lacking. We suggest a novel Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) that uses GANs as a probabilistic model estimator to advance this subject. in order to preserve the information captured from the selected individuals, those promising individuals were represented by a one-hot matrix, then used to train GANs.

In this work, we argue that the purely academic question of what could be the best possible algorithm in a certain broad class of black-box optimizers can give fruitful indications in which direction to search for good established optimization heuristics. We demonstrate this approach on the recently proposed DLB benchmark, for which the only known results are O (n(3)) runtimes for several classic evolutionary algorithms and an O (n(2) log n) runtime for an estimation-of-distribution algorithm. Our finding that the unary unbiased black-box complexity is only O (n(2)) suggests the Metropolis algorithm as an interesting candidate and we prove that it solves the DLB problem in quadratic time. Since we also prove that better runtimes cannot be obtained in the class of unary unbiased algorithms, we shift our attention to algorithms that use the information of more parents to generate new solutions. An artificial algorithm of this type having an O (n log n) runtime leads to the result that the significance-based compact genetic algorithm sig-cGA) can solve the DLB problem also in time O (n log n).",

        "description": "The compact genetic algorithm (cGA) is a non-elitist estimation of distribution algorithm which has shown to be able to deal with difficult multimodal fitness landscapes that are hard to solve by elitist algorithms. In this paper, we investigate the cGA on the Cliff function for which it has been shown recently that non-elitist evolutionary algorithms and artificial immune systems optimize it in expected polynomial time. We point out that the cGA faces major difficulties when solving the Cliff function and investigate its dynamics both experimentally and theoretically around the Cliff. Our experimental results indicate that the cGA requires exponential time for all values of the update strength... We show theoretically that, under sensible assumptions, there is a negative drift when sampling around the location of the cliff. Experiments further suggest that there is a phase transition for.. where the expected optimization time drops from n Theta((n)) to 2 Theta((n)).",

        "description": "Inspired by the recent 11th Global Trajectory Optimisation Competition, this paper presents the asteroid routing problem (ARP) as a realistic benchmark of algorithms for expensive bound-constrained black-box optimization in permutation space. Given a set of asteroids' orbits and a departure epoch, the goal of the ARP is to find the optimal sequence for visiting the asteroids, starting from Earth's orbit, in order to minimize both the cost, measured as the sum of the magnitude of velocity changes required to complete the trip, and the time, measured as the time elapsed from the departure epoch until visiting the last asteroid. We provide open-source code for generating instances of arbitrary sizes and evaluating solutions to the problem. As a preliminary analysis, we compare the results of two methods for expensive blackbox optimization in permutation spaces, namely, Combinatorial Efficient Global Optimization (CEGO), a Bayesian optimizer based on Gaussian processes, and Unbalanced Mallows Model (UMM), an estimation-of-distribution algorithm based on probabilistic Mallows models. We investigate the best permutation representation for each algorithm, either rank-based or order-based. Moreover, we analyze the effect of providing a good initial solution, generated by a greedy nearest neighbor heuristic, on the performance of the algorithms. The results suggest directions for improvements in the algorithms being compared.",

Therefore, the job-shop scheduling problem continues being attractive in developing new evolutionary algorithms. In this paper, the authors propose a new estimation of distribution algorithm coupled with a radial probability function. The aforementioned radial function comes from the hydrogen element. This approach is proposed in order to build a competitive evolutionary algorithm for the job-shop scheduling problem. The key point is to exploit the radial probability distribution to construct offspring and to tackle the inconvenient of the EDAs (i.e., lack of diversity of the solutions and poor ability of exploitation). Various instances and numerical experiments are presented to illustrate and to validate this novel research. The results, obtained from this research, permit the conclusion that using radial probability distributions is an emerging field to develop new and efficient EDAs.",

We employ the parameter-free copula estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) that optimally controls the reactive power of DERs to minimize voltage deviations. EDAs iteratively learn from data and sample an explicit probability distribution that models the dependencies between variables, allowing for a more effective exploration of the optimal solution space with fewer iterations. A copula offers additional flexibility, since the dependence structure between the decision variables and the marginal distributions can be modeled independently. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated on a modified IEEE 123 node test feeder with 10 smart photovoltaic inverters. The results show that the proposed method achieves improved voltage profiles and offers many opportunities for further adaptability.",

        "description": "During recent years, the outpatient scheduling problem has attracted much attention from both academic and medical fields. This paper considers the outpatient scheduling problem as an extension of the flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSP), where each patient is considered as one job. Two realistic constraints, i.e., switching and preparation times of patients are considered simultaneously. To solve the outpatient scheduling problem, a hybrid imperialist competitive algorithm (HICA) is proposed. In the proposed algorithm, first, the mutation strategy with different mutation probabilities is utilized to generate feasible and efficient solutions. Then, the diversified assimilation strategy is developed. The enhanced global search heuristic, which includes the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm and estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA), is adopted in the assimilation strategy to improve the global search ability of the algorithm. Moreover, four kinds of neighborhood search strategies are introduced to generate new promising solutions. Finally, the empires invasion strategy is proposed to increase the diversity of the population. To verify the performance of the proposed HICA, four efficient algorithms, including imperialist competitive algorithm, improved genetic algorithm, EDA, and modified artificial immune algorithm, are selected for detailed comparisons. The simulation results confirm that the proposed algorithm can solve the outpatient scheduling problem with high efficiency.",

        "description": "With the rapid development of the insurance industry, more diverse insurance products are produced for consumers. Insurance portfolio problems have received increasing attention. While most studies focus on insurance portfolio problem for a single insured, insurance portfolio problems for a specific group of insured are even more intricate but little attention has been paid to. In this article, we propose a group insurance portfolio model for investment allocation of several insurance policies so that the total payout of the whole group can be maximized. The statistical average value of each parameter is considered in the model to approximate the expectation payout of the group insurance portfolio problem. To solve this problem, a coevolutionary estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) utilizing the divide-and-conquer strategy is proposed. First, as the payout of each insured under a certain portfolio plan can be calculated separately, the proposed approach decomposes the group insurance portfolio problem into several single-insured insurance portfolio problems. In this way, the dimension of the optimization problem becomes lower compared to the original problem. An adaptive EDA is proposed to optimize the portfolio plan of each insured independently. Second, the group insurance portfolio problem remains a nonseparable problem since the investment amount of each insured is limited by the total investable amount of the whole group. A particle swarm optimization algorithm is adopted to cooperate with the EDA to optimize the proportion of allocation to each insured. The proposed algorithm is verified on various scenarios. The experimental results validate that the proposed approach is effective for the group insurance portfolio problem.",

This model considers two states, susceptible and infected, divides the population into sexes, assumes only heterosexual contacts and includes different transmission rates depending on whether the transmission is woman-man or man-woman. Reported and prevalence series data are retrieved from several sources. We consider the inherent data survey errors and the sensitivity of the diagnosis tests (data uncertainty). To calibrate the model to the available data and their uncertainty, a novel technique is proposed in two steps: (1) the application of the estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) to find sets of model parameter values close to the data uncertainty and (2) the application of a selection algorithm to get a reduced number of model parameter values whose model outputs capture accurately the data uncertainty. Then, we check its robustness, and we provide a prediction of the evolution of the infected over the next 4 years. From the technical point of view, we conclude that the proposed technique to calibrate probabilistically the model is reliable and robust. Also, it is able to provide confidence intervals for the model parameter values and the predictions. From the medical point of view, the model returns that the transmission woman-man is higher than the man-woman, according to recent literature, and there is a mild increasing trend in the number of infected people over the next years.",

These problems are challenging and well known by the dynamic nature of their objective functions, constraint functions, and problem parameters which often change over time. In fact, dealing with these problems has not been investigated in detail using the Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs). Thus, we propose in this paper an EDA-based on Vine Copulas algorithm to deal with Dynamic Multiobjective Problems (DMOPs). Vines Copulas are graphical models that represent multivariate dependence using bivariate copulas. The proposed Copula-based Estimation of Distribution Algorithm, labeled Dynamic Vine-Copula Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (DynVC-EDA), is used to implement two search strategies. The first strategy is an algorithm that uses the model as a memory to save the status of the best solutions obtained during the current generation. The second strategy is a prediction-based algorithm that uses the history of the best solutions to predict a new population when a change occurs. The proposed algorithms are tested using a set of benchmarks provided with CEC2015 and the Gee-Tan-Abbass.

Some inverse-model-based approaches were reported, such as inversed-model of multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (IM-MOEA), where an inverse functional mapping from Pareto-Front to Pareto-solution is constructed on nondominated solutions based on Gaussian process and random grouping technique. But some of the effective inverse models, during this process, may be removed. This paper proposes an inversed-model based on random forest framework. The main idea is to apply the process of random forest variable importance that determines some of the best assignment of decision variables (x(n)) to objective functions (f(m)) for constructing Gaussian process in inversed-models that map all nondominated solutions from the objective space to the decision space. In this work, three approaches have been used: classical permutation, Naive testing approach, and novel permutation variable importance.

At each generation, the idea is to flexibly identify promising properties of the parent population and to transfer these properties to the offspring where the DAE-GP uses denoising to make the model robust to noise that is present in the parent population. Denoising partially corrupts candidate solutions that are used as input to the model. The stronger the corruption, the stronger the generalization of the model. In this work, we study how corruption strength affects the exploration and exploitation behavior of the DAE-GP. For a generalization of the royal tree problem (high-locality problem), we find that the stronger the corruption, the stronger the exploration of the solution space. For the given problem, weak corruption resulting in a stronger exploitation of the solution space performs best. However, in more rugged fitness landscapes (low-locality problems), we expect that a stronger corruption resulting in a stronger exploration will be helpful. Choosing the right denoising strategy can therefore help to control the exploration and exploitation behavior in search, leading to an improved search quality.",

If we model an optimization problem as a Boltzmann process, the global optimum would be the most probable state. To achieve this, we propose an analytical derivation of the minimum distance to the Boltzmann distribution using the parameters and to fit this model. As a case study, we implemented the J-SIGMA methodology on three families of population-based metaheuristics: Swarm, Evolutionary, and Estimation of Distribution, and used a set of continuous optimization functions from CEC'17 to evaluate their performance against other metaheuristics of each family. Finally, from a statistical analysis of the convergence performance, the evidence is shown to affirm that the J-SIGMA methodology can significantly improve the convergence performance of the algorithms, regardless of the metaheuristic family to which it belongs.",

The farmer expects that in a specific area of the land, the physicochemical characteristics of the soil will be homogeneous as the selected crop has the desired quality and minimizes the use of fertilizers. There are three approaches to determining the correct delimitation of the land in the state-of-the art. The first one (k-means and fuzzy k-means) is impractical for current agricultural technology. The second approach is based on integer linear programming and a pre-processing step. This approach limits the shapes of delimited zones to rectangular, and the third approach extends the solution search space and generates orthogonal regions using Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDA).

Existing inverse modeling is mainly applied to solve multi-objective optimization problems and is not suitable for many-objective optimization problems. Some inversed-model techniques, such as the inversed-model of multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, constructed from the Pareto front (PF) to the Pareto solution on nondominated solutions using a random grouping method and Gaussian process, were introduced. However, some of the most efficient inverse models might be eliminated during this procedure. Also, there are challenges, such as the presence of many local PFs and developing poor solutions when the population has no evident regularity. This paper proposes inverse modeling using random forest regression and uniform reference points that map all nondominated solutions from the objective space to the decision space to solve many-objective optimization problems. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using the benchmark test suite for evolutionary algorithms. The results show an improvement in diversity and convergence performance (quality indicators).",

The success of the algorithm over a given optimization task relies on the suitability of its search heuristics for the problem-domain. Thus, the design of custom metaheuristic algorithms leads to more accurate solutions. Hyper-heuristics (HH) are important tools commonly used to select low-level heuristics (LLHs) to solve a specific problem. HH are able to acquire knowledge from the problems where they are used. However, as other artificial intelligence tools it is necessary to identify how the knowledge affects the performance of the algorithm. One way to generate such knowledge is to capture interactions between variables using probabilistic graphical models such as Bayesian networks (BN) in conjunction with estimation of distribution algorithms (EDA). This article presents a method based on that used an EDA based on BN as a high-level selection mechanism for HH called Hyper-heuristic approach based on Bayesian learning and evolutionary operators (HHBNO). Here the knowledge is extracted form BN to evolve the sequences of LLHs in an online learning process by exploring the inter-dependencies among the LLHs. The proposes approach is tested over CEC'17 set of benchmark function of single-objective real-parameter optimization. Statical tests verifies that the HHBNO presents competitive results in comparison with other metaheuristic algorithms with high performance in terms of convergence.

        "description": "The Bayesian Optimization Algorithm (BOA) is one of the most prominent Estimation of Distribution Algorithms. It can detect the correlation between multiple variables and extract knowledge on regular patterns in solutions. Bayesian Networks (BNs) are used in BOA to represent the probability distributions of the best individuals. The BN's construction is challenging since there is a trade-off between acuity and computational cost to generate it. This trade-off is determined by combining a search algorithm (SA) and a scoring metric (SM). The SA is responsible for generating a promising BN and the SM assesses the quality of such networks. Some studies have already analyzed how this relationship affects the learning process of a BN. However, such investigation had not yet been performed to determine the bond linking the selection of SA and SM and the BOA's output quality. Acting on this research gap, a detailed comparative analysis involving two constructive heuristics and four scoring metrics is presented in this work. The classic version of BOA was applied to discrete and continuous optimization problems using binary and floating-point representations. The scenarios were compared through graphical analyses, statistical metrics, and difference detection tests. The results showed that the selection of SA and SM affects the quality of the BOA results since scoring metrics that penalize complex BN models perform better than metrics that do not consider the complexity of the networks.

At each generation, the idea is to flexibly identify promising properties of the parent population and to transfer these properties to the offspring where the DAE-GP uses denoising to make the model robust to noise that is present in the parent population. Denoising partially corrupts candidate solutions that are used as input to the model. The stronger the corruption, the stronger the generalization of the model. In this work, we study how corruption strength affects the exploration and exploitation behavior of the DAE-GP. For a generalization of the royal tree problem (high-locality problem), we find that the stronger the corruption, the stronger the exploration of the solution space. For the given problem, weak corruption resulting in a stronger exploitation of the solution space performs best. However, in more rugged fitness landscapes (low-locality problems), we expect that a stronger corruption resulting in a stronger exploration will be helpful. Choosing the right denoising strategy can therefore help to control the exploration and exploitation behavior in search, leading to an improved search quality.",

At each generation, the idea is to flexibly identify promising properties of the parent population and to transfer these properties to the offspring where the DAE-GP uses denoising to make the model robust to noise that is present in the parent population. Denoising partially corrupts candidate solutions that are used as input to the model. The stronger the corruption, the stronger the generalization of the model. In this work, we study how corruption strength affects the exploration and exploitation behavior of the DAE-GP. For a generalization of the royal tree problem (high-locality problem), we find that the stronger the corruption, the stronger the exploration of the solution space. For the given problem, weak corruption resulting in a stronger exploitation of the solution space performs best. However, in more rugged fitness landscapes (low-locality problems), we expect that a stronger corruption resulting in a stronger exploration will be helpful. Choosing the right denoising strategy can therefore help to control the exploration and exploitation behavior in search, leading to an improved search quality.",

If we model an optimization problem as a Boltzmann process, the global optimum would be the most probable state. To achieve this, we propose an analytical derivation of the minimum distance to the Boltzmann distribution using the parameters and to fit this model. As a case study, we implemented the J-SIGMA methodology on three families of population-based metaheuristics: Swarm, Evolutionary, and Estimation of Distribution, and used a set of continuous optimization functions from CEC'17 to evaluate their performance against other metaheuristics of each family. Finally, from a statistical analysis of the convergence performance, the evidence is shown to affirm that the J-SIGMA methodology can significantly improve the convergence performance of the algorithms, regardless of the metaheuristic family to which it belongs.",

Bayesian Networks (BNs) are used in BOA to represent the probability distributions of the best individuals. The BN's construction is challenging since there is a trade-off between acuity and computational cost to generate it. This trade-off is determined by combining a search algorithm (SA) and a scoring metric (SM). The SA is responsible for generating a promising BN and the SM assesses the quality of such networks.

The scenarios were compared through graphical analyses, statistical metrics, and difference detection tests. The results showed that the selection of SA and SM affects the quality of the BOA results since scoring metrics that penalize complex BN models perform better than metrics that do not consider the complexity of the networks.

The high dimensionality of the texts themselves implies a larger number of network parameters and a more complex optimization surface. Artificial neural network training is an NP-Hard optimization problem, which has been addressed by methods based on partial derivatives of the objective function and presents several theoretical and practical limitations, such as the probability of convergence to local minimums. In this work, we propose a hybrid method based on the Estimation of Distribution Algorithms for training a Convolutional Neural Network. For this, we train together gradient-based methods with the Estimation of Multivariate Normal Algorithm and Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm by dividing the training process into two stages. The different variants obtained with the proposed method are compared with gradient-based methods on public benchmark datasets and statistical differences are analyzed by nonparametric tests. The proposed method increases the accuracy of the convolutional network applied to the text categorization task and overcome in about 0.22%-24% the state-of-the-art algorithms. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

In the past few decades, various techniques have been developed to deal with linear and nonlinear constraints. However, reaching feasible solutions has been a challenging task for most of these methods. In this article, we adopt the framework of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) and propose a new algorithm (EDA++) equipped with some mechanisms to deal with nonlinear constraints. These mechanisms are associated with different stages of the EDA, including seeding, learning, and mapping. It is shown that, besides increasing the quality of the solutions in terms of objective values, the feasibility of the final solutions is guaranteed if an initial population of feasible solutions is seeded to the algorithm. The EDA with the proposed mechanisms is applied to two suites of benchmark problems for constrained continuous optimization and its performance is compared with some state-of-the-art algorithms and constraint-handling methods. Conducted experiments confirm the speed, robustness, and efficiency of the proposed algorithm in tackling various problems with linear and nonlinear constraints.",

An algorithm should perform more exploration when reaching the \"ideal search scale\"; this happens when solutions are regularly sampled from different attraction basins. The moment this search scale is reached depends on the topological features of the objective function and the inherent randomness of the heuristic optimization process. Previous work on adjusting exploration have mostly used fixed rules based on fitness improvement, in this paper, we model it as a supervised machine learning problem. We apply a data-centric approach to understand whether variations in the data are more relevant than variations in the classification models. For our study we use the Estimation Multivariate Normal Algorithm with Thresheld Convergence, which provides an ideal framework as it allows us to directly control exploration through the. parameter. Optimization results show that the machine learning hybrid significantly outperforms the baseline algorithm.",

The core principle of Kriging interpolation is searching for data distribution regularity and predicting regionalised variable value, and it can be transferred into two descriptions of learning process: function fitting problem and coefficient optimisation problem. Although these two problems could be solved by many traditional algorithms like multiple linear regression method, the parameter estimation of variogram model becomes quite difficult when there are drifts or noises in the raw data. The purpose of this paper is to improve the Kriging interpolation algorithm with learning kernels based on Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) and Least-Squares Support Vector Machine (LSSVM).
