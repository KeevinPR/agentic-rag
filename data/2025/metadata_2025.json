        "description": "Optimizing well placement is one of the primary challenges in oil field development. The number and positions of wells must be carefully considered, as it is directly related to the infrastructure cost and the profits over the field's life cycle. In this paper, we propose three estimation of distribution algorithms to optimize well placement with the objective of maximizing the net present value. The methods are guided by an elite set of solutions and are able to obtain multiple local optima in a single run. We also present an auxiliary regression model to preemptively discard candidate solutions with poor performance prediction, thus avoiding running computationally expensive simulations for unpromising candidates. The model is trained with the data obtained during the search process and does not require previous training. Our algorithms yielded a significant improvement compared to a state-of-the-art reference method from the literature, as evidenced by computational experiments with two benchmarks.",

        "description": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used for image classification; however, setting the appropriate hyperparameters before training is subjective and time consuming, and the search space is not properly explored. This paper presents a novel method for the automatic neural architecture search based on an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) for binary classification problems. The hyperparameters were coded in binary form due to the nature of the metaheuristics used in the automatic search stage of CNN architectures which was performed using the Boltzmann Univariate Marginal Distribution algorithm (BUMDA) chosen by statistical comparison between four metaheuristics to explore the search space, whose computational complexity is O(229). Moreover, the proposed method is compared with multiple state-of-the-art methods on five databases, testing its efficiency in terms of accuracy and F1-score. In the experimental results, the proposed method achieved an F1-score of 97.2%, 98.73%, 97.23%, 98.36%, and 98.7% in its best evaluation, better results than the literature. Finally, the computational time of the proposed method for the test set was approximate to 0.6 s, 1 s, 0.7 s, 0.5 s, and 0.1 s, respectively.",

        "authors": "Ramos-Frutos, J, Oliva, D, Campos-Pe\u00f1a, D",
        "description": "Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) have gained substantial attention in optimization due to their ability to efficiently explore complex search spaces by modeling promising regions through probability distributions. However, their effectiveness can be further enhanced by integrating complementary optimization techniques. This paper proposes a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of an EDA with the powerful optimization capabilities of Simulated Annealing (SA) in synergy with a mutation operator and the initialization using the Latin Hypercube. It is called directed EDA (R-EDA). The hybrid algorithm permits abetter exploration since the early optimization stages. It weighs the diversity-preserving mechanisms of EDAs while incorporating the robust exploitation abilities of SA in combination with a mutation operator. The synergy of the elements introduced in the R-EDA permits an algorithm that can provide accurate solutions to complex and high- dimensional problems. The R-EDA is tested over a series of experiments on 36 benchmark optimization problems in 30, 50, and 100 dimensions with unimodal, multimodal, composite, and shifted optimization landscapes. Additionally, a comparison of the application of modeling solar cells using three different approaches is presented. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of R-EDA in achieving superior optimization performance compared with well-known state-of-the-art algorithms over the benchmark function and solar cells modeling application. Furthermore, the impact of key algorithmic parameters is analyzed, providing insights into the synergistic effects of the hybridization process.",
