        "description": "Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) are preferred in solving multi-objective optimization problems due to their considerable performance giving decision-maker a set of not only convergent but diversified promising solutions. However, the scalability of MOEAs deteriorates in addressing many objective optimization problems which involve more than three conflicting objectives. The principal reason is largely due to the deficiency of the existing genetic operators which cannot generate promising offspring from parents chosen by the Pareto-dominance rule in these MOEAs. Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) generate offspring with a probabilistic model built from the statistics extracting upon existing solutions to expectedly alleviate the weakness arisen in genetic operators. In this paper, a reference line-based EDA is proposed for effectively solving many-objective optimization problems. Specifically, the estimation model is built based on the reference lines in the decision space to sample solutions with favorable proximity. Then solutions with considerable diversity in Pareto-optimal front are selected. These two phases collectively promote the needed convergence and diversity for the proposed algorithm. To evaluate the performance, extensive experiments are performed against four state-of-the-art many objective evolutionary algorithms and two EDAs over DTLZ and WFG test suites with 5-, 8-, 10-, and 15-objective. Experimental results quantified by the selected performance metrics indicate that the proposed algorithm shows significant competitiveness in tackling many-objective optimization problems.

When indeterminacies come into play, the leveled baseline schedule obtained by solving deterministic resource leveling problem can hardly be executed as planned and this schedule may even become infeasible. In this paper, on the basis of uncertainty theory, we consider an uncertain resource leveling problem in which activity durations are estimated by experts. In order to deal with these estimations, three uncertainty-theory-based project scheduling models are proposed and we utilize revised estimation of distribution algorithms to search quasi-optimal schedules. Numerical experiments are also provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithms.",

        "description": "Metaheuristics that explore the decision variables space to construct probabilistic modeling from promising solutions, like estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), are becoming very popular in the context of Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs). The probabilistic model used in EDAs captures certain statistics of problem variables and their interdependencies. Moreover, the incorporation of local search methods tends to achieve synergy of MOEAs' operators and local heuristics aiming to improve the performance. In this work, we aim to scrutinize the probabilistic graphic model (PGM) presented in Hybrid Multi-objective Bayesian Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (HMOBEDA), which is based on a Bayesian network. Different from traditional EDA-based approaches, the PGM of HMOBEDA provides the joint probability of decision variables, objectives, and configuration parameters of an embedded local search. HMOBEDA has shown to be very competitive on instances of Multi-Objective Knapsack Problem (MOKP), outperforming state-of-the-art approaches. Two variants of HMOBEDA are proposed in this paper using different sample methods. We aim to compare the learnt structure in terms of the probabilistic Pareto Front approximation produced at the end of evolution. Results on instances of MOKP with 2 to 8 objectives show that both proposed variants outperform the original approach, providing not only the best values for hypervolume and inverted generational distance indicators, but also a higher diversity in the solution set.",

Recently, distance-based exponential models, such as Mallows Model (MM) and Generalized Mallows Model (GMM), have demonstrated their validity in the context of EDAs to deal with permutation-based optimization problems. The aim of this paper is two-fold. First, we introduce a novel general multi-objective decomposition-based EDA using Kernels of Mallows models (MEDA/D-MK framework) for solving multi-objective permutation-based optimization problems. Second, in order to demonstrate the validity of the MEDA/D-MK, we have applied it to solve the multi-objective permutation flowshop scheduling problem (MoPFSP) minimizing the total flow time and the makespan. The permutation flowshop scheduling problem is one of the most studied problems of this kind due to its fields of application and algorithmic challenge. The results of our experiments show that MEDA/D-MK outperforms an improved MOEA/D variant specific tailored for minimizing makespan and total flowtime. Furthermore, our approach achieves competitive results compared to the best-known approximated Pareto fronts reported in the literature for the benchmark considered. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Compared to traditional techniques, this method is comprehensively improved in the stage of both sampling and state evaluation. In the sampling stage, the population-based incremental learning algorithm is presented, where the probability vector is updated based on the distribution characteristics of excellent samples in population of previous generations. Meanwhile, setting a limit to the probabilities of elements in normal state and mutation strategy are introduced, which improves the excellent characteristics of the population. In the state evaluation stage, the state search and match process is speed up by utilising the intelligent storage technology based on the double across linked list. It avoids calling the optimal power flow for the same state repeatedly. Finally, the proposed method is tested in IEEE RTS 79. As the result shows, compared with other methods ever used in reliability evaluation, this method is not only more efficient in computation but also more accurate. Thus, the proposed method is proved to be reliable and effective.",

With the increase of alternative services, Quality of Service (QoS) becomes an important indicator of obtaining optimal composite services. Due to the dynamic nature of the service environment, a composite service may not guarantee to deliver an overall optimal QoS. Re-optimization approaches have been developed to handle a dynamic environment. However, these approaches do not consider the diversity of alternative solutions, which may lead to better solutions. In this work, we introduce an adaptive approach, called estimation of distribution algorithm based on Restricted Boltzmann Machine (rEDA). rEDA effectively maintains the diversity of alternative solutions, by leveraging the inference ability of Restricted Boltzmann Machine to capture the potential solutions. It also provides a predictive guidance for the exploration of solution space, by considering the degree of how well a service contributes to the global QoS. The experimental evaluation shows that rEDA has a significant improvement on effectiveness and efficiency over existing approaches.",

We study three mixtures of hydrocarbons and one mixture of polar compounds. The results show that the BUMDA algorithm leads continuously to obtain good values of the fitness function. The analysis carried out showed that the influence of the feed composition was larger in the energy consumption than in the TAC at each case study. In addition, the best compromise between energy consumption and the total annual cost was obtained in mixtures with a feed composition of 0.75/0.25 for most case studies. These HIDiC configurations showed energy savings between 85 and 87%. Thus, similar reductions in the energy consumption, carbon dioxide emissions and cooling water were obtained. On the other hand, the TAC of the best HIDiC designs varies from HIDiC designs with a reduction of 27% to HIDiC schemes with a TAC 2% larger than the corresponding TAC of the traditional configurations.

To solve the uncertain SCCSP with interval processing times, an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) combined with robust optimization (RO) is proposed. First, a novel EDA with multiple probabilistic models and adaptive sampling policy is developed to solve the MAP. Second, the RO approach with ellipsoidal sets is embedded in the EDA and used to solve the TTP. To verify the proposed algorithm, a number of instances are generated from real-world industrial data.

Then these two algorithms are equipped with three distinctive techniques: 1) a dynamic cluster sizing strategy; 2) an alternative utilization of Gaussian and Cauchy distributions to generate offspring; and 3) an adaptive local search. The dynamic cluster sizing affords a potential balance between exploration and exploitation and reduces the sensitivity to the cluster size in the niching methods. Taking advantages of Gaussian and Cauchy distributions, we generate the offspring at the niche level through alternatively using these two distributions. Such utilization can also potentially offer a balance between exploration and exploitation. Further, solution accuracy is enhanced through a new local search scheme probabilistically conducted around seeds of niches with probabilities determined self-adaptively according to fitness values of these seeds. Extensive experiments conducted on 20 benchmark multimodal problems confirm that both algorithms can achieve competitive performance compared with several state-of-the-art multimodal algorithms, which is supported by nonparametric tests.

In contrast, other evolution-inspired algorithms (such as rHN-G and MACRO) use selection differently - within the process that generates samples from the model. It has been hypothesised that this 'constructive selection' process can facilitate optimisation that other EDAs cannot but this has not been previously shown. Here we investigate these distinctions using constraint optimisation problems with a very simple modular structure. We find that a simple constructive selection method (rHN-g) can solve these problems in time polynomial in the problem size whereas other methods, such as BOA, require exponential time. We confirm that this result arises not from any difficulty in acquiring an accurate model but because of how samples are generated given the model. This suggests that by using constructive selection other EDAs could exploit the models they learn more efficiently to solve otherwise unsolvable problems.",

        "description": "Decision trees are one of the most widely employed classification models, mainly due to their capability of being properly interpreted and understood by the domain specialist. However, decision-tree induction algorithms have limitations due to the typical recursive top-down greedy search they implement. Such local search may often lead to quality loss while the partitioning process occurs, generating statistically insignificant rules. In order to avoid the typical greedy strategy and to prevent convergence to local optima, we present a novel Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) for decision-tree induction, namely Ardennes. For evaluating the proposed approach, we present results of an empirical analysis in 10 real-world classification datasets. We compare Ardennes with both a well-known traditional greedy algorithm for decision-tree induction and also with a more recent global population-based approach. Results show the feasibility of using EDAs as a means to avoid the previously-described problems. We report gains when using Ardennes in terms of accuracy and - equally important - tree comprehensibility.",

A covariance sharing strategy is designed in AMEDA to reduce the complexity of building MGMs, and an adaptive update strategy of the probability that controls the contributions of the two types of MGMs is developed to dynamically balance exploration and exploitation. AMEDA is compared with four representative MOEAs on a number of test instances with complex Pareto fronts and variable linkages.

In each generation, the joint probability distribution of the selected solutions is estimated using a Gaussian Mixture model. Then, learning the graphical model of dependencies among random variables and sampling are done separately for each Gaussian component. In the learning step, using the selected solutions of each Gaussian mixture component, the structure of a Markov network is learned. This network is decomposed to maximal cliques and a clique graph. Then, complete Bayesian network structures are learned for these subgraphs using an optimization algorithm. The proposed optimization problem is a 0-1 constrained quadratic programming which finds the best permutation of variables.

        "description": "Estimation-of-Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) have been applied with quite some success when solving real-valued optimization problems, especially in the case of Black Box Optimization (BBO). Generally, the performance of an EDA depends on the match between its driving probability distribution and the landscape of the problem being solved. Because most well-known EDAs, including CMA-ES, NES, and AMaLGaM, use a uni-modal search distribution, they have a high risk of getting trapped in local optima when a problem is multi-modal with a (moderate) number of relatively comparable modes. This risk could potentially be mitigated using niching methods that define multiple regions of interest where separate search distributions govern sub-populations. However, a key question is how to determine a suitable number of niches, especially in BBO. In this paper, we present a novel, adaptive niching approach that determines the niches through hierarchical clustering based on the correlation between the probability densities and fitness values of solutions. We test the performance of a combination of this niching approach with AMaLGaM on both new and well-known niching benchmark problems and find that the new approach properly identifies multiple landscape modes, leading to much better performance on multi-modal problems than with a non-niched, uni-modal EDA.y",

Thus, they do not allow for a straightforward application of traditional optimization techniques. In these settings, randomized search heuristics such as evolutionary algorithms are a popular choice because they are often assumed to exhibit some kind of resistance to noise. Empirical evidence suggests that some algorithms, such as estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) are robust against a scaling of the noise intensity, even without resorting to explicit noise-handling techniques such as resampling. In this paper, we want to support such claims with mathematical rigor. We introduce the concept of graceful scaling in which the run time of an algorithm scales polynomially with noise intensity. We study a monotone fitness function over binary strings with additive noise taken from a Gaussian distribution. We show that myopic heuristics cannot efficiently optimize the function under arbitrarily intense noise without any explicit noise-handling. Furthermore, we prove that using a population does not help. Finally, we show that a simple EDA called the compact genetic algorithm can overcome the short-sightedness of mutation-only heuristics to scale gracefully with noise. We conjecture that recombinative genetic algorithms also have this property.",

        "description": "A multi-objective optimization model for the problem of gesture segmentation is formulated, and a method of solving the model based on a two-phase estimation of distribution algorithm is presented. When building the model, the positions of a series of pixels are taken as the decision variable, and the differences between the colors of pixels and those of a hand are taken as objective functions. A method of gesture segmentation based on a two-phase estimation of distribution algorithm is proposed according to the correlation among the positions of pixels. The method divides the solution of the problem based on evolutionary optimization into two phases, and uses different estimation of distribution algorithms in different phases. In the first phase, the probability model of candidates is formulated by a number of intervals given the fact that the positions of hand pixels distribute in several intervals. In the second phase, the probability model of candidates is built through a series of segments since the positions of hand pixels further distribute around curves. A series of pixels constituting a hand region are obtained based on sampling by the above probability models. The proposed method is applied to 2515 problems of gesture segmentation, and is compared with the existing methods. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

        "description": "This paper proposes a distance-based two-stage ecological (eco-) driving scheme by using estimation of distribution algorithms (EDA) and model-based prediction of traffic conditions. Before departure, the optimal speed profile for an entire route is generated by an EDA in combination with speedup approaches for a faster computing time, which can optimize the complex cost function of ecodriving without simplification within a reasonably short computing time. This optimization is performed in a distance domain for localizing changes in the optimal speed profile due to traffic conditions while driving. After departure, by taking the optimal speed profile and actual traffic conditions into consideration, the speed profile for a short term-to only the next location-is adapted. In order to reliably react to actual traffic conditions, additional points are interpolated into the long-term distance step and fine control of speeds at the additional points is established, which is based on a predictive model for estimating the spacing to the preceding vehicle. The proposed ecodriving system is evaluated in two types of route conditions, and its results are compared with the optimization result by the quadratic programming method. This comparison shows that an EDA can generate a speed profile with better optimization results in terms of fuel efficiency and driving time within a shorter computing time.",

        "description": "Multi-objective Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (MOEDAS) have been successfully applied to solve Multi-objective Optimization Problems (MOPs) since they are able to model dependencies between variables of the problem and then sample new solutions to guide the search to promising areas. A state-of-the-art optimizer for single-objective continuous functions that also uses probabilistic modeling is the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES). Different variants of CMA-ES have been proposed for MOPs however most of them are based on Pareto dominance as the main selection criterion. Recently, a new multi-objective CMA-ES called MOEA/D-CMA was proposed combining the strengths of CMA-ES with those of the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D). Nowadays, however, researchers on MOEAs agree that combining Pareto and decomposition can be beneficial for the search on MOPs. As a result, a new MOEA has been proposed, called MOEA/DD. This algorithm modifies the MOEA/D by including a new Pareto dominance update mechanism that brings more diversity into the search. In this study, we extend the MOEA/D-CMA by replacing its update mechanism by the one of MOEA/DD. The hypothesis is that this update mechanism will improve the performance of MOEA/D-CMA as it improved MOEA/D. MOEA/D-CMA and MOEA/DD-CMA are implemented and evaluated through an experimental study. The experimental study involves two well-known families of benchmark problems whose objective numbers scale from two to fifteen. Then, an extensive statistical analysis of the results is made to extract sound, statistically supported conclusions about the performance of the algorithms as the number of objectives scales.",

In this context the related literature has extensively shown that dynamic time warping is the similarity measure of choice when univariate time series are considered. However, possible statistical coupling among different dimensions make the generalization of this metric to the multivariate case all but obvious. This has ignited the interest of the community in new distance definitions capable of capturing such inter-dimension dependences. In this paper we propose a simple dynamic time warping based distance that finds the best weighted combination between the dependent - where multivariate time series are treated as whole - and independent approaches - where multivariate time series are just a collection of unrelated univariate time series - of the time series to be classified. A benchmark of four heuristic wrappers, namely, simulated annealing, particle swarm optimization, estimation of distribution algorithms and genetic algorithms are used to evolve the set of weighting coefficients towards maximizing the cross-validated predictive score of the classifiers. In this context one of the most recurring classifiers is nearest neighbor. This classifier is couple with a distance that as afore mentioned, in most cases, have been dynamic time warping. The performance of the proposed approach is validated over datasets widely utilized in the related literature, from which it is concluded that the obtained performance gains can be enlarged by properly decoupling the influence of each dimension in the definition of the dependent dynamic time warping distance.",

Integrated with clustering strategies for crowding and speciation, two versions of this algorithm are developed, which operate at the niche level. Then these two algorithms are equipped with three distinctive techniques: 1) a dynamic cluster sizing strategy; 2) an alternative utilization of Gaussian and Cauchy distributions to generate offspring; and 3) an adaptive local search. The dynamic cluster sizing affords a potential balance between exploration and exploitation and reduces the sensitivity to the cluster size in the niching methods. Taking advantages of Gaussian and Cauchy distributions, we generate the offspring at the niche level through alternatively using these two distributions. Such utilization can also potentially offer a balance between exploration and exploitation. Further, solution accuracy is enhanced through a new local search scheme probabilistically conducted around seeds of niches with probabilities determined self-adaptively according to fitness values of these seeds. Extensive experiments conducted on 20 benchmark multimodal problems confirm that both algorithms can achieve competitive performance compared with several state-of-the-art multimodal algorithms, which is supported by nonparametric tests.

However, bivariate models previously used in similar discrete EDAs were only able to exploit an O(d) subset of all the O(d 2) bivariate variable dependencies between d variables. We introduce, and utilize in DICE, a model based on dichotomised multivariate Gaussian distributions. These models are able to capture and make use of all O(d 2) bivariate variable interactions in binary and multary search spaces. This paper tests the performances of these new EDA models and algorithms on a suite of challenging combinatorial optimization problems, and compares their performances to previously used discrete-space bivariate EDA models.

        "description": "Model-building optimisation methods aim to learn the structure underlying a problem and exploit this to direct the exploration of solutions. This generally interleaves two processes: Generating samples (from the model), and updating the model (using selected samples). In most estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), e.g. BOA, selection is used only in the laSer, to determine which samples are retained for updating the model. In contrast, other evolution-inspired algorithms (such as rHN-G and MACRO) use selection differently - within the process that generates samples from the model. It has been hypothesised that this 'constructive selection' process can facilitate optimisation that other EDAs cannot but this has not been previously shown. Here we investigate these distinctions using constraint optimisation problems with a very simple modular structure. We find that a simple constructive selection method (rHN-g) can solve these problems in time polynomial in the problem size whereas other methods, such as BOA, require exponential time. We confirm that this result arises not from any difficulty in acquiring an accurate model but because of how samples are generated given the model. This suggests that by using constructive selection other EDAs could exploit the models they learn more efficiently to solve otherwise unsolvable problems.",

If mu >= c'root n logn for a constant c' > 0 and lambda = (1 + Theta(1))mu, the behavior of the algorithm changes and the bound on the expected runtime becomes O(mu root n), which typically even holds if the borders on the marginal probabilities are omitted.|The results supplement the recently derived lower bound Omega(mu(root n+ n logn) by Krejca and WiS (FOGA 2017) and turn out as tight for the two very different values mu = c logn and mu = c'root n logn. They also improve the previously best known upper bound O(n logn log logn) by Dang and Lehre (GECCO 2015).",

It will be shown that, after a simple repair operation, inferior solutions could be surprisingly useful in adjusting the covariance matrix of Gaussian model, then a better search direction and a more proper search scale can be obtained.

A clustering analysis approach is utilized in AMEDA to discover the distribution structure of the population. Based on the distribution information, with a certain probability, a local or a global multivariate Gaussian model (MGM) is built for each solution to sample a new solution. A covariance sharing strategy is designed in AMEDA to reduce the complexity of building MGMs, and an adaptive update strategy of the probability that controls the contributions of the two types of MGMs is developed to dynamically balance exploration and exploitation. AMEDA is compared with four representative MOEAs on a number of test instances with complex Pareto fronts and variable linkages. Experimental results suggest that AMEDA outperforms the comparison algorithms on dealing with the test instances. The effectiveness of the clustering-based multivariate Gaussian sampling strategy and the adaptive probability update strategy is also experimentally verified.",

The goal is to propose a method that avoids complex approximations of learning a probabilistic graphical model and considers multivariate dependencies between continuous random variables. A parallel model of some subgraphs with a smaller number of variables is learned as the probabilistic graphical model. In each generation, the joint probability distribution of the selected solutions is estimated using a Gaussian Mixture model. Then, learning the graphical model of dependencies among random variables and sampling are done separately for each Gaussian component. In the learning step, using the selected solutions of each Gaussian mixture component, the structure of a Markov network is learned. This network is decomposed to maximal cliques and a clique graph. Then, complete Bayesian network structures are learned for these subgraphs using an optimization algorithm. The proposed optimization problem is a 0-1 constrained quadratic programming which finds the best permutation of variables. Then, sampling is done from each Bayesian network of each Gaussian component.

        "description": "Estimation-of-Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) have been applied with quite some success when solving real-valued optimization problems, especially in the case of Black Box Optimization (BBO). Generally, the performance of an EDA depends on the match between its driving probability distribution and the landscape of the problem being solved. Because most well-known EDAs, including CMA-ES, NES, and AMaLGaM, use a uni-modal search distribution, they have a high risk of getting trapped in local optima when a problem is multi-modal with a (moderate) number of relatively comparable modes. This risk could potentially be mitigated using niching methods that define multiple regions of interest where separate search distributions govern sub-populations. However, a key question is how to determine a suitable number of niches, especially in BBO. In this paper, we present a novel, adaptive niching approach that determines the niches through hierarchical clustering based on the correlation between the probability densities and fitness values of solutions. We test the performance of a combination of this niching approach with AMaLGaM on both new and well-known niching benchmark problems and find that the new approach properly identifies multiple landscape modes, leading to much better performance on multi-modal problems than with a non-niched, uni-modal EDA.y",

        "description": "Practical optimization problems frequently include uncertainty about the quality measure, for example, due to noisy evaluations. Thus, they do not allow for a straightforward application of traditional optimization techniques. In these settings, randomized search heuristics such as evolutionary algorithms are a popular choice because they are often assumed to exhibit some kind of resistance to noise. Empirical evidence suggests that some algorithms, such as estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) are robust against a scaling of the noise intensity, even without resorting to explicit noise-handling techniques such as resampling. In this paper, we want to support such claims with mathematical rigor. We introduce the concept of graceful scaling in which the run time of an algorithm scales polynomially with noise intensity. We study a monotone fitness function over binary strings with additive noise taken from a Gaussian distribution. We show that myopic heuristics cannot efficiently optimize the function under arbitrarily intense noise without any explicit noise-handling. Furthermore, we prove that using a population does not help. Finally, we show that a simple EDA called the compact genetic algorithm can overcome the short-sightedness of mutation-only heuristics to scale gracefully with noise. We conjecture that recombinative genetic algorithms also have this property.",

When building the model, the positions of a series of pixels are taken as the decision variable, and the differences between the colors of pixels and those of a hand are taken as objective functions. A method of gesture segmentation based on a two-phase estimation of distribution algorithm is proposed according to the correlation among the positions of pixels. The method divides the solution of the problem based on evolutionary optimization into two phases, and uses different estimation of distribution algorithms in different phases. In the first phase, the probability model of candidates is formulated by a number of intervals given the fact that the positions of hand pixels distribute in several intervals. In the second phase, the probability model of candidates is built through a series of segments since the positions of hand pixels further distribute around curves. A series of pixels constituting a hand region are obtained based on sampling by the above probability models. The proposed method is applied to 2515 problems of gesture segmentation, and is compared with the existing methods. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Before departure, the optimal speed profile for an entire route is generated by an EDA in combination with speedup approaches for a faster computing time, which can optimize the complex cost function of ecodriving without simplification within a reasonably short computing time. This optimization is performed in a distance domain for localizing changes in the optimal speed profile due to traffic conditions while driving. After departure, by taking the optimal speed profile and actual traffic conditions into consideration, the speed profile for a short term-to only the next location-is adapted. In order to reliably react to actual traffic conditions, additional points are interpolated into the long-term distance step and fine control of speeds at the additional points is established, which is based on a predictive model for estimating the spacing to the preceding vehicle. The proposed ecodriving system is evaluated in two types of route conditions, and its results are compared with the optimization result by the quadratic programming method. This comparison shows that an EDA can generate a speed profile with better optimization results in terms of fuel efficiency and driving time within a shorter computing time.",

A state-of-the-art optimizer for single-objective continuous functions that also uses probabilistic modeling is the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES). Different variants of CMA-ES have been proposed for MOPs however most of them are based on Pareto dominance as the main selection criterion. Recently, a new multi-objective CMA-ES called MOEA/D-CMA was proposed combining the strengths of CMA-ES with those of the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D). Nowadays, however, researchers on MOEAs agree that combining Pareto and decomposition can be beneficial for the search on MOPs. As a result, a new MOEA has been proposed, called MOEA/DD. This algorithm modifies the MOEA/D by including a new Pareto dominance update mechanism that brings more diversity into the search. In this study, we extend the MOEA/D-CMA by replacing its update mechanism by the one of MOEA/DD. The hypothesis is that this update mechanism will improve the performance of MOEA/D-CMA as it improved MOEA/D. MOEA/D-CMA and MOEA/DD-CMA are implemented and evaluated through an experimental study. The experimental study involves two well-known families of benchmark problems whose objective numbers scale from two to fifteen.

However, possible statistical coupling among different dimensions make the generalization of this metric to the multivariate case all but obvious. This has ignited the interest of the community in new distance definitions capable of capturing such inter-dimension dependences. In this paper we propose a simple dynamic time warping based distance that finds the best weighted combination between the dependent - where multivariate time series are treated as whole - and independent approaches - where multivariate time series are just a collection of unrelated univariate time series - of the time series to be classified. A benchmark of four heuristic wrappers, namely, simulated annealing, particle swarm optimization, estimation of distribution algorithms and genetic algorithms are used to evolve the set of weighting coefficients towards maximizing the cross-validated predictive score of the classifiers. In this context one of the most recurring classifiers is nearest neighbor. This classifier is couple with a distance that as afore mentioned, in most cases, have been dynamic time warping. The performance of the proposed approach is validated over datasets widely utilized in the related literature, from which it is concluded that the obtained performance gains can be enlarged by properly decoupling the influence of each dimension in the definition of the dependent dynamic time warping distance.",

The dynamic cluster sizing affords a potential balance between exploration and exploitation and reduces the sensitivity to the cluster size in the niching methods. Taking advantages of Gaussian and Cauchy distributions, we generate the offspring at the niche level through alternatively using these two distributions. Such utilization can also potentially offer a balance between exploration and exploitation. Further, solution accuracy is enhanced through a new local search scheme probabilistically conducted around seeds of niches with probabilities determined self-adaptively according to fitness values of these seeds. Extensive experiments conducted on 20 benchmark multimodal problems confirm that both algorithms can achieve competitive performance compared with several state-of-the-art multimodal algorithms, which is supported by nonparametric tests. Especially, the proposed algorithms are very promising for complex problems with many local optima.",

        "description": "Hyper-parameter tuning for support vector machines has been widely studied in the past decade. A variety of metaheuristics, such as Genetic Algorithms and Particle Swarm Optimization have been considered to accomplish this task. Notably, exhaustive strategies such as Grid Search or Random Search continue to be implemented for hyper-parameter tuning and have recently shown results comparable to sophisticated metaheuristics. The main reason for the success of exhaustive techniques is due to the fact that only two or three parameters need to be adjusted when working with support vector machines. In this chapter, we analyze two Estimation Distribution Algorithms, the Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm and the Boltzmann Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm, to verify if these algorithms preserve the effectiveness of Random Search and at the same time make more efficient the process of finding the optimal hyper-parameters without increasing the complexity of Random Search.",

The method computes a virtual parabola using three random boundary pixels to calculate the constant values of the generic parabola equation. The resulting parabola is evaluated by matching it with the parabolic shape in the input image by using the Hadamard product as fitness function. This proposed method is evaluated in terms of computational time and compared with two implementations of the generalized Hough transform and RANSAC method for parabola detection. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the comparative methods in terms of execution time about 93.61% on synthetic images and 89% on retinal fundus and human plantar arch images.

The proposed algorithms, which we label DICE (Discrete Correlated Estimation of distribution algorithms) are based, like previous bivariate EDAs such as MIMIC and BMDA, on bivariate marginal distribution models. However, bivariate models previously used in similar discrete EDAs were only able to exploit an O(d) subset of all the O(d 2) bivariate variable dependencies between d variables. We introduce, and utilize in DICE, a model based on dichotomised multivariate Gaussian distributions. These models are able to capture and make use of all O(d 2) bivariate variable interactions in binary and multary search spaces. This paper tests the performances of these new EDA models and algorithms on a suite of challenging combinatorial optimization problems, and compares their performances to previously used discrete-space bivariate EDA models. EDAs utilizing these new dichotomised Gaussian (DG) models exhibit significantly superior optimization performances, with the performance gap becoming more marked with increasing dimensionality.",

        "description": "Model-building optimisation methods aim to learn the structure underlying a problem and exploit this to direct the exploration of solutions. This generally interleaves two processes: Generating samples (from the model), and updating the model (using selected samples). In most estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), e.g. BOA, selection is used only in the laSer, to determine which samples are retained for updating the model. In contrast, other evolution-inspired algorithms (such as rHN-G and MACRO) use selection differently - within the process that generates samples from the model. It has been hypothesised that this 'constructive selection' process can facilitate optimisation that other EDAs cannot but this has not been previously shown. Here we investigate these distinctions using constraint optimisation problems with a very simple modular structure. We find that a simple constructive selection method (rHN-g) can solve these problems in time polynomial in the problem size whereas other methods, such as BOA, require exponential time. We confirm that this result arises not from any difficulty in acquiring an accurate model but because of how samples are generated given the model. This suggests that by using constructive selection other EDAs could exploit the models they learn more efficiently to solve otherwise unsolvable problems.",

Such local search may often lead to quality loss while the partitioning process occurs, generating statistically insignificant rules. In order to avoid the typical greedy strategy and to prevent convergence to local optima, we present a novel Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) for decision-tree induction, namely Ardennes. For evaluating the proposed approach, we present results of an empirical analysis in 10 real-world classification datasets. We compare Ardennes with both a well-known traditional greedy algorithm for decision-tree induction and also with a more recent global population-based approach. Results show the feasibility of using EDAs as a means to avoid the previously-described problems.

A covariance sharing strategy is designed in AMEDA to reduce the complexity of building MGMs, and an adaptive update strategy of the probability that controls the contributions of the two types of MGMs is developed to dynamically balance exploration and exploitation. AMEDA is compared with four representative MOEAs on a number of test instances with complex Pareto fronts and variable linkages.

        "description": "In this paper, a new estimation of distribution algorithm is introduced. The goal is to propose a method that avoids complex approximations of learning a probabilistic graphical model and considers multivariate dependencies between continuous random variables. A parallel model of some subgraphs with a smaller number of variables is learned as the probabilistic graphical model. In each generation, the joint probability distribution of the selected solutions is estimated using a Gaussian Mixture model. Then, learning the graphical model of dependencies among random variables and sampling are done separately for each Gaussian component. In the learning step, using the selected solutions of each Gaussian mixture component, the structure of a Markov network is learned. This network is decomposed to maximal cliques and a clique graph. Then, complete Bayesian network structures are learned for these subgraphs using an optimization algorithm. The proposed optimization problem is a 0-1 constrained quadratic programming which finds the best permutation of variables. Then, sampling is done from each Bayesian network of each Gaussian component.

        "description": "Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) have become a reliable alternative to solve a broad range of single and multi-objective optimization problems. Recently, distance-based exponential models, such as Mallows Model (MM) and Generalized Mallows Model (GMM), have demonstrated their validity in the context of EDAs to deal with permutation-based optimization problems. The aim of this paper is two-fold. First, we introduce a novel general multi-objective decomposition-based EDA using Kernels of Mallows models (MEDA/D-MK framework) for solving multi-objective permutation-based optimization problems. Second, in order to demonstrate the validity of the MEDA/D-MK, we have applied it to solve the multi-objective permutation flowshop scheduling problem (MoPFSP) minimizing the total flow time and the makespan. The permutation flowshop scheduling problem is one of the most studied problems of this kind due to its fields of application and algorithmic challenge. The results of our experiments show that MEDA/D-MK outperforms an improved MOEA/D variant specific tailored for minimizing makespan and total flowtime. Furthermore, our approach achieves competitive results compared to the best-known approximated Pareto fronts reported in the literature for the benchmark considered. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

        "description": "Estimation-of-Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) have been applied with quite some success when solving real-valued optimization problems, especially in the case of Black Box Optimization (BBO). Generally, the performance of an EDA depends on the match between its driving probability distribution and the landscape of the problem being solved. Because most well-known EDAs, including CMA-ES, NES, and AMaLGaM, use a uni-modal search distribution, they have a high risk of getting trapped in local optima when a problem is multi-modal with a (moderate) number of relatively comparable modes. This risk could potentially be mitigated using niching methods that define multiple regions of interest where separate search distributions govern sub-populations. However, a key question is how to determine a suitable number of niches, especially in BBO. In this paper, we present a novel, adaptive niching approach that determines the niches through hierarchical clustering based on the correlation between the probability densities and fitness values of solutions. We test the performance of a combination of this niching approach with AMaLGaM on both new and well-known niching benchmark problems and find that the new approach properly identifies multiple landscape modes, leading to much better performance on multi-modal problems than with a non-niched, uni-modal EDA.y",

        "description": "Practical optimization problems frequently include uncertainty about the quality measure, for example, due to noisy evaluations. Thus, they do not allow for a straightforward application of traditional optimization techniques. In these settings, randomized search heuristics such as evolutionary algorithms are a popular choice because they are often assumed to exhibit some kind of resistance to noise. Empirical evidence suggests that some algorithms, such as estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) are robust against a scaling of the noise intensity, even without resorting to explicit noise-handling techniques such as resampling. In this paper, we want to support such claims with mathematical rigor. We introduce the concept of graceful scaling in which the run time of an algorithm scales polynomially with noise intensity. We study a monotone fitness function over binary strings with additive noise taken from a Gaussian distribution. We show that myopic heuristics cannot efficiently optimize the function under arbitrarily intense noise without any explicit noise-handling. Furthermore, we prove that using a population does not help. Finally, we show that a simple EDA called the compact genetic algorithm can overcome the short-sightedness of mutation-only heuristics to scale gracefully with noise. We conjecture that recombinative genetic algorithms also have this property.",

        "description": "A multi-objective optimization model for the problem of gesture segmentation is formulated, and a method of solving the model based on a two-phase estimation of distribution algorithm is presented. When building the model, the positions of a series of pixels are taken as the decision variable, and the differences between the colors of pixels and those of a hand are taken as objective functions. A method of gesture segmentation based on a two-phase estimation of distribution algorithm is proposed according to the correlation among the positions of pixels. The method divides the solution of the problem based on evolutionary optimization into two phases, and uses different estimation of distribution algorithms in different phases. In the first phase, the probability model of candidates is formulated by a number of intervals given the fact that the positions of hand pixels distribute in several intervals. In the second phase, the probability model of candidates is built through a series of segments since the positions of hand pixels further distribute around curves. A series of pixels constituting a hand region are obtained based on sampling by the above probability models. The proposed method is applied to 2515 problems of gesture segmentation, and is compared with the existing methods. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

        "description": "This paper proposes a distance-based two-stage ecological (eco-) driving scheme by using estimation of distribution algorithms (EDA) and model-based prediction of traffic conditions. Before departure, the optimal speed profile for an entire route is generated by an EDA in combination with speedup approaches for a faster computing time, which can optimize the complex cost function of ecodriving without simplification within a reasonably short computing time. This optimization is performed in a distance domain for localizing changes in the optimal speed profile due to traffic conditions while driving. After departure, by taking the optimal speed profile and actual traffic conditions into consideration, the speed profile for a short term-to only the next location-is adapted. In order to reliably react to actual traffic conditions, additional points are interpolated into the long-term distance step and fine control of speeds at the additional points is established, which is based on a predictive model for estimating the spacing to the preceding vehicle. The proposed ecodriving system is evaluated in two types of route conditions, and its results are compared with the optimization result by the quadratic programming method. This comparison shows that an EDA can generate a speed profile with better optimization results in terms of fuel efficiency and driving time within a shorter computing time.",

A state-of-the-art optimizer for single-objective continuous functions that also uses probabilistic modeling is the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES). Different variants of CMA-ES have been proposed for MOPs however most of them are based on Pareto dominance as the main selection criterion. Recently, a new multi-objective CMA-ES called MOEA/D-CMA was proposed combining the strengths of CMA-ES with those of the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D). Nowadays, however, researchers on MOEAs agree that combining Pareto and decomposition can be beneficial for the search on MOPs. As a result, a new MOEA has been proposed, called MOEA/DD. This algorithm modifies the MOEA/D by including a new Pareto dominance update mechanism that brings more diversity into the search. In this study, we extend the MOEA/D-CMA by replacing its update mechanism by the one of MOEA/DD. The hypothesis is that this update mechanism will improve the performance of MOEA/D-CMA as it improved MOEA/D. MOEA/D-CMA and MOEA/DD-CMA are implemented and evaluated through an experimental study. The experimental study involves two well-known families of benchmark problems whose objective numbers scale from two to fifteen. Then, an extensive statistical analysis of the results is made to extract sound, statistically supported conclusions about the performance of the algorithms as the number of objectives scales.",

        "description": "The applicability of time series data mining in many different fields has motivated the scientific community to focus on the development of new methods towards improving the performance of the classifiers over this particular class of data. In this context the related literature has extensively shown that dynamic time warping is the similarity measure of choice when univariate time series are considered. However, possible statistical coupling among different dimensions make the generalization of this metric to the multivariate case all but obvious. This has ignited the interest of the community in new distance definitions capable of capturing such inter-dimension dependences. In this paper we propose a simple dynamic time warping based distance that finds the best weighted combination between the dependent - where multivariate time series are treated as whole - and independent approaches - where multivariate time series are just a collection of unrelated univariate time series - of the time series to be classified. A benchmark of four heuristic wrappers, namely, simulated annealing, particle swarm optimization, estimation of distribution algorithms and genetic algorithms are used to evolve the set of weighting coefficients towards maximizing the cross-validated predictive score of the classifiers. In this context one of the most recurring classifiers is nearest neighbor. This classifier is couple with a distance that as afore mentioned, in most cases, have been dynamic time warping. The performance of the proposed approach is validated over datasets widely utilized in the related literature, from which it is concluded that the obtained performance gains can be enlarged by properly decoupling the influence of each dimension in the definition of the dependent dynamic time warping distance.",

Integrated with clustering strategies for crowding and speciation, two versions of this algorithm are developed, which operate at the niche level. Then these two algorithms are equipped with three distinctive techniques: 1) a dynamic cluster sizing strategy; 2) an alternative utilization of Gaussian and Cauchy distributions to generate offspring; and 3) an adaptive local search. The dynamic cluster sizing affords a potential balance between exploration and exploitation and reduces the sensitivity to the cluster size in the niching methods. Taking advantages of Gaussian and Cauchy distributions, we generate the offspring at the niche level through alternatively using these two distributions. Such utilization can also potentially offer a balance between exploration and exploitation. Further, solution accuracy is enhanced through a new local search scheme probabilistically conducted around seeds of niches with probabilities determined self-adaptively according to fitness values of these seeds. Extensive experiments conducted on 20 benchmark multimodal problems confirm that both algorithms can achieve competitive performance compared with several state-of-the-art multimodal algorithms, which is supported by nonparametric tests.

        "description": "Model-building optimisation methods aim to learn the structure underlying a problem and exploit this to direct the exploration of solutions. This generally interleaves two processes: Generating samples (from the model), and updating the model (using selected samples). In most estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), e.g. BOA, selection is used only in the laSer, to determine which samples are retained for updating the model. In contrast, other evolution-inspired algorithms (such as rHN-G and MACRO) use selection differently - within the process that generates samples from the model. It has been hypothesised that this 'constructive selection' process can facilitate optimisation that other EDAs cannot but this has not been previously shown. Here we investigate these distinctions using constraint optimisation problems with a very simple modular structure. We find that a simple constructive selection method (rHN-g) can solve these problems in time polynomial in the problem size whereas other methods, such as BOA, require exponential time. We confirm that this result arises not from any difficulty in acquiring an accurate model but because of how samples are generated given the model. This suggests that by using constructive selection other EDAs could exploit the models they learn more efficiently to solve otherwise unsolvable problems.",

        "description": "Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) is evolutionary algorithms with relevant performance in handling complex problems. Nevertheless, their efficiency and effectiveness directly depends on how accurate the deployed probabilistic models are, which in turn depend on methods of model building. Although the best models found in the literature are often built by computationally complex methods, whose corresponding EDAs require high running time, these methods may evaluate a lesser number of points in the search space. In order to find a better trade-off between running time (efficiency) and the number of evaluated points (effectiveness), this work uses probabilistic models built by algorithms of phylogenetic reconstruction, since some of them are able to efficiently produce accurate models. Then, an EDA, namely, Optimization based on Phylogram Analysis, and a new search technique, namely, Composed Exhaustive Search, are developed and proposed to find solutions for combinatorial optimization problems with different levels of difficulty. Experimental results show that the proposed new EDA features an interesting trade-off between running time and number of evaluated points, attaining solutions near to the best results found in the literature for each one of such performance measures.

It will be shown that, after a simple repair operation, inferior solutions could be surprisingly useful in adjusting the covariance matrix of Gaussian model, then a better search direction and a more proper search scale can be obtained. Since the aim of Inferior Solution Repairing (ISR) operator is not to directly improve the quality of inferior solutions, but to make them closer to superior ones, it can be implemented in a simple way. Combining ISR and traditional Gaussian EDA, a new EDA variant named ISR-EDA is developed.

To ease the drawbacks, this paper designs a novel clustering-based multivariate Gaussian sampling strategy and proposes an adaptive MEDA called AMEDA. A clustering analysis approach is utilized in AMEDA to discover the distribution structure of the population. Based on the distribution information, with a certain probability, a local or a global multivariate Gaussian model (MGM) is built for each solution to sample a new solution. A covariance sharing strategy is designed in AMEDA to reduce the complexity of building MGMs, and an adaptive update strategy of the probability that controls the contributions of the two types of MGMs is developed to dynamically balance exploration and exploitation. AMEDA is compared with four representative MOEAs on a number of test instances with complex Pareto fronts and variable linkages. Experimental results suggest that AMEDA outperforms the comparison algorithms on dealing with the test instances. The effectiveness of the clustering-based multivariate Gaussian sampling strategy and the adaptive probability update strategy is also experimentally verified.",

The goal is to propose a method that avoids complex approximations of learning a probabilistic graphical model and considers multivariate dependencies between continuous random variables. A parallel model of some subgraphs with a smaller number of variables is learned as the probabilistic graphical model. In each generation, the joint probability distribution of the selected solutions is estimated using a Gaussian Mixture model. Then, learning the graphical model of dependencies among random variables and sampling are done separately for each Gaussian component. In the learning step, using the selected solutions of each Gaussian mixture component, the structure of a Markov network is learned. This network is decomposed to maximal cliques and a clique graph. Then, complete Bayesian network structures are learned for these subgraphs using an optimization algorithm. The proposed optimization problem is a 0-1 constrained quadratic programming which finds the best permutation of variables. Then, sampling is done from each Bayesian network of each Gaussian component.

        "description": "Estimation-of-Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) have been applied with quite some success when solving real-valued optimization problems, especially in the case of Black Box Optimization (BBO). Generally, the performance of an EDA depends on the match between its driving probability distribution and the landscape of the problem being solved. Because most well-known EDAs, including CMA-ES, NES, and AMaLGaM, use a uni-modal search distribution, they have a high risk of getting trapped in local optima when a problem is multi-modal with a (moderate) number of relatively comparable modes. This risk could potentially be mitigated using niching methods that define multiple regions of interest where separate search distributions govern sub-populations. However, a key question is how to determine a suitable number of niches, especially in BBO. In this paper, we present a novel, adaptive niching approach that determines the niches through hierarchical clustering based on the correlation between the probability densities and fitness values of solutions. We test the performance of a combination of this niching approach with AMaLGaM on both new and well-known niching benchmark problems and find that the new approach properly identifies multiple landscape modes, leading to much better performance on multi-modal problems than with a non-niched, uni-modal EDA.y",

Thus, they do not allow for a straightforward application of traditional optimization techniques. In these settings, randomized search heuristics such as evolutionary algorithms are a popular choice because they are often assumed to exhibit some kind of resistance to noise. Empirical evidence suggests that some algorithms, such as estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) are robust against a scaling of the noise intensity, even without resorting to explicit noise-handling techniques such as resampling. In this paper, we want to support such claims with mathematical rigor. We introduce the concept of graceful scaling in which the run time of an algorithm scales polynomially with noise intensity. We study a monotone fitness function over binary strings with additive noise taken from a Gaussian distribution. We show that myopic heuristics cannot efficiently optimize the function under arbitrarily intense noise without any explicit noise-handling. Furthermore, we prove that using a population does not help. Finally, we show that a simple EDA called the compact genetic algorithm can overcome the short-sightedness of mutation-only heuristics to scale gracefully with noise. We conjecture that recombinative genetic algorithms also have this property.",

When building the model, the positions of a series of pixels are taken as the decision variable, and the differences between the colors of pixels and those of a hand are taken as objective functions. A method of gesture segmentation based on a two-phase estimation of distribution algorithm is proposed according to the correlation among the positions of pixels. The method divides the solution of the problem based on evolutionary optimization into two phases, and uses different estimation of distribution algorithms in different phases. In the first phase, the probability model of candidates is formulated by a number of intervals given the fact that the positions of hand pixels distribute in several intervals. In the second phase, the probability model of candidates is built through a series of segments since the positions of hand pixels further distribute around curves. A series of pixels constituting a hand region are obtained based on sampling by the above probability models. The proposed method is applied to 2515 problems of gesture segmentation, and is compared with the existing methods. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Before departure, the optimal speed profile for an entire route is generated by an EDA in combination with speedup approaches for a faster computing time, which can optimize the complex cost function of ecodriving without simplification within a reasonably short computing time. This optimization is performed in a distance domain for localizing changes in the optimal speed profile due to traffic conditions while driving. After departure, by taking the optimal speed profile and actual traffic conditions into consideration, the speed profile for a short term-to only the next location-is adapted. In order to reliably react to actual traffic conditions, additional points are interpolated into the long-term distance step and fine control of speeds at the additional points is established, which is based on a predictive model for estimating the spacing to the preceding vehicle. The proposed ecodriving system is evaluated in two types of route conditions, and its results are compared with the optimization result by the quadratic programming method. This comparison shows that an EDA can generate a speed profile with better optimization results in terms of fuel efficiency and driving time within a shorter computing time.",

A state-of-the-art optimizer for single-objective continuous functions that also uses probabilistic modeling is the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES). Different variants of CMA-ES have been proposed for MOPs however most of them are based on Pareto dominance as the main selection criterion. Recently, a new multi-objective CMA-ES called MOEA/D-CMA was proposed combining the strengths of CMA-ES with those of the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D). Nowadays, however, researchers on MOEAs agree that combining Pareto and decomposition can be beneficial for the search on MOPs. As a result, a new MOEA has been proposed, called MOEA/DD. This algorithm modifies the MOEA/D by including a new Pareto dominance update mechanism that brings more diversity into the search. In this study, we extend the MOEA/D-CMA by replacing its update mechanism by the one of MOEA/DD. The hypothesis is that this update mechanism will improve the performance of MOEA/D-CMA as it improved MOEA/D. MOEA/D-CMA and MOEA/DD-CMA are implemented and evaluated through an experimental study. The experimental study involves two well-known families of benchmark problems whose objective numbers scale from two to fifteen. Then, an extensive statistical analysis of the results is made to extract sound, statistically supported conclusions about the performance of the algorithms as the number of objectives scales.",

In this context the related literature has extensively shown that dynamic time warping is the similarity measure of choice when univariate time series are considered. However, possible statistical coupling among different dimensions make the generalization of this metric to the multivariate case all but obvious. This has ignited the interest of the community in new distance definitions capable of capturing such inter-dimension dependences. In this paper we propose a simple dynamic time warping based distance that finds the best weighted combination between the dependent - where multivariate time series are treated as whole - and independent approaches - where multivariate time series are just a collection of unrelated univariate time series - of the time series to be classified. A benchmark of four heuristic wrappers, namely, simulated annealing, particle swarm optimization, estimation of distribution algorithms and genetic algorithms are used to evolve the set of weighting coefficients towards maximizing the cross-validated predictive score of the classifiers. In this context one of the most recurring classifiers is nearest neighbor. This classifier is couple with a distance that as afore mentioned, in most cases, have been dynamic time warping. The performance of the proposed approach is validated over datasets widely utilized in the related literature, from which it is concluded that the obtained performance gains can be enlarged by properly decoupling the influence of each dimension in the definition of the dependent dynamic time warping distance.",
