        "description": "The research literature on metalieuristic and evolutionary computation has proposed a large number of algorithms for the solution of challenging real-world optimization problems. It is often not possible to study theoretically the performance of these algorithms unless significant assumptions are made on either the algorithm itself or the problems to which it is applied, or both. As a consequence, metalieuristics are typically evaluated empirically using a set of test problems. Unfortunately, relatively little attention has been given to the development of methodologies and tools for the large-scale empirical evaluation and/or comparison of metaheuristics. In this paper, we propose a landscape (test-problem) generator that can be used to generate optimization problem instances for continuous, bound-constrained optimization problems. The landscape generator is parameterized by a small number of parameters, and the values of these parameters have a direct and intuitive interpretation in terms of the geometric features of the landscapes that they produce. An experimental space is defined over algorithms and problems, via a tuple of parameters for any specified algorithm and problem class (here determined by the landscape generator). An experiment is then clearly specified as a point in this space, in a way that is analogous to other areas of experimental algorithmics, and more generally in experimental design. Experimental results are presented, demonstrating the use of the landscape generator. In particular, we analyze some simple, continuous estimation of distribution algorithms, and gain new insights into the behavior of these algorithms using the landscape generator.",

        "description": "The compact Genetic Algorithm (cGA) is an Estimation of Distribution Algorithm that generates offspring population according to the estimated probabilistic model of the parent population instead of using traditional recombination and mutation operators. The cGA only needs a small amount of memory; therefore, it may be quite useful in memory-constrained applications. This paper introduces a theoretical framework for studying the cGA from the convergence point of view in which, we model the cGA by a Markov process and approximate its behavior using an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE). Then, we prove that the corresponding ODE converges to local optima and stays there. Consequently, we conclude that the cGA will converge to the local optima of the function to be optimized.",

Experimental data obtained from reactions which involve known concentrations of two or more components are used to calibrate a model that, later, will be used to predict the (unknown) concentrations of those components in a new reaction. This problem can be seen as a selection + prediction one, where the goal is to obtain good values for the variables to predict while minimizing the number of the input variables needed, taking a small subset of really significant ones. Initial approaches to the problem were principal components analysis and filtering combined with two prediction techniques: artificial neural networks and partial least squares regression. Finally, a parallel estimation of distribution algorithm was used to reduce the number of variables to be used for prediction, yielding the best models for all the considered problems.

The possibilities comprise pure Scatter Search options and Scatter Search-Estimation of Distribution Algorithm collaborations.

Due to the redundant character of a 3M system, its motion planning is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem under the mechanical constraints. After a task space division, optimization parameters are transferred from. joint angles to division points of macro and micro part of the system, which largely reduces the searching space. However, to avoid sucking local extremum, global optimization is too time-cosuming to bear. Instead of searching the division point space directly, EDA is applied to estimate the probability model of the division space and thus extracts mapping information between the optimization function and division points. Simulation results on a planar 4 degree-of-freedom (DOF) macro-micro manipulator system are presented herein to show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.",

However, it often suffers from the small sample size problem when dealing with the high dimensional face data. Some approaches have been proposed to overcome this problem, but they usually utilize all eigenvectors of null or range subspaces of within-class scatter matrix( S-W). However, experimental results testified that not all the eigenvectors in the full space of SW are positive to the classification performance, some of which might be negative. As far as we know, there have been no effective ways to determine which eigenvectors should be adopted. This paper proposes a new method EDA + Full-space LDA, which takes full advantage of the discriminative information of the null and range subspaces of S-W by selecting an optimal subset of eigenvectors. An Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) is used to pursuit a subset of eigenvectors with significant discriminative information in full space of S-W.

So a new automatic programming method is proposed: Gene Estimated Gene Expression Programming(GEGEP) which combines the advantages of Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) and basic GEP. Compared with basic GEP, it mainly has the following characteristics: First, improve the gene expression structure, the head of gene is divided into a head and a body, which can be used to introduce learning mechanism. Second, the homeotic gene which is also composed of a head, a body and a tail is used which can increase its searching ability.

Moreover, the population convergence rate can be controlled with a variance-scaling factor. CMR is a simple, yet robust and efficient operator. It eliminates the requirement for evaluating an explicit probabilistic model and thus the associated errors and computation. It implicitly models the full set of d(d-1)/2 interdependencies between components, yet its computation complexity is only O(d) per solution (d denotes the problem dimension).

Case studies are conducted on both unimodal and multimodal problems to highlight the effectiveness of the proposed technique and explore some important properties of the EDA. With some general assumptions, we show that, for 1D unimodal problem and with the (mu, lambda) scheme: (1). The behaviour of the EDA is dependent only on the general shape of the test function, rather than its specific form; (2). When initialized far from the global optimum, the EDA has a tendency to converge prematurely; (3). Given a certain selection pressure, there is a unique value for the proposed amplification parameter that could help the EDA achieve desirable performance; for 1D multimodal problems: (1). The EDA could get stuck with the (mu, lambda) scheme; (2). The EDA will never get stuck with the (mu+lambda) scheme.",

Gait synthesis of the biped locomotion is firstly formulated as a multi-constraint optimization problem with consideration of two objectives, including zero-moment point (ZMP) for dynamically stable locomotion and driving torque for energy efficiency. The parameters to be optimized are joint coordinates at transition poses between three successive phases. Rather than searching in joint angle permutation space directly, the proposed method approximates the probability distribution by Catmull-Rom (CR) cubic spline function and updates them with gradient descent learning strategy. The effectiveness of EDA_S for biped gait optimization has been successfully tested on the simulated model of a humanoid soccer robot. It is shown that the flexible kernel with the updating rule is able to remarkably accelerate the learning speed with comparison to the traditional EDA.",

Machine learning is used to learn probabilistic models of the selected population. This model is then used to generate next population via sampling.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate. whether overfitting happens in EDAs, and to discover its consequences. What is found is: overfitting does occur in EDAs; overfitting correlates to EDAs performance; reduction of overfitting using early stopping can improve EDAs performance.",

Similar to typical population based optimisation algorithms, e.g. genetic algorithms (GAs), EDAs maintain a population of solutions and evolve them during the optimisation process. Unlike GAs, new solutions are suggested by sampling the distribution estimated from all the solutions evaluated so far. We have developed new algorithms based on the EDAs approach, which are applied to maximize the effective multiplication factor (K-eff) of the CONSORT research reactor of Imperial College London. In the new algorithms, a new 'elite-guided' strategy and the 'stand-alone' K-eff with fuel coupling is used as heuristic information to improve the optimisation. A detailed comparison study between the EDAs and GAs with previously published crossover operators is presented. A trained three-layer feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN) was used as a fast approximate model to replace the three-dimensional finite element reactor simulation code EVENT in predicting the K-eff. Results from the numerical experiments have shown that the EDAs used provide accurate, efficient and robust algorithms for the test case studied here. This encourages further investigation of the performance of EDAs on more realistic problems. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

This class is very general; it includes simple forms of many well-known EDAs, e.g. BOA, MIMIC, FDA, UMDA, etc. To study the diversity loss in SML-EDAs, the trace of the empirical covariance matrix is the proposed statistic. Two simple results are derived. Let N be the number of data vectors evaluated in each generation. It is shown that on a flat landscape, the expected value of the statistic decreases by a factor 1 - 1/N in each generation.

Then, an adaptive variance scaling theme is introduced that aims at reducing the risk of premature convergence. Integrating the scheme into the iterated density-estimation evolutionary algorithm (IDEA) yields the correlation-triggered adaptive variance scaling IDEA (CT-AVS-IDEA). The CT-AVS-IDEA is compared to the original IDEA and the Evolution Strategy with Covariance Matrix Adaptation (CMA-ES) on a wide range of unimodal test-problems by means of a scalability analysis. It is found that the average number of fitness evaluations grows subiquadratically with the dimensionality, competitively with the CMA-ES.

The efficiency of these algorithms is heavily dependent on the model accuracy. In this work, a generic framework for enhancing the model accuracy by incorporating statistical variable dependencies is presented. The proposed algorithm uses two distributions simultaneously: the marginal distributions of the design variables, complemented by the distribution of physically meaningful auxiliary variables. The combination of the two generates more accurate distributions of promising regions at a low computational cost. The paper demonstrates the efficiency of DDOA for three laminate optimization problems where the design variables are the fiber angles, and the auxiliary variables are integral quantities called lamination parameters. The results show that the reliability of DDOA in finding the optima is greater than that of simple EDA and a standard genetic algorithm, and that its advantage increases with the problem dimension.",

The difficulty of estimating the exact Boltzmann distribution in continuous state space is circumvented by adopting the multivariate Gaussian model, which is popular in continuous EDA, to approximate only the final sampling distribution. With the minimum Kullback-Leibeler divergence principle, both the mean vector and the covariance matrix of the Gaussian model can be calibrated to preserve the features of Boltzmann selection reflecting desired selection pressure. A method is proposed to adapt the selection pressure based on measuring the successfulness of the past evolution process. These works established a formal basis that helps to build probabilistic models in continuous EDA algorithms with adaptive parameters. The framework is incorporated in both the continuous UMDA and the EMNA algorithm, and tested in several benchmark problems.

With sporadic model building, the structure of the probabilistic model is updated once every few iterations (generations), whereas in the remaining iterations only model parameters (conditional and marginal probabilities) axe updated. Since the time complexity of updating model parameters is much lower than the time complexity of learning the model structure, sporadic model building decreases the overall time complexity of model building. The paper shows that for boundedly difficult nearly decomposable and hierarchical optimization problems, sporadic model building leads to a significant model-building speedup that decreases the asymptotic time complexity of model building in hBOA by a factor of Theta(n(0.26)) to Theta(n(0.5)), where n is the problem size. On the other hand, sporadic model building also increases the number of evaluations until convergence; nonetheless, the evaluation slowdown is insignificant compared to the gains in the asymptotic complexity of model building.",

Simple crossover operators were replaced by recombination based on estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). The combination showed that XCS with such a statistics-based crossover operator can solve challenging hierarchical functions more efficiently. This study elaborates the gained competence further investigating the coding scheme for the EDA component (BOA in our case) of XCS as well as performance in randomly generated Boolean function problems. Results in hierarchical Boolean functions show that the originally used 2-bit coding scheme induces a certain learning bias that stresses additional diversity in the evolving XCS population. A I-bit coding scheme as well as a restricted 2-bit coding scheme confirm the suspected bias. The alternative encodings decrease the unnecessary bias towards specificity and increase performance robustness. The paper concludes with a discussion on the challenges ahead for XCS in Boolean function problems as well as on the implications of the obtained results for real-valued and multiple-valued classification problems, multistep problems, and function approximation problems.",

The question is how good representations can be found and how they can be adapted online to account for what can be learned about the structure of the problem from previous samples. We address these questions in a scenario that we term indirect Estimation-of-Distribution: We consider a decorrelated search distribution (mutational variability) on a variable length genotype space. A one-to-one encoding onto the phenotype space then needs to induce an adapted phenotypic search distribution incorporating the dependencies between phenotypic variables that have been observed successful previously. Formalizing this in the framework of Estimation-of-Distribution Algorithms, an adapted phenotypic search distribution can be characterized as minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) to a population of previously selected samples (parents). The paper derives a relation between this KLD and the description length of the encoding, stating that compact representations provide a way to minimize the divergence.

        "description": "A new biped gait generation and optimization method is proposed in the frame of Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) with Q-learning method. By formulating the biped gait synthesis as a constrained multi-objective optimization problem, a dynamically stable and low energy cost biped gait is generated by EDAs with Q-learning (EDA_Q), which estimate probability distributions derived from the objective function to be optimized to generate searching points in the highly-coupled and high dimensional working space of biped robots. To get the preferable permutation of the interrelated parameters, Q-learning is combined to build and modify the probability models in EDA autonomously. By making use of the global optimization capability of EDA, the proposed EDA_Q can also solve the local minima problem in traditional Q-learning.

Similar to typical population based optimisation algorithms, e.g. genetic algorithms (GAs), EDAs maintain a population of solutions and evolve them during the optimisation process. Unlike GAs, new solutions are suggested by sampling the distribution estimated from all the solutions evaluated so far. We have developed new algorithms based on the EDAs approach, which are applied to maximize the effective multiplication factor (K-eff) of the CONSORT research reactor of Imperial College London. In the new algorithms, a new 'elite-guided' strategy and the 'stand-alone' K-eff with fuel coupling is used as heuristic information to improve the optimisation. A detailed comparison study between the EDAs and GAs with previously published crossover operators is presented. A trained three-layer feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN) was used as a fast approximate model to replace the three-dimensional finite element reactor simulation code EVENT in predicting the K-eff. Results from the numerical experiments have shown that the EDAs used provide accurate, efficient and robust algorithms for the test case studied here. This encourages further investigation of the performance of EDAs on more realistic problems. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

This class is very general; it includes simple forms of many well-known EDAs, e.g. BOA, MIMIC, FDA, UMDA, etc. To study the diversity loss in SML-EDAs, the trace of the empirical covariance matrix is the proposed statistic. Two simple results are derived. Let N be the number of data vectors evaluated in each generation. It is shown that on a flat landscape, the expected value of the statistic decreases by a factor 1 - 1/N in each generation.

Then, an adaptive variance scaling theme is introduced that aims at reducing the risk of premature convergence. Integrating the scheme into the iterated density-estimation evolutionary algorithm (IDEA) yields the correlation-triggered adaptive variance scaling IDEA (CT-AVS-IDEA). The CT-AVS-IDEA is compared to the original IDEA and the Evolution Strategy with Covariance Matrix Adaptation (CMA-ES) on a wide range of unimodal test-problems by means of a scalability analysis. It is found that the average number of fitness evaluations grows subiquadratically with the dimensionality, competitively with the CMA-ES.

The efficiency of these algorithms is heavily dependent on the model accuracy. In this work, a generic framework for enhancing the model accuracy by incorporating statistical variable dependencies is presented. The proposed algorithm uses two distributions simultaneously: the marginal distributions of the design variables, complemented by the distribution of physically meaningful auxiliary variables. The combination of the two generates more accurate distributions of promising regions at a low computational cost. The paper demonstrates the efficiency of DDOA for three laminate optimization problems where the design variables are the fiber angles, and the auxiliary variables are integral quantities called lamination parameters. The results show that the reliability of DDOA in finding the optima is greater than that of simple EDA and a standard genetic algorithm, and that its advantage increases with the problem dimension.",

The difficulty of estimating the exact Boltzmann distribution in continuous state space is circumvented by adopting the multivariate Gaussian model, which is popular in continuous EDA, to approximate only the final sampling distribution. With the minimum Kullback-Leibeler divergence principle, both the mean vector and the covariance matrix of the Gaussian model can be calibrated to preserve the features of Boltzmann selection reflecting desired selection pressure. A method is proposed to adapt the selection pressure based on measuring the successfulness of the past evolution process. These works established a formal basis that helps to build probabilistic models in continuous EDA algorithms with adaptive parameters. The framework is incorporated in both the continuous UMDA and the EMNA algorithm, and tested in several benchmark problems. The experiment results are compared with some existing EDA versions and the benefit of the proposed approach is discussed.",

With sporadic model building, the structure of the probabilistic model is updated once every few iterations (generations), whereas in the remaining iterations only model parameters (conditional and marginal probabilities) axe updated. Since the time complexity of updating model parameters is much lower than the time complexity of learning the model structure, sporadic model building decreases the overall time complexity of model building. The paper shows that for boundedly difficult nearly decomposable and hierarchical optimization problems, sporadic model building leads to a significant model-building speedup that decreases the asymptotic time complexity of model building in hBOA by a factor of Theta(n(0.26)) to Theta(n(0.5)), where n is the problem size. On the other hand, sporadic model building also increases the number of evaluations until convergence; nonetheless, the evaluation slowdown is insignificant compared to the gains in the asymptotic complexity of model building.",

Simple crossover operators were replaced by recombination based on estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). The combination showed that XCS with such a statistics-based crossover operator can solve challenging hierarchical functions more efficiently. This study elaborates the gained competence further investigating the coding scheme for the EDA component (BOA in our case) of XCS as well as performance in randomly generated Boolean function problems. Results in hierarchical Boolean functions show that the originally used 2-bit coding scheme induces a certain learning bias that stresses additional diversity in the evolving XCS population. A I-bit coding scheme as well as a restricted 2-bit coding scheme confirm the suspected bias. The alternative encodings decrease the unnecessary bias towards specificity and increase performance robustness. The paper concludes with a discussion on the challenges ahead for XCS in Boolean function problems as well as on the implications of the obtained results for real-valued and multiple-valued classification problems, multistep problems, and function approximation problems.",

The question is how good representations can be found and how they can be adapted online to account for what can be learned about the structure of the problem from previous samples. We address these questions in a scenario that we term indirect Estimation-of-Distribution: We consider a decorrelated search distribution (mutational variability) on a variable length genotype space. A one-to-one encoding onto the phenotype space then needs to induce an adapted phenotypic search distribution incorporating the dependencies between phenotypic variables that have been observed successful previously. Formalizing this in the framework of Estimation-of-Distribution Algorithms, an adapted phenotypic search distribution can be characterized as minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) to a population of previously selected samples (parents). The paper derives a relation between this KLD and the description length of the encoding, stating that compact representations provide a way to minimize the divergence.

Similar to typical population based optimisation algorithms, e.g. genetic algorithms (GAs), EDAs maintain a population of solutions and evolve them during the optimisation process. Unlike GAs, new solutions are suggested by sampling the distribution estimated from all the solutions evaluated so far. We have developed new algorithms based on the EDAs approach, which are applied to maximize the effective multiplication factor (K-eff) of the CONSORT research reactor of Imperial College London. In the new algorithms, a new 'elite-guided' strategy and the 'stand-alone' K-eff with fuel coupling is used as heuristic information to improve the optimisation. A detailed comparison study between the EDAs and GAs with previously published crossover operators is presented. A trained three-layer feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN) was used as a fast approximate model to replace the three-dimensional finite element reactor simulation code EVENT in predicting the K-eff. Results from the numerical experiments have shown that the EDAs used provide accurate, efficient and robust algorithms for the test case studied here. This encourages further investigation of the performance of EDAs on more realistic problems. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

This class is very general; it includes simple forms of many well-known EDAs, e.g. BOA, MIMIC, FDA, UMDA, etc. To study the diversity loss in SML-EDAs, the trace of the empirical covariance matrix is the proposed statistic. Two simple results are derived. Let N be the number of data vectors evaluated in each generation. It is shown that on a flat landscape, the expected value of the statistic decreases by a factor 1 - 1/N in each generation.

Then, an adaptive variance scaling theme is introduced that aims at reducing the risk of premature convergence. Integrating the scheme into the iterated density-estimation evolutionary algorithm (IDEA) yields the correlation-triggered adaptive variance scaling IDEA (CT-AVS-IDEA). The CT-AVS-IDEA is compared to the original IDEA and the Evolution Strategy with Covariance Matrix Adaptation (CMA-ES) on a wide range of unimodal test-problems by means of a scalability analysis. It is found that the average number of fitness evaluations grows subiquadratically with the dimensionality, competitively with the CMA-ES.

The efficiency of these algorithms is heavily dependent on the model accuracy. In this work, a generic framework for enhancing the model accuracy by incorporating statistical variable dependencies is presented. The proposed algorithm uses two distributions simultaneously: the marginal distributions of the design variables, complemented by the distribution of physically meaningful auxiliary variables. The combination of the two generates more accurate distributions of promising regions at a low computational cost. The paper demonstrates the efficiency of DDOA for three laminate optimization problems where the design variables are the fiber angles, and the auxiliary variables are integral quantities called lamination parameters. The results show that the reliability of DDOA in finding the optima is greater than that of simple EDA and a standard genetic algorithm, and that its advantage increases with the problem dimension.",

The difficulty of estimating the exact Boltzmann distribution in continuous state space is circumvented by adopting the multivariate Gaussian model, which is popular in continuous EDA, to approximate only the final sampling distribution. With the minimum Kullback-Leibeler divergence principle, both the mean vector and the covariance matrix of the Gaussian model can be calibrated to preserve the features of Boltzmann selection reflecting desired selection pressure. A method is proposed to adapt the selection pressure based on measuring the successfulness of the past evolution process. These works established a formal basis that helps to build probabilistic models in continuous EDA algorithms with adaptive parameters. The framework is incorporated in both the continuous UMDA and the EMNA algorithm, and tested in several benchmark problems.

With sporadic model building, the structure of the probabilistic model is updated once every few iterations (generations), whereas in the remaining iterations only model parameters (conditional and marginal probabilities) axe updated. Since the time complexity of updating model parameters is much lower than the time complexity of learning the model structure, sporadic model building decreases the overall time complexity of model building. The paper shows that for boundedly difficult nearly decomposable and hierarchical optimization problems, sporadic model building leads to a significant model-building speedup that decreases the asymptotic time complexity of model building in hBOA by a factor of Theta(n(0.26)) to Theta(n(0.5)), where n is the problem size. On the other hand, sporadic model building also increases the number of evaluations until convergence; nonetheless, the evaluation slowdown is insignificant compared to the gains in the asymptotic complexity of model building.",

Simple crossover operators were replaced by recombination based on estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). The combination showed that XCS with such a statistics-based crossover operator can solve challenging hierarchical functions more efficiently. This study elaborates the gained competence further investigating the coding scheme for the EDA component (BOA in our case) of XCS as well as performance in randomly generated Boolean function problems. Results in hierarchical Boolean functions show that the originally used 2-bit coding scheme induces a certain learning bias that stresses additional diversity in the evolving XCS population. A I-bit coding scheme as well as a restricted 2-bit coding scheme confirm the suspected bias. The alternative encodings decrease the unnecessary bias towards specificity and increase performance robustness. The paper concludes with a discussion on the challenges ahead for XCS in Boolean function problems as well as on the implications of the obtained results for real-valued and multiple-valued classification problems, multistep problems, and function approximation problems.",

The question is how good representations can be found and how they can be adapted online to account for what can be learned about the structure of the problem from previous samples. We address these questions in a scenario that we term indirect Estimation-of-Distribution: We consider a decorrelated search distribution (mutational variability) on a variable length genotype space. A one-to-one encoding onto the phenotype space then needs to induce an adapted phenotypic search distribution incorporating the dependencies between phenotypic variables that have been observed successful previously. Formalizing this in the framework of Estimation-of-Distribution Algorithms, an adapted phenotypic search distribution can be characterized as minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) to a population of previously selected samples (parents). The paper derives a relation between this KLD and the description length of the encoding, stating that compact representations provide a way to minimize the divergence.

To get the preferable permutation of the interrelated parameters, Q-learning is combined to build and modify the probability models in EDA autonomously. By making use of the global optimization capability of EDA, the proposed EDA_Q can also solve the local minima problem in traditional Q-learning. On the other hand, with the learning agent, EDA_Q can evaluate the probability distribution model regularly without pre-designed structure and updating rule.

Unlike GAs, new solutions are suggested by sampling the distribution estimated from all the solutions evaluated so far. We have developed new algorithms based on the EDAs approach, which are applied to maximize the effective multiplication factor (K-eff) of the CONSORT research reactor of Imperial College London. In the new algorithms, a new 'elite-guided' strategy and the 'stand-alone' K-eff with fuel coupling is used as heuristic information to improve the optimisation. A detailed comparison study between the EDAs and GAs with previously published crossover operators is presented. A trained three-layer feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN) was used as a fast approximate model to replace the three-dimensional finite element reactor simulation code EVENT in predicting the K-eff. Results from the numerical experiments have shown that the EDAs used provide accurate, efficient and robust algorithms for the test case studied here. This encourages further investigation of the performance of EDAs on more realistic problems. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "description": "A very general class of EDAs is defined, on which universal results on the rate of diversity loss can be derived. This EDA class, denoted SML-EDA, requires two restrictions: 1) in each generation, the new probability model is build using only data sampled from the current probability model; and 2) maximum likelihood is used to set model parameters. This class is very general; it includes simple forms of many well-known EDAs, e.g. BOA, MIMIC, FDA, UMDA, etc. To study the diversity loss in SML-EDAs, the trace of the empirical covariance matrix is the proposed statistic. Two simple results are derived. Let N be the number of data vectors evaluated in each generation. It is shown that on a flat landscape, the expected value of the statistic decreases by a factor 1 - 1/N in each generation. This result is used to show that for the Needle problem, the algorithm will with a high probability never find the optimum unless the population size grows exponentially in the number of search variables.",

This paper takes a principled first step towards solving this problem. First, prerequisites for the successful use of search distributions in EDAs are presented. Then, an adaptive variance scaling theme is introduced that aims at reducing the risk of premature convergence. Integrating the scheme into the iterated density-estimation evolutionary algorithm (IDEA) yields the correlation-triggered adaptive variance scaling IDEA (CT-AVS-IDEA). The CT-AVS-IDEA is compared to the original IDEA and the Evolution Strategy with Covariance Matrix Adaptation (CMA-ES) on a wide range of unimodal test-problems by means of a scalability analysis. It is found that the average number of fitness evaluations grows subiquadratically with the dimensionality, competitively with the CMA-ES. In addition, CT-AVS-IDEA is indeed found to enlarge the class of problems that continuous EDAs can solve reliably.",

DDOA belongs to the family of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDA) that build a statistical model of promising regions of the design space based on sets of good points and use it to guide the search. The efficiency of these algorithms is heavily dependent on the model accuracy. In this work, a generic framework for enhancing the model accuracy by incorporating statistical variable dependencies is presented. The proposed algorithm uses two distributions simultaneously: the marginal distributions of the design variables, complemented by the distribution of physically meaningful auxiliary variables. The combination of the two generates more accurate distributions of promising regions at a low computational cost. The paper demonstrates the efficiency of DDOA for three laminate optimization problems where the design variables are the fiber angles, and the auxiliary variables are integral quantities called lamination parameters. The results show that the reliability of DDOA in finding the optima is greater than that of simple EDA and a standard genetic algorithm, and that its advantage increases with the problem dimension.",

The difficulty of estimating the exact Boltzmann distribution in continuous state space is circumvented by adopting the multivariate Gaussian model, which is popular in continuous EDA, to approximate only the final sampling distribution. With the minimum Kullback-Leibeler divergence principle, both the mean vector and the covariance matrix of the Gaussian model can be calibrated to preserve the features of Boltzmann selection reflecting desired selection pressure. A method is proposed to adapt the selection pressure based on measuring the successfulness of the past evolution process. These works established a formal basis that helps to build probabilistic models in continuous EDA algorithms with adaptive parameters. The framework is incorporated in both the continuous UMDA and the EMNA algorithm, and tested in several benchmark problems. The experiment results are compared with some existing EDA versions and the benefit of the proposed approach is discussed.",

With sporadic model building, the structure of the probabilistic model is updated once every few iterations (generations), whereas in the remaining iterations only model parameters (conditional and marginal probabilities) axe updated. Since the time complexity of updating model parameters is much lower than the time complexity of learning the model structure, sporadic model building decreases the overall time complexity of model building. The paper shows that for boundedly difficult nearly decomposable and hierarchical optimization problems, sporadic model building leads to a significant model-building speedup that decreases the asymptotic time complexity of model building in hBOA by a factor of Theta(n(0.26)) to Theta(n(0.5)), where n is the problem size. On the other hand, sporadic model building also increases the number of evaluations until convergence; nonetheless, the evaluation slowdown is insignificant compared to the gains in the asymptotic complexity of model building.",

        "description": "Recently, studies with the XCS classifier system on Boolean functions have shown that in certain types of functions simple crossover operators can lead to disruption and, consequently, a more effective recombination mechanism is required. Simple crossover operators were replaced by recombination based on estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). The combination showed that XCS with such a statistics-based crossover operator can solve challenging hierarchical functions more efficiently. This study elaborates the gained competence further investigating the coding scheme for the EDA component (BOA in our case) of XCS as well as performance in randomly generated Boolean function problems. Results in hierarchical Boolean functions show that the originally used 2-bit coding scheme induces a certain learning bias that stresses additional diversity in the evolving XCS population. A I-bit coding scheme as well as a restricted 2-bit coding scheme confirm the suspected bias. The alternative encodings decrease the unnecessary bias towards specificity and increase performance robustness. The paper concludes with a discussion on the challenges ahead for XCS in Boolean function problems as well as on the implications of the obtained results for real-valued and multiple-valued classification problems, multistep problems, and function approximation problems.",

The question is how good representations can be found and how they can be adapted online to account for what can be learned about the structure of the problem from previous samples. We address these questions in a scenario that we term indirect Estimation-of-Distribution: We consider a decorrelated search distribution (mutational variability) on a variable length genotype space. A one-to-one encoding onto the phenotype space then needs to induce an adapted phenotypic search distribution incorporating the dependencies between phenotypic variables that have been observed successful previously. Formalizing this in the framework of Estimation-of-Distribution Algorithms, an adapted phenotypic search distribution can be characterized as minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) to a population of previously selected samples (parents). The paper derives a relation between this KLD and the description length of the encoding, stating that compact representations provide a way to minimize the divergence.

To get the preferable permutation of the interrelated parameters, Q-learning is combined to build and modify the probability models in EDA autonomously. By making use of the global optimization capability of EDA, the proposed EDA_Q can also solve the local minima problem in traditional Q-learning. On the other hand, with the learning agent, EDA_Q can evaluate the probability distribution model regularly without pre-designed structure and updating rule.
