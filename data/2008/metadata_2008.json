        "description": "Genetic programming (GP) is a powerful optimization algorithm that has been applied to a variety of problems. This algorithm can, however, suffer from problems arising from the fact that a crossover, which is a main genetic operator in GP, randomly selects crossover points, and so building blocks may be destroyed by the action of this operator. In recent years, evolutionary algorithms based on probabilistic techniques have been proposed in order to overcome this problem. In the present study, we propose a new program evolution algorithm employing a Bayesian network for generating new individuals. It employs a special chromosome called the expanded parse tree, which significantly reduces the size of the conditional probability table (CPT). Prior prototype tree-based approaches have been faced with the problem of huge CPTs, which not only require significant memory resources, but also many samples in order to construct the Bayesian network. By applying the present approach to three distinct computational experiments, the effectiveness of this new approach for dealing with deceptive problems is demonstrated.",

The locomotion planning and control, along with an introduction of hierarchical control architecture, vision-based behavior and its application in the Humanoid TeenSize soccer challenge, are elaborated. The Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) is used in locomotion generation and optimization to achieves dynamically stable walk and a powerful kick. By setting different objective functions, smooth walking and powerful kicking can be generated quickly. RESr-1 made its debut at RoboCup 2007, and got fourth place in the Humanoid TeenSize penalty kick competition. In addition, some experimental results on RESr-1's walking, tracking and kicking are presented.",

        "description": "Simplified lattice models have played an important role in protein structure prediction and protein folding problems. These models can be useful for an initial approximation of the protein structure, and for the investigation of the dynamics that govern the protein folding process. Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) are efficient evolutionary algorithms that can learn and exploit the search space regularities in the form of probabilistic dependencies. This paper introduces the application of different variants of EDAs to the solution of the protein structure prediction problem in simplified models, and proposes their use as a simulation tool for the analysis of the protein folding process. We develop new ideas for the application of EDAs to the bidimensional and tridimensional (2-d and 3-d) simplified protein folding problems. This paper analyzes the rationale behind the application of EDAs to these problems, and elucidates the relationship between our proposal and other population-based approaches proposed for the protein folding problem. We argue that EDAs are an efficient alternative for many instances of the protein structure prediction problem and are indeed appropriate for a theoretical analysis of search procedures in lattice models. All the algorithms introduced are tested on a set of difficult 2-d and 3-d instances from lattice models. Some of the results obtained with EDAs are superior to the ones obtained with other well-known population-based optimization algorithms.",

        "description": "A transonic airfoil designed by means of classical point-optimization may result in its dramatically inferior performance under off-design conditions. To overcome this shortcoming, robust design is proposed to find out the optimal profile of an airfoil to maintain its performance in an uncertain environment. The robust airfoil optimization is aimed to minimize mean values and variances of drag coefficients while satisfying the lift and thickness constraints over a range of Mach numbers. A multi-objective estimation of distribution algorithm is applied to the robust airfoil optimization on the base of the RAE2822 benchmark airfoil. The shape of the airfoil is obtained through superposing ten Hick-Henne shape functions upon the benchmark airfoil. A set of design points is selected according to a uniform design table for aerodynamic evaluation. A Kriging model of drag coefficient is constructed with those points to reduce computing costs. Over the Mach range from 0.7 to 0.8, the airfoil generated by the robust optimization has a configuration characterized by super-critical airfoil with low drag coefficients. The small fluctuation in its drag coefficients means that the performance of the robust airfoil is insensitive to variation of Mach number.",

        "description": "Multivariate Gaussian models are widely adopted in continuous estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), and covariance matrix plays the essential role in guiding the evolution. In this paper, we propose a new framework for multivariate Gaussian based EDAs (MGEDAs), named eigen decomposition EDA (ED-EDA). Unlike classical EDAs, ED-EDA focuses on eigen analysis of the covariance matrix, and it explicitly tunes the eigenvalues. All existing MGEDAs can be unified within our ED-EDA framework by applying three different eigenvalue tuning strategies. The effects of eigenvalue on influencing the evolution are investigated through combining maximum likelihood estimates of Gaussian model with each of the eigenvalue tuning strategies in ED-EDA. In our experiments, proper eigenvalue tunings show high efficiency in solving problems with small population sizes, which are difficult for classical MGEDA adopting maximum likelihood estimates alone. Previously developed covariance matrix repairing (CMR) methods focusing on repairing computational errors of covariance matrix can be seen as a special eigenvalue tuning strategy. By using the ED-EDA framework, the computational time of CMR methods can be reduced from cubic to linear. Two new efficient CMR methods are proposed. Through explicitly tuning eigenvalues, ED-EDA provides a new approach to develop more efficient Gaussian based EDAs. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

HyEDA is a two-stage hybrid approach which integrates an estimation of distribution algorithm, a K-means clustering method, and a simple local search algorithm.

        "description": "This paper studies the probability distribution functions of the parameters to be learned and optimized in biped gait generation. By formulating the gait pattern generation into a multiobjective optimization problem with consideration of geometric and state constraints, dynamically stable and low energy cost biped gaits are generated and optimized by the proposed method, namely Spline-based Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) with Q-learning updating rule (EDA_S_Q). Instead of assuming variables as independent ones, the relationship between them is exploited by formulating the corresponding probability models with the Catmull-Rom cubic spline function. Such kind of function is proved to be a suboptimal and adaptive realization of the cubic spline function and is capable of providing high-precision description. Moreover, the probability models are updated autonomously by Q-learning method, which is model-free and adaptive. Thus, EDA_S_Q can deal with complex probability distribution functions without a prior knowledge about the distribution. The biped gait generated by EDA_S_Q has been verified using the simulation model of a humanoid soccer robot Robo-Erectus. It also shows that EDA_S_Q can generate the desired biped gaits autonomously in short learning epochs. An interpretation of the transition probability distribution achieved by EDA_S_Q provides us easy understanding for biped locomotion and better control in humanoid robots.",

        "description": "Under mild conditions, it can be induced from the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker condition that the Pareto set, in the decision space, of a continuous multiobjective optimization problem is a piecewise continuous (m - 1)-D manifold, where m Is the number of objectives. Based on this regularity property, we propose a regularity model-based multiobjective estimation of distribution algorithm (RM-MEDA) for continuous multiobjective optimization problems with variable linkages. At each generation, the proposed algorithm models a promising area in the decision space by a probability distribution whose centroid is a (m - 1) -D piecewise continuous manifold. The local principal component analysis algorithm is used for building such a model. New trial solutions are sampled from the model thus built. A nondominated sorting-based selection is used for choosing solutions for the next generation. Systematic experiments have shown that, overall, RM-MEDA outperforms three other state-of-the-art algorithms, namely, GDE3, PCX-NSGA-II, and MIDEA, on a set of test instances with variable linkages. We have demonstrated that, compared with GDE3, RM-MEDA is not sensitive to algorithmic parameters, and has good scalability to the number of decision variables in the case of nonlinear variable linkages. A few shortcomings of RM-MEDA have also been identified and discussed in this paper.",

In recent years, several approaches that use metaheuristic search techniques to automatically obtain the test inputs have been proposed. Although work in this field is very active, little attention has been paid to the selection of an appropriate search space. The present work describes an alternative to this issue. More precisely, two approaches which employ an Estimation of Distribution Algorithm as the metaheuristic technique are explained. In both cases, different regions are considered in the search for the test inputs. Moreover, to depart from a region near to the one containing the optimum, the definition of the initial search space incorporates static information extracted from the source code of the software under test. If this information is not enough to complete the definition, then a grid search method is used. According to the results of the experiments conducted, it is concluded that this is a promising option that can be used to enhance the test data generation process.",

        "description": "This paper addresses the optimization and stabilization problem for networked control systems (NCSs). The memoryless state feedback controller is considered, and the resulting closed-loop NCS is modeled as a discrete-time switch system. By defining a state-dependent Lyapunov function, the stability conditions are derived for NCSs in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Based on the obtained stability conditions, the corresponding controller design problem is solved, and Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) is used to select the optimal state feedback stabilizing gain. It is shown that the proposed method can be easily implemented to various applications, since it is simple and has no assumptions on time delays and packet losses. Simulation results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

A novel 'mulliple' smoothing parameters, which is different from the standard algorithm in which only single smoothing parameter was adopted (Matlab neural network toolbox, for example), were assigned to GRNN model. K-means clustering algorithm was developed so as to reduce the number of smoothing parameters. The training data was firstly partitioned into groups (the number of groups was much smaller than that of training samples) using K-means clustering. A smoothing parameter was then assigned to this group. A recently emerging estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) was employed to optimize the multiple smoothing parameters. EDA presented in this paper was a kind of optimization algorithm based on Gaussian probability distribution. As a case study, the proposed approach was applied to establish a non-linear model between the parameters of the coal-fired boiler and the NOx emissions. The results showed that the number of cluster has significant effect on the predictive accuracy of GRNN model. GRNN model with multiple smoothing parameters showed better agreement than that with only one smoothing parameter. The modeling errors on the testing subset were 1.24% and 1.62% for GRNN models trained by the present algorithm and the standard algorithm, respectively.",

        "description": "Selection is one of the defining characteristics of an evolutionary algorithm, yet inherent in the selection process is the loss of some information from a population. Poor solutions may provide information about how to bias the search toward good solutions. Many Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) use truncation selection which discards all solutions below a certain fitness, thus losing this information. Our previous work on Distribution Estimation using Markov networks (DEUM) has described an EDA which constructs a model of the fitness function; a unique feature of this approach is that because selective pressure is built into the model itself selection becomes optional. This paper outlines a series of experiments which make use of this property to examine the effects of selection on the population. We look at the impact of selecting only highly fit solutions, only poor solutions, selecting a mixture of highly fit and poor solutions, and abandoning selection altogether. We show that in some circumstances, particularly where some information about the problem is already known, selection of the fittest only is suboptimal.",

The biological experiments are expensive and the problem is NP-hard computationally. We have proposed Estimation of Distribution Algorithm for Motif Discovery (EDAMD). We use Bayesian analysis to derive the fitness function to measure the posterior probability of a set of motif instances, which can be used to handle a variable number of motif instances in the sequences. EDAMD adopts a Gaussian distribution to model the distribution of the sets of motif instances, which is capable of capturing the bivariate correlation among the positions of motif instances. When a new Position Frequency Matrix (PFM) is generated from the Gaussian distribution, a new set of motif instances is identified based on the PFM via the Greedy Refinement operation. At the end of a generation, the Gaussian distribution is updated with the sets of motif instances. Since Greedy Refinement assumes a single motif instance on a sequence, a Post Processing operation based on the fitness function is used to find more motif instances after the evolution. The experiments have verified that EDAMD is comparable to or better than GAME and GALF on the real problems tested in this paper.",

In spite of its simplicity, logistic regression has shown very good performance in a range of fields. It is widely accepted in a range of fields because its results are easy to interpret. Fitting the logistic regression model usually involves using the principle of maximum likelihood. The Newton-Raphson algorithm is the most common numerical approach for obtaining the coefficients maximizing the likelihood of the data.|This work presents a novel approach for fitting the logistic regression model based on estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), a tool for evolutionary computation. EDAs are suitable not only for maximizing the likelihood, but also for maximizing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).|Thus, we tackle the logistic regression problem from a double perspective: likelihood-based to calibrate the model and AUC-based to discriminate between the different classes.

We then show how multi-variate EDAs linkage learning mechanisms can be misled with the help of two test problems; the concatenated parity function (CPF), and the concatenated parity/trapfunction (CP/TF). Although these functions are separable, with bounded complexity and uniformly scaled sub-function contributions, the hierarchical Bayesian Optimization Algorithm (hBOA) scales exponentially on both. We argue that test problems containing parity functions are hard for EDAs because there are no interactions in the contribution to fitness between any strict subset of a parity function's bits. This means that as population sizes increase the dependency between variable values for any strict subset of a parity function's bits decreases. Unfortunately most EDAs including hBOA search for their models by looking for dependencies between pairs of variables (at least at first). We make suggestions on how EDAs could be adjusted to handle parity problems, but also comment on the apparently inevitable computational cost.",

Genetic algorithms, the most well-known and representative evolutionary search technique, have been the subject of the major part of such applications. Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) offer a novel evolutionary paradigm that constitutes a natural and attractive alternative to genetic algorithms. They make use of a probabilistic model, learnt from the promising solutions, to guide the search process. In this paper, we set out a basic taxonomy of EDA techniques, underlining the nature and complexity of the probabilistic model of each EDA variant.

The polynomial distribution is applied by discrete EDAs and continuous EDAs based on discretization of the domain such as histogram-based EDA. We can unify those kinds of EDA from their distribution and call them PolyEDA. In this paper, we theoretically analyze PolyEDA from a Bayesian analysis view. Our analysis is based on the assumption that the prior distribution of the parameters satisfies a Dirichlet Distribution, because under this assumption the formulation can be analytically solved. Furthermore, we notice that the prior distribution is always overlooked by previous algorithms, so we follow this way and propose some strategies to improve the PolyEDA. The experimental results show that these new strategies can help the polynomial model based estimation of distribution algorithms achieve better convergence and diversity.",

In this chapter we adapt the EDA approach for use in optimizing problems with tree representations and thereby attempt to expand the boundaries of successful evolutionary algorithms. To do so, we propose a probability distribution for the space of trees, based on a grammar.

State-of-the-art EDAs like the Hierarchical Bayesian Optimization Algorithm (hBOA), the Learning Factorized Distribution Algorithm (LFDA) or Estimation of Bayesian Networks Algorithm (EBNA) solve these problems in polynomial time. Regarding this success, it is tempting to apply EDAs to real-world problems. But up to now, it has rarely been analyzed which real-world problems are decomposable. The main contribution of this chapter is twofold: (1) It shows that uncapacitated single-product and multi-product lotsizing problems are decomposable. (2) A state-of-the-art EDA is used to solve both problems. The problems are fundamental in inventory management and their fitness functions can be expressed as additively decomposable functions. It is analyzed how a search distribution of Boltzmann-type factorizes for these functions and it is shown that the factorizations of the Boltzmann distribution are polynomially bounded. Consequently, experimental scalability analysis is conducted for both problems with a state-of-the-art EDA. The total number of fitness evaluations required to reliably solve the problems to optimality is found to grow with a low-order polynomial depending on the problem size. The results confirm existing scalability theory for decomposable problems.",

One powerful method to address those difficult problems is the nested partitions method (NP). This method, however, cannot use historical information because it is required that the sampling of different iterations should be independent in order to guarantee global convergence. In this paper, the convergence property of the NIP method is enhanced by relaxing the independent sampling requirement with a much milder one so that historical information can be utilized without impairing algorithm convergence. Novel insights about how to effectively utilize historical information are obtained by representing the NIP method in the viewpoint of the estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs).

They have the ability to uncover the hidden regularities of problems and then exploit them for effective search. Real-coded Bayesian optimization algorithm (rBOA) which brings the power of discrete BOA to bear upon the continuous domain has been regarded as a milestone in the field of numerical optimization. It has been empirically observed that the rBOA solves, with subquadratic scaleup behavior, numerical optimization problems of bounded difficulty. This underlines the scalability of rBOA (at least) in practice. However, there is no firm theoretical basis for this scalability.|The aim of this paper is to carry out a theoretical analysis of the scalability of rBOA in the context of additively decomposable problems with real-valued variables. The scalability is measured by the growth of the number of fitness function evaluations (in order to reach the optimum) with the size of the problem. The total number of evaluations is computed by multiplying the population size for learning a correct probabilistic model (i.e., population complexity) and the number of generations before convergence, (i.e., convergence time complexity). Experimental results support the scalability model of rBOA. The rBOA shows a subquadratic (in problem size) scalability for uniformly scaled decomposable problems.",

        "description": "Efficiency enhancement techniques - such as parallelization and hybridization - are among the most important ingredients of practical applications of genetic and evolutionary algorithms and that is why this research area represents an important niche of evolutionary computation. This paper describes and analyzes sporadic model building, which can be used to enhance the efficiency of the hierarchical Bayesian optimization algorithm (hBOA) and other estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) that use complex multivariate probabilistic models. With sporadic model building, the structure of the probabilistic model is updated once in every few iterations (generations), whereas in the remaining iterations, only model parameters (conditional and marginal probabilities) are updated. Since the time complexity of updating model parameters is much lower than the time complexity of learning the model structure, sporadic model building decreases the overall time complexity of model building. The paper shows that for boundedly difficult nearly decomposable and hierarchical optimization problems, sporadic model building leads to a significant model-building speedup, which decreases the asymptotic time complexity of model building in hBOA by a factor of Theta(n(0.26)) to Theta(n(0.5)) where n is the problem size. On the other hand, sporadic model building also increases the number of evaluations until convergence; nonetheless, if model building is the bottleneck, the evaluation slowdown is insignificant compared to the gains in the asymptotic complexity of model building. The paper also presents a dimensional model to provide a heuristic for scaling the structure-building period, which is the only parameter of the proposed sporadic model-building approach. The paper then tests the proposed method and the rule for setting the structure-building period on the problem of finding ground states of 2D and 3D Ising spin glasses.",

By eliminating the traditionally employed genetic operators, these probabilistic EAs have been forced to adopt an alternative approach, and in the case of Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs), probabilistic graphical models have become the favored substitute. In this paper, we propose to utilize a previously overlooked probabilistic model known as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). But preferring not to completely abandon the biologically inspired genetic operations, we largely ignore the classical learning algorithms used to train HMMs, and instead use Differential Evolution (DE) to evolve the underlying numerical parameters of the chosen probabilistic model. The evolved HMMs are then used to generate Prefix Gene Expression Programming (PGEP) chromosomes which encode candidate solutions, and thus provide feedback to guide this proposed evolutionary search process. Finally, benchmarking on a set of symbolic function regression problems has been conducted in order to compare this novel approach to the existing PGEP method.",

Amongst others, it is successfully used in most state-of-the-art Go programs. To improve the playing strength of these Go programs any further, many parameters dealing with MCTS Should be fine-tuned.|In this paper, we propose to apply the Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) for this task. The method is comparable to Estimation-of-Distribution Algorithms (EDAs), a new area of evolutionary computation. We tested CEM by tuning various types of parameters in our Go program MANGO. The experiments were performed in matches against the open-source program GNU Go. They revealed that a program with the CEM tuned parameters played better than without. Moreover, MANGO plus CEM outperformed the regular MANGO for various time settings and board sizes. From the results we may conclude that parameter tuning by CEM genuinely improved the playing strength of MANGO, for various time settings. This result may be generalized to other game engines using MCTS.",

        "authors": "Dong, WS and Yao, X",
        "description": "Since the Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) have been introduced, several single model based EDAs and mixture model based EDAs have been developed. Take Gaussian models as an example, EDAs based on single Gaussian distribution have good performance on solving simple unimodal functions and multimodal functions whose landscape has an obvious trend towards the global optimum. But they have difficulties in solving multimodal functions with irregular landscapes, such as wide basins, flat plateaus and deep valleys. Gaussian mixture model based EDAs have been developed to remedy this disadvantage of single Gaussian based EDAs. A general framework NichingEDA is presented in this paper from a new perspective to boost single model based EDAs' performance. Through adopting a niching method and recombination operators in a population of EDAs, NichingEDA significantly boosts the traditional single model based EDAs' performance by making use of the diversity inside the EDA population on hard problems without estimating a precise distribution. Our experimental studies have shown that NichingEDA is very effective for some hard global optimization problems, although its scalability to high dimensional functions needs improving. Analyses and discussions are presented to explain why NichingEDA performed well/poorly on certain benchmark functions.",

On the one hand, it is presented in Sect. 10.1 a new family of cellular GAs in which a hierarchy is established inside the population such that better individuals are moved to the same region of the grid. This way, a faster convergence of the best individuals is promoted, while the diversity is maintained in locations far away from this region. This new hierarchical cellular model is applied here to GAs, but it can be implemented in any other family of EA. It can be helpful in parallel implementations looking for fail tolerance, since some parts of the population could be lost with negligible effects on the search. Also, faster convergence can be an interesting outcome of this new mode.|On the other hand, a new class of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) is addressed in Sect. 10.2. This new family of algorithms is known as cellular EDAs (cEDAs), and they are characterized by their decentralized population, which is partitioned into many small collaborating sub-populations, arranged in a toroidal grid, and interacting only with its neighboring sub-populations.|These two new families of cellular models are analyzed and compared in this chapter against their equivalent panmictic algorithms from the points of view of both theory and practice.",

In spite of its simplicity, logistic regression has shown very good performance in a range of fields. It is widely accepted in a range of fields because its results are easy to interpret. Fitting the logistic regression model usually involves using the principle of maximum likelihood. The Newton-Raphson algorithm is the most common numerical approach for obtaining the coefficients maximizing the likelihood of the data.|This work presents a novel approach for fitting the logistic regression model based on estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), a tool for evolutionary computation. EDAs are suitable not only for maximizing the likelihood, but also for maximizing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).|Thus, we tackle the logistic regression problem from a double perspective: likelihood-based to calibrate the model and AUC-based to discriminate between the different classes. Under these two objectives of calibration and discrimination, the Pareto front can be obtained in our EDA framework. These fronts are compared with those yielded by a multiobjective EDA recently introduced in the literature.",

We then show how multi-variate EDAs linkage learning mechanisms can be misled with the help of two test problems; the concatenated parity function (CPF), and the concatenated parity/trapfunction (CP/TF). Although these functions are separable, with bounded complexity and uniformly scaled sub-function contributions, the hierarchical Bayesian Optimization Algorithm (hBOA) scales exponentially on both. We argue that test problems containing parity functions are hard for EDAs because there are no interactions in the contribution to fitness between any strict subset of a parity function's bits. This means that as population sizes increase the dependency between variable values for any strict subset of a parity function's bits decreases. Unfortunately most EDAs including hBOA search for their models by looking for dependencies between pairs of variables (at least at first). We make suggestions on how EDAs could be adjusted to handle parity problems, but also comment on the apparently inevitable computational cost.",

We can unify those kinds of EDA from their distribution and call them PolyEDA. In this paper, we theoretically analyze PolyEDA from a Bayesian analysis view. Our analysis is based on the assumption that the prior distribution of the parameters satisfies a Dirichlet Distribution, because under this assumption the formulation can be analytically solved. Furthermore, we notice that the prior distribution is always overlooked by previous algorithms, so we follow this way and propose some strategies to improve the PolyEDA. The experimental results show that these new strategies can help the polynomial model based estimation of distribution algorithms achieve better convergence and diversity.",

Regarding this success, it is tempting to apply EDAs to real-world problems. But up to now, it has rarely been analyzed which real-world problems are decomposable. The main contribution of this chapter is twofold: (1) It shows that uncapacitated single-product and multi-product lotsizing problems are decomposable. (2) A state-of-the-art EDA is used to solve both problems. The problems are fundamental in inventory management and their fitness functions can be expressed as additively decomposable functions. It is analyzed how a search distribution of Boltzmann-type factorizes for these functions and it is shown that the factorizations of the Boltzmann distribution are polynomially bounded. Consequently, experimental scalability analysis is conducted for both problems with a state-of-the-art EDA. The total number of fitness evaluations required to reliably solve the problems to optimality is found to grow with a low-order polynomial depending on the problem size. The results confirm existing scalability theory for decomposable problems.",

In this paper, the convergence property of the NIP method is enhanced by relaxing the independent sampling requirement with a much milder one so that historical information can be utilized without impairing algorithm convergence. Novel insights about how to effectively utilize historical information are obtained by representing the NIP method in the viewpoint of the estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs).

They have the ability to uncover the hidden regularities of problems and then exploit them for effective search. Real-coded Bayesian optimization algorithm (rBOA) which brings the power of discrete BOA to bear upon the continuous domain has been regarded as a milestone in the field of numerical optimization. It has been empirically observed that the rBOA solves, with subquadratic scaleup behavior, numerical optimization problems of bounded difficulty. This underlines the scalability of rBOA (at least) in practice. However, there is no firm theoretical basis for this scalability.|The aim of this paper is to carry out a theoretical analysis of the scalability of rBOA in the context of additively decomposable problems with real-valued variables. The scalability is measured by the growth of the number of fitness function evaluations (in order to reach the optimum) with the size of the problem. The total number of evaluations is computed by multiplying the population size for learning a correct probabilistic model (i.e., population complexity) and the number of generations before convergence, (i.e., convergence time complexity). Experimental results support the scalability model of rBOA. The rBOA shows a subquadratic (in problem size) scalability for uniformly scaled decomposable problems.",

        "description": "Efficiency enhancement techniques - such as parallelization and hybridization - are among the most important ingredients of practical applications of genetic and evolutionary algorithms and that is why this research area represents an important niche of evolutionary computation. This paper describes and analyzes sporadic model building, which can be used to enhance the efficiency of the hierarchical Bayesian optimization algorithm (hBOA) and other estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) that use complex multivariate probabilistic models. With sporadic model building, the structure of the probabilistic model is updated once in every few iterations (generations), whereas in the remaining iterations, only model parameters (conditional and marginal probabilities) are updated. Since the time complexity of updating model parameters is much lower than the time complexity of learning the model structure, sporadic model building decreases the overall time complexity of model building. The paper shows that for boundedly difficult nearly decomposable and hierarchical optimization problems, sporadic model building leads to a significant model-building speedup, which decreases the asymptotic time complexity of model building in hBOA by a factor of Theta(n(0.26)) to Theta(n(0.5)) where n is the problem size. On the other hand, sporadic model building also increases the number of evaluations until convergence; nonetheless, if model building is the bottleneck, the evaluation slowdown is insignificant compared to the gains in the asymptotic complexity of model building. The paper also presents a dimensional model to provide a heuristic for scaling the structure-building period, which is the only parameter of the proposed sporadic model-building approach. The paper then tests the proposed method and the rule for setting the structure-building period on the problem of finding ground states of 2D and 3D Ising spin glasses.",

The simplest method for preventing premature convergence of Gaussian distribution is enlarging the maximum likelihood estimate of a by a constant factor k each generation. Such a factor should be large enough to prevent convergence on slopes of the fitness function, but should not be too large to allow the algorithm converge in the neighborhood of the optimum.

First, we analyze the question of whether learning more accurate (exact) models of the dependencies implies a better performance of EDAs. Secondly, we are able to study the way in which the problem structure is translated into the probabilistic model when exact learning is accomplished. The results obtained reveal that the quality of the problem information captured by the probability model can improve when the accuracy of the learning algorithm employed is increased.

However, this property has not been utilized in the decision space. Using the regularity property in both the objective and decision space, this paper proposes a simple EDA for multiobjective optimization. Since the location information has not efficiently used in EDAs, a combination of EDA and differential evolution (DE) is suggested for improving the algorithmic performance.

By eliminating the traditionally employed genetic operators, these probabilistic EAs have been forced to adopt an alternative approach, and in the case of Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs), probabilistic graphical models have become the favored substitute. In this paper, we propose to utilize a previously overlooked probabilistic model known as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). But preferring not to completely abandon the biologically inspired genetic operations, we largely ignore the classical learning algorithms used to train HMMs, and instead use Differential Evolution (DE) to evolve the underlying numerical parameters of the chosen probabilistic model. The evolved HMMs are then used to generate Prefix Gene Expression Programming (PGEP) chromosomes which encode candidate solutions, and thus provide feedback to guide this proposed evolutionary search process. Finally, benchmarking on a set of symbolic function regression problems has been conducted in order to compare this novel approach to the existing PGEP method.",

PEA is inspired by estimation of distribution algorithms and quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm, and it has a good balance between exploration and exploitation with very fast computation speed. The individual in PEA is encoded by the probability vector, defined as the smallest unit of information, for the probabilistic representation. The observation step is used in PEA to obtain the observed states of the individual, and the update operator is used to evolve the individual. In the PEA based human tracking framework, tracking is considered to be a function optimization problem, so the aim is to optimize the matching function between the model and the image observation. Since the matching function is a very complex function in high-dimensional space, PEA is used to optimize it. Experiments on 2D and 3D human motion tracking demonstrate the effectiveness, significance and computation efficiency of the proposed human tracking method. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The method is comparable to Estimation-of-Distribution Algorithms (EDAs), a new area of evolutionary computation. We tested CEM by tuning various types of parameters in our Go program MANGO. The experiments were performed in matches against the open-source program GNU Go. They revealed that a program with the CEM tuned parameters played better than without. Moreover, MANGO plus CEM outperformed the regular MANGO for various time settings and board sizes. From the results we may conclude that parameter tuning by CEM genuinely improved the playing strength of MANGO, for various time settings. This result may be generalized to other game engines using MCTS.",

        "description": "Since the Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) have been introduced, several single model based EDAs and mixture model based EDAs have been developed. Take Gaussian models as an example, EDAs based on single Gaussian distribution have good performance on solving simple unimodal functions and multimodal functions whose landscape has an obvious trend towards the global optimum. But they have difficulties in solving multimodal functions with irregular landscapes, such as wide basins, flat plateaus and deep valleys. Gaussian mixture model based EDAs have been developed to remedy this disadvantage of single Gaussian based EDAs. A general framework NichingEDA is presented in this paper from a new perspective to boost single model based EDAs' performance. Through adopting a niching method and recombination operators in a population of EDAs, NichingEDA significantly boosts the traditional single model based EDAs' performance by making use of the diversity inside the EDA population on hard problems without estimating a precise distribution. Our experimental studies have shown that NichingEDA is very effective for some hard global optimization problems, although its scalability to high dimensional functions needs improving. Analyses and discussions are presented to explain why NichingEDA performed well/poorly on certain benchmark functions.",

This way, a faster convergence of the best individuals is promoted, while the diversity is maintained in locations far away from this region. This new hierarchical cellular model is applied here to GAs, but it can be implemented in any other family of EA. It can be helpful in parallel implementations looking for fail tolerance, since some parts of the population could be lost with negligible effects on the search. Also, faster convergence can be an interesting outcome of this new mode.|On the other hand, a new class of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) is addressed in Sect. 10.2. This new family of algorithms is known as cellular EDAs (cEDAs), and they are characterized by their decentralized population, which is partitioned into many small collaborating sub-populations, arranged in a toroidal grid, and interacting only with its neighboring sub-populations.|These two new families of cellular models are analyzed and compared in this chapter against their equivalent panmictic algorithms from the points of view of both theory and practice.",

Although these functions are separable, with bounded complexity and uniformly scaled sub-function contributions, the hierarchical Bayesian Optimization Algorithm (hBOA) scales exponentially on both. We argue that test problems containing parity functions are hard for EDAs because there are no interactions in the contribution to fitness between any strict subset of a parity function's bits. This means that as population sizes increase the dependency between variable values for any strict subset of a parity function's bits decreases. Unfortunately most EDAs including hBOA search for their models by looking for dependencies between pairs of variables (at least at first).

We can unify those kinds of EDA from their distribution and call them PolyEDA. In this paper, we theoretically analyze PolyEDA from a Bayesian analysis view. Our analysis is based on the assumption that the prior distribution of the parameters satisfies a Dirichlet Distribution, because under this assumption the formulation can be analytically solved. Furthermore, we notice that the prior distribution is always overlooked by previous algorithms, so we follow this way and propose some strategies to improve the PolyEDA.

Although each of these metaheuristics has been previously hybridized in several ways, this paper constitutes the first attempt to combine both optimization methods.|The different ways of combining VNS and EDAs will be classified into three groups. In the first group, we will consider combinations where the philosophy underlying VNS is embedded in EDAs. Considering different neighborhood spaces (points, populations or probability distributions), we will obtain instantiations for the approaches in this group. The second group of algorithms is obtained when probabilistic models (or any other machine learning paradigm) are used in order to exploit the good and bad shakes of the randomly generated solutions in a reduced variable neighborhood search. The last group of algorithms contains the results of alternating VNS and EDAs.|An application of the first approach is presented in the protein side chain placement problem. The results obtained show the superiority of the hybrid algorithm in comparison with EDAs and VNS.",

        "description": "In existing theoretical and experimental work, Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) are primarily applied to decomposable test problems. State-of-the-art EDAs like the Hierarchical Bayesian Optimization Algorithm (hBOA), the Learning Factorized Distribution Algorithm (LFDA) or Estimation of Bayesian Networks Algorithm (EBNA) solve these problems in polynomial time. Regarding this success, it is tempting to apply EDAs to real-world problems. But up to now, it has rarely been analyzed which real-world problems are decomposable. The main contribution of this chapter is twofold: (1) It shows that uncapacitated single-product and multi-product lotsizing problems are decomposable. (2) A state-of-the-art EDA is used to solve both problems. The problems are fundamental in inventory management and their fitness functions can be expressed as additively decomposable functions. It is analyzed how a search distribution of Boltzmann-type factorizes for these functions and it is shown that the factorizations of the Boltzmann distribution are polynomially bounded. Consequently, experimental scalability analysis is conducted for both problems with a state-of-the-art EDA. The total number of fitness evaluations required to reliably solve the problems to optimality is found to grow with a low-order polynomial depending on the problem size. The results confirm existing scalability theory for decomposable problems.",

One powerful method to address those difficult problems is the nested partitions method (NP). This method, however, cannot use historical information because it is required that the sampling of different iterations should be independent in order to guarantee global convergence. In this paper, the convergence property of the NIP method is enhanced by relaxing the independent sampling requirement with a much milder one so that historical information can be utilized without impairing algorithm convergence. Novel insights about how to effectively utilize historical information are obtained by representing the NIP method in the viewpoint of the estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). The convergence result of the enhanced NP method is further extended to derive global convergence for a large class of population-based methods, population distribution-based methods.",

Their various mechanisms make it difficult to analyze and compare these methods and to extend the advancement in one method to another. To this end, a unified optimization framework towards representing these seemingly different methods is established as iteratively sampling and updating of a population distribution.

They have the ability to uncover the hidden regularities of problems and then exploit them for effective search. Real-coded Bayesian optimization algorithm (rBOA) which brings the power of discrete BOA to bear upon the continuous domain has been regarded as a milestone in the field of numerical optimization. It has been empirically observed that the rBOA solves, with subquadratic scaleup behavior, numerical optimization problems of bounded difficulty. This underlines the scalability of rBOA (at least) in practice. However, there is no firm theoretical basis for this scalability.|The aim of this paper is to carry out a theoretical analysis of the scalability of rBOA in the context of additively decomposable problems with real-valued variables. The scalability is measured by the growth of the number of fitness function evaluations (in order to reach the optimum) with the size of the problem. The total number of evaluations is computed by multiplying the population size for learning a correct probabilistic model (i.e., population complexity) and the number of generations before convergence, (i.e., convergence time complexity). Experimental results support the scalability model of rBOA. The rBOA shows a subquadratic (in problem size) scalability for uniformly scaled decomposable problems.",

        "description": "Efficiency enhancement techniques - such as parallelization and hybridization - are among the most important ingredients of practical applications of genetic and evolutionary algorithms and that is why this research area represents an important niche of evolutionary computation. This paper describes and analyzes sporadic model building, which can be used to enhance the efficiency of the hierarchical Bayesian optimization algorithm (hBOA) and other estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) that use complex multivariate probabilistic models. With sporadic model building, the structure of the probabilistic model is updated once in every few iterations (generations), whereas in the remaining iterations, only model parameters (conditional and marginal probabilities) are updated. Since the time complexity of updating model parameters is much lower than the time complexity of learning the model structure, sporadic model building decreases the overall time complexity of model building. The paper shows that for boundedly difficult nearly decomposable and hierarchical optimization problems, sporadic model building leads to a significant model-building speedup, which decreases the asymptotic time complexity of model building in hBOA by a factor of Theta(n(0.26)) to Theta(n(0.5)) where n is the problem size. On the other hand, sporadic model building also increases the number of evaluations until convergence; nonetheless, if model building is the bottleneck, the evaluation slowdown is insignificant compared to the gains in the asymptotic complexity of model building. The paper also presents a dimensional model to provide a heuristic for scaling the structure-building period, which is the only parameter of the proposed sporadic model-building approach. The paper then tests the proposed method and the rule for setting the structure-building period on the problem of finding ground states of 2D and 3D Ising spin glasses.",

Such a factor should be large enough to prevent convergence on slopes of the fitness function, but should not be too large to allow the algorithm converge in the neighborhood of the optimum.

Secondly, we are able to study the way in which the problem structure is translated into the probabilistic model when exact learning is accomplished.

By eliminating the traditionally employed genetic operators, these probabilistic EAs have been forced to adopt an alternative approach, and in the case of Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs), probabilistic graphical models have become the favored substitute. In this paper, we propose to utilize a previously overlooked probabilistic model known as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). But preferring not to completely abandon the biologically inspired genetic operations, we largely ignore the classical learning algorithms used to train HMMs, and instead use Differential Evolution (DE) to evolve the underlying numerical parameters of the chosen probabilistic model. The evolved HMMs are then used to generate Prefix Gene Expression Programming (PGEP) chromosomes which encode candidate solutions, and thus provide feedback to guide this proposed evolutionary search process. Finally, benchmarking on a set of symbolic function regression problems has been conducted in order to compare this novel approach to the existing PGEP method.",

Take Gaussian models as an example, EDAs based on single Gaussian distribution have good performance on solving simple unimodal functions and multimodal functions whose landscape has an obvious trend towards the global optimum. But they have difficulties in solving multimodal functions with irregular landscapes, such as wide basins, flat plateaus and deep valleys. Gaussian mixture model based EDAs have been developed to remedy this disadvantage of single Gaussian based EDAs. A general framework NichingEDA is presented in this paper from a new perspective to boost single model based EDAs' performance. Through adopting a niching method and recombination operators in a population of EDAs, NichingEDA significantly boosts the traditional single model based EDAs' performance by making use of the diversity inside the EDA population on hard problems without estimating a precise distribution. Our experimental studies have shown that NichingEDA is very effective for some hard global optimization problems, although its scalability to high dimensional functions needs improving. Analyses and discussions are presented to explain why NichingEDA performed well/poorly on certain benchmark functions.",

This new hierarchical cellular model is applied here to GAs, but it can be implemented in any other family of EA.

We show that without careful interpretation and adaptation of lessons learned from discrete EDAs, continuous EDAs will fail to perform efficient optimization on even some of the simplest problems. We reconsider the most important lessons to be learned in the design of EDAs and subsequently show how we can use this knowledge to extend continuous EDAs that were obtained by straightforward adaptation from the discrete domain so as to obtain an improvement in performance.

In spite of its simplicity, logistic regression has shown very good performance in a range of fields. It is widely accepted in a range of fields because its results are easy to interpret. Fitting the logistic regression model usually involves using the principle of maximum likelihood. The Newton-Raphson algorithm is the most common numerical approach for obtaining the coefficients maximizing the likelihood of the data.|This work presents a novel approach for fitting the logistic regression model based on estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), a tool for evolutionary computation. EDAs are suitable not only for maximizing the likelihood, but also for maximizing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).|Thus, we tackle the logistic regression problem from a double perspective: likelihood-based to calibrate the model and AUC-based to discriminate between the different classes. Under these two objectives of calibration and discrimination, the Pareto front can be obtained in our EDA framework. These fronts are compared with those yielded by a multiobjective EDA recently introduced in the literature.",

We then show how multi-variate EDAs linkage learning mechanisms can be misled with the help of two test problems; the concatenated parity function (CPF), and the concatenated parity/trapfunction (CP/TF). Although these functions are separable, with bounded complexity and uniformly scaled sub-function contributions, the hierarchical Bayesian Optimization Algorithm (hBOA) scales exponentially on both. We argue that test problems containing parity functions are hard for EDAs because there are no interactions in the contribution to fitness between any strict subset of a parity function's bits. This means that as population sizes increase the dependency between variable values for any strict subset of a parity function's bits decreases. Unfortunately most EDAs including hBOA search for their models by looking for dependencies between pairs of variables (at least at first). We make suggestions on how EDAs could be adjusted to handle parity problems, but also comment on the apparently inevitable computational cost.",

We can unify those kinds of EDA from their distribution and call them PolyEDA. In this paper, we theoretically analyze PolyEDA from a Bayesian analysis view. Our analysis is based on the assumption that the prior distribution of the parameters satisfies a Dirichlet Distribution, because under this assumption the formulation can be analytically solved. Furthermore, we notice that the prior distribution is always overlooked by previous algorithms, so we follow this way and propose some strategies to improve the PolyEDA. The experimental results show that these new strategies can help the polynomial model based estimation of distribution algorithms achieve better convergence and diversity.",

State-of-the-art EDAs like the Hierarchical Bayesian Optimization Algorithm (hBOA), the Learning Factorized Distribution Algorithm (LFDA) or Estimation of Bayesian Networks Algorithm (EBNA) solve these problems in polynomial time. Regarding this success, it is tempting to apply EDAs to real-world problems. But up to now, it has rarely been analyzed which real-world problems are decomposable. The main contribution of this chapter is twofold: (1) It shows that uncapacitated single-product and multi-product lotsizing problems are decomposable. (2) A state-of-the-art EDA is used to solve both problems. The problems are fundamental in inventory management and their fitness functions can be expressed as additively decomposable functions. It is analyzed how a search distribution of Boltzmann-type factorizes for these functions and it is shown that the factorizations of the Boltzmann distribution are polynomially bounded. Consequently, experimental scalability analysis is conducted for both problems with a state-of-the-art EDA. The total number of fitness evaluations required to reliably solve the problems to optimality is found to grow with a low-order polynomial depending on the problem size. The results confirm existing scalability theory for decomposable problems.",

In this paper, the convergence property of the NIP method is enhanced by relaxing the independent sampling requirement with a much milder one so that historical information can be utilized without impairing algorithm convergence. Novel insights about how to effectively utilize historical information are obtained by representing the NIP method in the viewpoint of the estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs).

They have the ability to uncover the hidden regularities of problems and then exploit them for effective search. Real-coded Bayesian optimization algorithm (rBOA) which brings the power of discrete BOA to bear upon the continuous domain has been regarded as a milestone in the field of numerical optimization. It has been empirically observed that the rBOA solves, with subquadratic scaleup behavior, numerical optimization problems of bounded difficulty. This underlines the scalability of rBOA (at least) in practice. However, there is no firm theoretical basis for this scalability.|The aim of this paper is to carry out a theoretical analysis of the scalability of rBOA in the context of additively decomposable problems with real-valued variables. The scalability is measured by the growth of the number of fitness function evaluations (in order to reach the optimum) with the size of the problem. The total number of evaluations is computed by multiplying the population size for learning a correct probabilistic model (i.e., population complexity) and the number of generations before convergence, (i.e., convergence time complexity). Experimental results support the scalability model of rBOA. The rBOA shows a subquadratic (in problem size) scalability for uniformly scaled decomposable problems.",

        "description": "Efficiency enhancement techniques - such as parallelization and hybridization - are among the most important ingredients of practical applications of genetic and evolutionary algorithms and that is why this research area represents an important niche of evolutionary computation. This paper describes and analyzes sporadic model building, which can be used to enhance the efficiency of the hierarchical Bayesian optimization algorithm (hBOA) and other estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) that use complex multivariate probabilistic models. With sporadic model building, the structure of the probabilistic model is updated once in every few iterations (generations), whereas in the remaining iterations, only model parameters (conditional and marginal probabilities) are updated. Since the time complexity of updating model parameters is much lower than the time complexity of learning the model structure, sporadic model building decreases the overall time complexity of model building. The paper shows that for boundedly difficult nearly decomposable and hierarchical optimization problems, sporadic model building leads to a significant model-building speedup, which decreases the asymptotic time complexity of model building in hBOA by a factor of Theta(n(0.26)) to Theta(n(0.5)) where n is the problem size. On the other hand, sporadic model building also increases the number of evaluations until convergence; nonetheless, if model building is the bottleneck, the evaluation slowdown is insignificant compared to the gains in the asymptotic complexity of model building. The paper also presents a dimensional model to provide a heuristic for scaling the structure-building period, which is the only parameter of the proposed sporadic model-building approach. The paper then tests the proposed method and the rule for setting the structure-building period on the problem of finding ground states of 2D and 3D Ising spin glasses.",

        "description": "In this paper, we propose the incorporation of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based supervised and unsupervised Machine Learning techniques into the evolutionary search, in order to detect strongly connected variables. The cost of extending a search method with an ANN based learning skill is relatively low, the memory requirements and model building cost being at most linearithmic in the number of variables.|As a case study, we show how these mechanisms can enable the simple (1+1) Evolutionary Algorithm to efficiently solve hard problems, which are provably intractable using just fixed representation and problem independent operators. Furthermore, simulation results show, that on test suites characterized by strong variable coupling, the ANN extended (1+1) Evolutionary Algorithm qualitatively outperform the best known, full-featured, population based Estimation of Distribution Algorithms.",

        "authors": "Echegoyen, C, Santana, R, Larra\u00f1aga, P",
        "description": "This paper discusses exact learning of Bayesian networks in estimation of distribution algorithms. The estimation of Bayesian network algorithm (EBNA) is used to analyze the impact of learning the optimal (exact) structure in the search. By applying recently introduced methods that allow learning optimal Bayesian networks, we investigate two important issues in EDAs. First, we analyze the question of whether learning more accurate (exact) models of the dependencies implies a better performance of EDAs. Secondly, we are able to study the way in which the problem structure is translated into the probabilistic model when exact learning is accomplished. The results obtained reveal that the quality of the problem information captured by the probability model can improve when the accuracy of the learning algorithm employed is increased. However, improvements in model accuracy do not always imply a more efficient search.",

        "description": "The Pareto front (Pareto set) of a continuous optimization problem with m objectives is a (m - 1) dimensional piecewise continuous manifold in the objective space (the decision space) under some mild conditions. Based on this regularity property in the objective space, we have recently developed several multiobjective estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). However, this property has not been utilized in the decision space. Using the regularity property in both the objective and decision space, this paper proposes a simple EDA for multiobjective optimization. Since the location information has not efficiently used in EDAs, a combination of EDA and differential evolution (DE) is suggested for improving the algorithmic performance. The hybrid method and the pure EDA method proposed in this paper, and a DE based method are compared on several test instances. Experimental results have shown that the algorithm with the proposed strategy is very promising.",

        "description": "Over the years there has been an increasing interest in probabilistically oriented Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), but it has not been until recently that these innovative methods have been collectively recognized and achieved an independent status. By eliminating the traditionally employed genetic operators, these probabilistic EAs have been forced to adopt an alternative approach, and in the case of Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs), probabilistic graphical models have become the favored substitute. In this paper, we propose to utilize a previously overlooked probabilistic model known as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). But preferring not to completely abandon the biologically inspired genetic operations, we largely ignore the classical learning algorithms used to train HMMs, and instead use Differential Evolution (DE) to evolve the underlying numerical parameters of the chosen probabilistic model. The evolved HMMs are then used to generate Prefix Gene Expression Programming (PGEP) chromosomes which encode candidate solutions, and thus provide feedback to guide this proposed evolutionary search process. Finally, benchmarking on a set of symbolic function regression problems has been conducted in order to compare this novel approach to the existing PGEP method.",

        "description": "A novel evolutionary algorithm called probability evolutionary algorithm (PEA), and a method based on PEA for visual tracking of human motion are presented. PEA is inspired by estimation of distribution algorithms and quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm, and it has a good balance between exploration and exploitation with very fast computation speed. The individual in PEA is encoded by the probability vector, defined as the smallest unit of information, for the probabilistic representation. The observation step is used in PEA to obtain the observed states of the individual, and the update operator is used to evolve the individual. In the PEA based human tracking framework, tracking is considered to be a function optimization problem, so the aim is to optimize the matching function between the model and the image observation. Since the matching function is a very complex function in high-dimensional space, PEA is used to optimize it. Experiments on 2D and 3D human motion tracking demonstrate the effectiveness, significance and computation efficiency of the proposed human tracking method. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

        "description": "Recently, Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) has become a Popular approach for intelligent play in games. Amongst others, it is successfully used in most state-of-the-art Go programs. To improve the playing strength of these Go programs any further, many parameters dealing with MCTS Should be fine-tuned.|In this paper, we propose to apply the Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) for this task. The method is comparable to Estimation-of-Distribution Algorithms (EDAs), a new area of evolutionary computation. We tested CEM by tuning various types of parameters in our Go program MANGO. The experiments were performed in matches against the open-source program GNU Go. They revealed that a program with the CEM tuned parameters played better than without. Moreover, MANGO plus CEM outperformed the regular MANGO for various time settings and board sizes. From the results we may conclude that parameter tuning by CEM genuinely improved the playing strength of MANGO, for various time settings. This result may be generalized to other game engines using MCTS.",

        "authors": "Dong, WS and Yao, X",
        "description": "Since the Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) have been introduced, several single model based EDAs and mixture model based EDAs have been developed. Take Gaussian models as an example, EDAs based on single Gaussian distribution have good performance on solving simple unimodal functions and multimodal functions whose landscape has an obvious trend towards the global optimum. But they have difficulties in solving multimodal functions with irregular landscapes, such as wide basins, flat plateaus and deep valleys. Gaussian mixture model based EDAs have been developed to remedy this disadvantage of single Gaussian based EDAs. A general framework NichingEDA is presented in this paper from a new perspective to boost single model based EDAs' performance. Through adopting a niching method and recombination operators in a population of EDAs, NichingEDA significantly boosts the traditional single model based EDAs' performance by making use of the diversity inside the EDA population on hard problems without estimating a precise distribution. Our experimental studies have shown that NichingEDA is very effective for some hard global optimization problems, although its scalability to high dimensional functions needs improving. Analyses and discussions are presented to explain why NichingEDA performed well/poorly on certain benchmark functions.",

        "description": "After proposing so many cellular models in the previous chapters, we now proceed in this chapter to complete this extensive study by compiling some other interesting cellular models recently proposed in the literature.|Specifically, we consider two new families of cellular EAs. On the one hand, it is presented in Sect. 10.1 a new family of cellular GAs in which a hierarchy is established inside the population such that better individuals are moved to the same region of the grid. This way, a faster convergence of the best individuals is promoted, while the diversity is maintained in locations far away from this region. This new hierarchical cellular model is applied here to GAs, but it can be implemented in any other family of EA. It can be helpful in parallel implementations looking for fail tolerance, since some parts of the population could be lost with negligible effects on the search. Also, faster convergence can be an interesting outcome of this new mode.|On the other hand, a new class of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) is addressed in Sect. 10.2. This new family of algorithms is known as cellular EDAs (cEDAs), and they are characterized by their decentralized population, which is partitioned into many small collaborating sub-populations, arranged in a toroidal grid, and interacting only with its neighboring sub-populations.|These two new families of cellular models are analyzed and compared in this chapter against their equivalent panmictic algorithms from the points of view of both theory and practice.",
