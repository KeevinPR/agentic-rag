Subspace estimation of distribution algorithms: To perturb part of all variables in estimation of distribution algorithms,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000287479200004,"Li, HL, Hong, Y and Kwong, S","In the traditional estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), all the variables of candidate individuals are perturbed through sampling from a probability distribution of promising individuals. However, it may be unnecessary for the EDAs to perturb all variables of candidate individuals at each generation. This is because one variable may be dependent on another variable and all variables may have different saliences even if they are independent. Therefore, only a subset of all variables in EDAs really function at each generation.|This paper proposes a novel class of EDAs, termed as subspace estimation of distribution algorithms (subEDAs), from a new perspective to reduce the space of variables for use in model building and model sampling based on EDAs' performance. In subEDAs, only part of all variables of candidate individuals are perturbed at each generation. Three schemes are described in details to determine which variables should be perturbed at each generation: the random picking method (RP), the majority voting based on the similarity between high quality individuals (MVSH) and the majority voting based on the difference between high quality and low quality individuals (MVDHL). Then, subEDAs + RP, subEDAs + MVSH and subEDAs + MVDHL are tested on several benchmark functions and their algorithmic results are compared with those obtained by EDAs. Our experimental results indicate that subEDAs are able to obtain a comparative result using only a subset of problem variables in the model when compared with traditional EDAs. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.

It determines the solutions that will be modeled to represent the promising areas of the search space. There is a strong relationship between the strength of selection and the type and number of dependencies that are captured by the models. In this paper we propose to use different selection probabilities to learn the structural and parametric components of the probabilistic graphical models.

Our proposal consists of using estimation of distribution algorithms for approximating counterfactual explanations within Bayesian classifiers. They are experimentally compared with a genetic algorithm, both with a single-objective and with a multi-objective formulation.

In experiments, we do not only compare the proposed methods with conventional EDAs on a few fitness functions but also analyze sampled probabilistic models by using KL-divergence.

Does overfitting affect performance in estimation of distribution algorithms,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000249917300069,"Wu, H and Shapiro, JL","Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) are a class of evolutionary algorithms that use machine learning techniques to solve optimization problems. Machine learning is used to learn probabilistic models of the selected population. This model is then used to generate next population via sampling.

Sampling techniques have a serious problem when the sample size is small, so estimating the objective function values with noise is not accurate in this case. In this research, a new sampling technique is proposed based on fuzzy logic to deal with small sample sizes. Then, simulation-based optimization methods are designed by combining the estimation of distribution algorithms with the proposed sampling technique and other sampling techniques to solve the stochastic programming problems. Moreover, additive versions of the proposed methods are developed to optimize functions without noise in order to evaluate different efficiency levels of the proposed methods.

Efficiency enhancement of estimation of distribution algorithms by a compressed tournament selection,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000334211500040,"Martins, JP and Delbem, ACB","Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDA) are population-based meta-heuristics that use probabilistic models to describe the relationships between variables of a problem. From these models, new solutions can be sampled without disruption of Building Blocks, leading to a more effective search. The key aspect of EDAs is the model-building step and better models should enable a better exploration of the search space. However, high-quality models require computationally expensive algorithms, resulting in too costly EDAs. This paper proposes an efficient implementation of the tournament selection algorithm (TS), called Compressed Tournament Selection (CTS). CTS avoids the insertion of repeated solutions in the population during the TS. Therefore, model-building can be performed on a reduced population (equivalent to the original), improving the EDAs' performance as a whole. In the experiments the method was applied to the Extended Compact Genetic Algorithm and the results showed that by using an appropriate tournament size, CTS can lead to high speed-ups without a decrease of model quality. Besides, CTS keeps the characteristics of TS and can be easily used to enhance the efficiency of any EDA based on the tournament selection algorithm.",2014

The inference is an NP-hard problem. There are several algorithms to make exact and approximate inference. One of the most popular, and that is also an exact method. is the evidence propagation algorithm of Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter [S.L. Lauritzen, D.J. Spiegelhalter, Local computations with probabilities on graphical structures and their application on expert systems, journal of the Royal Statistical Society B 50 (2) (1988) 157-224], improved later by Jensen et al. [F.V. Jensen, S.L. Lauritzen, K.G. Olesen, Bayesian updating in causal probabilistic networks by local computations, In Computational Statistics Quaterly 4 (1990) 269-282]. This algorithm needs an ordering of the variables in order to make the triangulation of the moral graph associated with the original Bayesian network structure. The effectiveness of the inference depends on the variable ordering. In this paper, we will use a new paradigm for evolutionary computation, the estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), to get the optimal ordering of the variables to obtain the most efficient triangulation. We will also present a new type of evolutionary algorithm, the recursive EDAs (REDAs). We will prove that REDAs improve the behaviour of EDAs in this particular problem, and that their results are competitive with other triangulation techniques. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Estimation of Distribution Algorithms as Logistic Regression Regularizers of Microarray Classifiers,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000266932600003,"Bielza, C, Robles, V and Larrañaga, P","Objectives: The ""large k (genes), small N (samples)"" phenomenon complicates the problem of microarray classification with logistic regression. The indeterminacy of the maximum likelihood solutions, multicollinearity of predictor variables and data over-fitting cause unstable parameter estimates. Moreover, computational problems arise due to the large number of predictor (genes) variables. Regularized logistic regression excels as a solution. However, the difficulties found here involve an objective function hard to be optimized from a mathematical viewpoint and a careful required tuning of the regularization parameters.|Methods: Those difficulties are tackled by introducing a new way of regularizing the logistic regression. Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), a kind of evolutionary algorithms, emerge as natural regularizers. Obtaining the regularized estimates of the logistic classifier amounts to maximizing the likelihood function via our EDA, without having to be penalized. Likelihood penalties add a number of difficulties to the resulting optimization problems, which vanish in our case. Simulation of new estimates during the evolutionary process of EDAs is performed in such a way that guarantees their shrinkage while maintaining their probabilistic dependence relationships learnt. The EDA process is embedded in an adapted recursive feature elimination procedure, thereby providing the genes that are best markers for the classification.|Results: The consistency with the literature and excellent classification performance achieved with our algorithm are illustrated on four microarray data sets: Breast, Colon, Leukemia and Prostate. Details on the last two data sets are available as supplementary material.|Conclusions: We have introduced a novel EDA-based logistic regression regularizer.

Several studies have demonstrated that the heuristic scheme of EDAs is effective and efficient for many optimization problems. Recently, it has been reported that the incorporation of mutation into EDAs increases the diversity of genetic information in the population, thereby avoiding premature convergence into a suboptimal solution. In this study, we propose a new mutation operator, a transpose mutation, designed for Bayesian structure learning. It enhances the diversity of the offspring and it increases the possibility of inferring the correct arc direction by considering the arc directions in candidate solutions as bi-directional, using the matrix transpose operator.

A Gaussian distribution over continuous variables is commonly used, with several different covariance matrix structures ranging from diagonal i.e. Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm (UMDA(c)) to full i.e. Estimation of Multivariate Normal density Algorithm (EMNA). A diagonal covariance model is simple but is unable to directly represent covariances between problem variables. On the other hand, a full covariance model requires estimation of (more) parameters from the selected population. In practice, numerical issues can arise with this estimation problem. In addition, the performance of the model has been shown to be sometimes undesirable. In this paper, a modified Gaussian-based continuous EDA is proposed, called sEDA, that provides a mechanism to control the amount of covariance parameters estimated within the Gaussian model. To achieve this, a simple variable screening technique from experimental design is adapted and combined with an idea inspired by the Pareto-front in multi-objective optimization. Compared to EMNA(global), the algorithm provides improved numerical stability and can use a smaller selected population. Experimental results are presented to evaluate and compare the performance of the algorithm to UMDA(c) and EMNA(global)",2012

A key parameter of most EDAs is the sample size (population size). Too small values lead to the undesired effect of genetic drift, while larger values slow down the process. Building on a quantitative analysis of how the population size leads to genetic drift, we design a smart-restart mechanism for EDAs. By stopping runs when the risk for genetic drift is high, it automatically runs the EDA in good parameter regimes. Via a mathematical runtime analysis, we prove a general performance guarantee for this smart-restart scheme. For many situations where the optimal parameter values are known, this shows that the restart scheme automatically finds these optimal values, leading to the asymptotically optimal performance. We also conduct an extensive experimental analysis. On four classic benchmarks, the smart-restart scheme leads to a performance close to the one obtainable with optimal parameter values. We also conduct experiments with PBIL (cross-entropy algorithm) on the max-cut problem and the bipartition problem. Again, the smart-restart mechanism finds much better values for the population size than those suggested in the literature, leading to a much better performance.",2023

Finite population sampling in selection results in fluctuations which get reinforced when the probability model is updated. As a consequence, any probability model which can generate only a single set of values with probability 1 can be an attractive fixed point of the algorithm. To avoid this, parameters of the algorithm must scale with the system size in strongly problem-dependent ways, or the algorithm must be modified. This phenomenon is shown to hold for general EDAs as a consequence of the lack of ergodicity and irreducibility of the Markov chain on the state of probability models. It is illustrated in the case of UMDA, in which it is shown that the global optimum is only found if the population size is sufficiently large. For the needle-in-a haystack problem, the population size must scale as the square-root of the size of the search space. For the one-max problem, the population size must scale as the square-root of the problem size.",2005

Understanding the relationship between EDAs and the space of optimization problems is a fundamental issue for the successful application of this type of algorithms. A step forward in this matter is to create a taxonomy of optimization problems according to the different behaviors that an EDA can exhibit. This paper substantially extends previous work in the proposal of a taxonomy of problems for univariate EDAs, mainly by generalizing those results to EDAs that are able to deal with multivariate dependences among the variables of the problem. Through the definition of an equivalence relation between functions, it is possible to partition the space of problems into equivalence classes in which the algorithm has the same behavior. We provide a sufficient and necessary condition to determine the equivalence between functions. This condition is based on a set of matrices which provides a novel encoding of the relationship between the function and the probabilistic model used by the algorithm. The description of the equivalent functions belonging to a class is studied in depth for EDAs whose probabilistic model is given by a chordal Markov network. Assuming this class of factorization, we unveil the intrinsic connection between the behaviors of EDAs and neighborhood systems defined over the search space. In addition, we carry out numerical simulations that effectively reveal the different behaviors of EDAs for the injective functions defined over the search space (0, 1}(3).

The high dimensionality of the texts themselves implies a larger number of network parameters and a more complex optimization surface. Artificial neural network training is an NP-Hard optimization problem, which has been addressed by methods based on partial derivatives of the objective function and presents several theoretical and practical limitations, such as the probability of convergence to local minimums. In this work, we propose a hybrid method based on the Estimation of Distribution Algorithms for training a Convolutional Neural Network. For this, we train together gradient-based methods with the Estimation of Multivariate Normal Algorithm and Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm by dividing the training process into two stages. The different variants obtained with the proposed method are compared with gradient-based methods on public benchmark datasets and statistical differences are analyzed by nonparametric tests. The proposed method increases the accuracy of the convolutional network applied to the text categorization task and overcome in about 0.22%-24% the state-of-the-art algorithms. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we present a new multi-objective feature selection algorithm MOEDAFS (Multi-Objective Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDA) for Feature Selection). The MOEDAFS is based on EDA and Mutual Information (MI). EDA is used to explore the search space and MI is integrated as a probabilistic model to guide the search by modeling the redundancy and relevance relations between features. Therefore, we propose four probabilistic models for MOEDAFS. MOEDAFS selects the better feature subsets (non-dominated solutions) that have a better detection accuracy and smaller number of features. MOEDAFS uses two objective functions (minimizing classification Error Rate (ER) and minimizing the Number of Features(NF)). In order to demonstrate the performance of MOEDAFS, a comparative study is designed by internal and external comparison on NSL-KDD dataset.

From a theoretical point of view, an EDA can be modeled as a sequence of densities in a statistical model that converges towards distributions with reduced support. Under this framework, at each iteration the empirical mean of the fitness function decreases in probability, until convergence of the population. This is the context of stochastic relaxation, i.e., the idea of looking for the minima of a function by minimizing its expected value over a set of probability densities. Our main interest is in the study of the gradient of the expected value of the function to be minimized, and in particular on how its landscape changes according to the fitness function and the statistical model used in the relaxation. After introducing some properties of the exponential family, such as the description of its topological closure and of its tangent space, we provide a characterization of the stationary points of the relaxed problem, together with a study of the minimizing sequences with reduced support. The analysis developed in the paper aims to provide a theoretical understanding of the behavior of EDAs, and in particular their ability to converge to the global minimum of the fitness function. The theoretical results of this paper, beside providing a formal framework for the analysis of EDAs, lead to the definition of a new class algorithms for binary functions optimization based on Stochastic Natural Gradient Descent (SNGD), where the estimation of the parameters of the distribution is replaced by the direct update of the model parameters by estimating the natural gradient of the expected value of the fitness function.",2011

These guidelines will enhance the designed algorithms in balancing the intensification and diversification effects of EDAs. Most EDAs have the advantage of incorporating probabilistic models which can generate chromosomes with the non-disruption of salient genes. This advantage, however, may cause the problem of the premature convergence of EDAs resulted in the probabilistic models no longer generating diversified solutions. In addition, due to overfitting of the search space, probabilistic models cannot really represent the general information of the population. Therefore, this research will deduce important guidelines through the convergency speed analysis of EDAs under different computational times for designing effective EDA algorithms. The major idea is to increase the population diversity gradually by hybridizing EDAs with other meta-heuristics and replacing the procedures of sampling new solutions. According to that, this research further proposes an Adaptive EA/G to improve the performance of EA/G. The proposed algorithm solves the single machine scheduling problems with earliness/tardiness cost in a just-in-time scheduling environment. The experimental results indicated that the Adaptive EA/G outperforms ACGA and EA/G statistically significant in different stopping criteria.

In order to overcome these two drawbacks, we solve the UAV path planning in a new coordinate system. As the new coordinate system is only a rotation of Cartesian coordinate system, it is inherently easy for local modification.

This paper introduces and evaluates a novel estimation of a distribution algorithm, called L1-regularized Bayesian optimization algorithm, L1BOA. In L1BOA, Bayesian networks as probabilistic models are learned in two steps. First, candidate parents of each variable in Bayesian networks are detected by means of L1-regularized logistic regression, with the aim of leading a sparse but nearly optimized network structure. Second, the greedy search, which is restricted to the candidate parent-child pairs, is deployed to identify the final structure. Compared with the Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA), L1BOA improves the efficiency of structure learning due to the reduction and automated control of network complexity introduced with L1-regularized learning. Experimental studies on different types of benchmark problems show that L1BOA not only outperforms BOA when no prior knowledge about problem structure is available, but also achieves and even exceeds the best performance of BOA that applies explicit controls on network complexity. Furthermore, Bayesian networks built by L1BOA and BOA during evolution are analysed and compared, which demonstrates that L1BOA is able to build simpler, yet more accurate probabilistic models.",2013

This article introduces a method for automated topological optimization via an Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) with a suitable representation of the optimization variables. The optimum structure is such with the minimum weight which does not exceed a maximum von Mises stress and displacement. The contributions of this proposal resides in the definition of a candidate solution and the optimization method. The candidate solution representation is independent of the finer discretization used for analyzing candidate structures using the finite element method. Given a domain Omega, which corresponds to the physical space where candidate structures reside, a vector phi = [phi(1), phi(2), ..., phi(m)] is used to define a smooth function (phi) over cap (x, y) on Omega. If (phi) over cap (x, y) is less than 0.5, such region does not have material, otherwise, it has. The smooth function phi(x, y) provides the advantage of having continuous regions with or without material while it depends on few optimization parameters 0, in addition, we can define an arbitrary number of parts or gaps as thinner or larger as needed. The EDA benefits from this representation, sampling random arbitrary structures and using probabilistic learning to determine whether a region must have material. The EDA is a global optimizer which can propose different topologies without the need of a priori knowledge neither initial solutions. In addition it uses a probabilistic model which smoothly evolve through generations. In consequence, at the beginning of the optimization process it arbitrarily proposes topologically different structures, while at the convergence phase it performs similar to a local search algorithm. The EDA uses few parameters which can be set in a straight forward manner. We report several study cases from the specialized literature, showing that our proposal outperforms reported results from up-to-date well performed algorithms.",2015

However, application of only one probabilistic model may not represent the parental distribution well. This paper advocates the importance of using ensemble probabilistic models in EDAs. We combine the univariate probabilistic model with the bi-variate probabilistic model which learns different population characteristics.

In this paper, we lay the foundations to elaborate taxonomies of problems under estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). By using an infinite population model and assuming that the selection operator is based on the rank of the solutions, we group optimization problems according to the behavior of the EDA. Throughout the definition of an equivalence relation between functions it is possible to partition the space of problems in equivalence classes in which the algorithm has the same behavior. We show that only the probabilistic model is able to generate different partitions of the set of possible problems and hence, it predetermines the number of different behaviors that the algorithm can exhibit. As a natural consequence of our definitions, all the objective functions are in the same equivalence class when the algorithm does not impose restrictions to the probabilistic model. The taxonomy of problems, which is also valid for finite populations, is studied in depth for a simple EDA that considers independence among the variables of the problem. We provide the sufficient and necessary condition to decide the equivalence between functions and then we develop the operators to describe and count the members of a class. In addition, we show the intrinsic relation between univariate EDAs and the neighborhood system induced by the Hamming distance by proving that all the functions in the same class have the same number of local optima and that they are in the same ranking positions.

Integrated with clustering strategies for crowding and speciation, two versions of this algorithm are developed, which operate at the niche level.

The dynamic cluster sizing affords a potential balance between exploration and exploitation and reduces the sensitivity to the cluster size in the niching methods. Taking advantages of Gaussian and Cauchy distributions, we generate the offspring at the niche level through alternatively using these two distributions. Such utilization can also potentially offer a balance between exploration and exploitation. Further, solution accuracy is enhanced through a new local search scheme probabilistically conducted around seeds of niches with probabilities determined self-adaptively according to fitness values of these seeds.

Exhaustively checking the state space of a large system, a system with many concurrent components for example, is often intractable. In this scenario, heuristic mechanisms can be employed with the task of detecting errors rather than proving the system is correct. Recently, a metaheuristic EDA-based approach to detecting deadlock in multithreaded Java software has shown great promise in this area. In this paper, we extend that work to search Promela models for counterexamples. We show that the EDA-based technique can find errors where algorithms such as A* search fail. We also show the ability of the EDA to find shorter errors than those discovered by traditional heuristic methods.",2011

MN-GIBBS uses a Markov network easily derived from the ADF and Gibbs sampling. We discuss different variants of Gibbs sampling.

We then show how multi-variate EDAs linkage learning mechanisms can be misled with the help of two test problems; the concatenated parity function (CPF), and the concatenated parity/trapfunction (CP/TF). Although these functions are separable, with bounded complexity and uniformly scaled sub-function contributions, the hierarchical Bayesian Optimization Algorithm (hBOA) scales exponentially on both. We argue that test problems containing parity functions are hard for EDAs because there are no interactions in the contribution to fitness between any strict subset of a parity function's bits. This means that as population sizes increase the dependency between variable values for any strict subset of a parity function's bits decreases. Unfortunately most EDAs including hBOA search for their models by looking for dependencies between pairs of variables (at least at first).

They are similar to Genetic Algorithms (GAs), in the sense that, given a problem, they use a population of individuals to represent solutions, and this population is made to evolve towards the most promising solutions. However, instead of using the usual GA-operators such as mutation or crossover, EDAs learn a probabilistic model that tries to capture the main characteristics of the problem. Based on this idea, several EDAs have been introduced in the last years, showing a good performance and being able to solve problems of different complexity. One important drawback of EDAs is the significant computational effort required by the utilization of probabilistic models, when applied to real-world problems. This fact has led the research community to apply parallel schemes to EDAs, as a viable way to reduce execution times. Schemes already proposed for GAs have been used as the foundation for these parallel schemes. In this chapter, we make a review of parallel EDAs, with a main focus: identifying those parts that are susceptible of parallelization.

For the UMDA, the currently known expected runtime on the function is O(n lambda log lambda + n(2)) under an offspring population size lambda = Omega(log n) and a parent population size mu <= lambda/(e(1 + delta)) for any constant delta > 0 (Dang and Lehre, GECCO 2015). There is no lower bound on the expected runtime under the same parameter settings. It also remains unknown whether the algorithm can still optimise the LeadingOnes function within a polynomial runtime when mu >= lambda/(e(1+delta)). In case of the PBIL, an expected runtime of O(n(2+c)) holds for some constant c is an element of(0,1) (Wu, Kolonko and Mohring, IEEE TEVC 2017). Despite being a generalisation of the UMDA, this upper bound is significantly asymptotically looser than the upper bound of O(n(2) of the UMDA for lambda=Omega(log n) boolean AND O. Furthermore, the required population size is very large, i.e., lambda=Omega(n(1+c)). Our contributions are then threefold: (1) we show that the UMDA with mu=Omega(log n) and lambda <= mu e(1-epsilon)/(1+delta) for any constants epsilon is an element of(0,1) and 0 < delta <= e(1-epsilon)-1 requires an expected runtime of e(Omega(mu)) on LEADINGONES, (2) an upper bound of O(n lambda log lambda + n(2)) is shown for the PBIL, which improves the current bound O(n(2+c)) by a significant factor of Theta(n(c)), and (3) we for the first time consider the two algorithms on the LeadingOnes function in a noisy environment and obtain an expected runtime of O(n(2)) for appropriate parameter settings.

The main aim of FS is to determine a minimal feature subset from a problem domain while retaining a suitably high accuracy in representing the original set of features. However, the problem of finding optimal reductions is challenging as there is always a trade-off between the extent of reduction and the resulting information loss. This topic has been of particular interest in rough and fuzzy-rough set theory, as these provide a mechanism for defining optimality using only the data itself. Evolutionary methods have been used to try to find rough and fuzzy-rough optimal reductions, but these approaches ignore the fact that not all equally-sized reducts have the same utility for classifiers.

A Bayesian View on the Polynomial Distribution Model in Estimation of Distribution Algorithms,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000263406500041,"Ding, N, Zhou, SD, Sun, ZQ","Estimation of distribution algorithms(EDA) are a class of recently-developed evolutionary algorithms in which the probabilistic model are used to explicitly characterize the distribution of the population and to generate new individuals. The polynomial distribution is applied by discrete EDAs and continuous EDAs based on discretization of the domain such as histogram-based EDA. We can unify those kinds of EDA from their distribution and call them PolyEDA. In this paper, we theoretically analyze PolyEDA from a Bayesian analysis view. Our analysis is based on the assumption that the prior distribution of the parameters satisfies a Dirichlet Distribution, because under this assumption the formulation can be analytically solved. Furthermore, we notice that the prior distribution is always overlooked by previous algorithms, so we follow this way and propose some strategies to improve the PolyEDA.

History matching is an example of an inverse problem, and there is significant active research on inverse problems in many other scientific and engineering areas. While many techniques from other fields, such as genetic algorithms, evolutionary strategies, differential evolution, particle swarm optimization, and the ensemble Kalman filter have been tried in the oil industry, more recent and effective ideas have yet to be tested. One of these relatively untested ideas is a class of algorithms known as estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). EDAs are population-based algorithms that use probability models to estimate the probability distribution of promising solutions, and then to generate new candidate solutions. EDAs have been shown to be very efficient in very complex high-dimensional problems.|An example of a state-of-the-art EDA is the Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA), which is a multivariate EDA employing Bayesian networks for modeling the relationships between good solutions. The use of a Bayesian network leads to relatively fast convergence as well as high diversity in the matched models. Given the relatively limited number of reservoir simulations used in history matching, EDA-BOA offers the promise of high-quality history matches with a fast convergence rate.|In this paper, we introduce EDAs and describe BOA in detail. We show results of the EDA-BOA algorithm on two history-matching problems. First, we tune the algorithm, demonstrate convergence speed, and search diversity on the PUNQ-S3 synthetic case. Second, we apply the algorithm to a real North Sea turbidite field with multiple wells. In both examples, we show improvements in performance over traditional population-based algorithms.",2013

Gibbs sampling allows us to sample new individuals inside the boundaries of the polyhedral search space described using a set of linear inequality constraints by iteratively constructing a density approximation that lies entirely inside the polyhedron. Gibbs sampling prevents the creation of infeasible solutions. Thus, no additional techniques for handling infeasible solutions are needed in PolyEDA.

Harmless Overfitting: Using Denoising Autoencoders in Estimation of Distribution Algorithms,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000542194600001,"Probst, M and Rothlauf, F","Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) are metaheuristics where learning a model and sampling new solutions replaces the variation operators recombination and mutation used in standard Genetic Algorithms. The choice of these models as well as the corresponding training processes are subject to the bias/variance tradeoff, also known as under- and overfitting: simple models cannot capture complex interactions between problem variables, whereas complex models are susceptible to modeling random noise. This paper suggests using Denoising Autoencoders (DAEs) as generative models within EDAs (DAE-EDA). The resulting DAE-EDA is able to model complex probability distributions. Furthermore, overfitting is less harmful, since DAEs overfit by learning the identity function. This overfitting behavior introduces unbiased random noise into the samples, which is no major problem for the EDA but just leads to higher population diversity. As a result, DAE-EDA runs for more generations before convergence and searches promising parts of the solution space more thoroughly. We study the performance of DAE-EDA on several combinatorial single-objective optimization problems. In comparison to the Bayesian Optimization Algorithm, DAE-EDA requires a similar number of evaluations of the objective function but is much faster and can be parallelized efficiently, making it the preferred choice especially for large and difficult optimization problems.",2020

Compared to Michigan-style GBML, Pittsburgh-style GBML is expected to achieve more compact solutions. It has been shown that standard recombination operators in EAs do not assure an effective evolutionary search to solve sophisticated problems that contain strong interactions between features. On the other hand, when dealing with real-world classification tasks, irrelevant features not only complicate the problem but also incur unnecessary matchings in GBML systems, which increase the computational cost a lot. To handle the two problems mentioned above in an integrated manner, a new Pittsburgh-style GBML system is proposed. In the proposed method, classifiers are generated and recombined at two levels. At the high level, classifiers are recombined by rule-wise uniform crossover operators since each classifier consists of a variable-size rule set. At the low level, single rules contained in classifiers are reproduced via sampling Bayesian networks that characterize the global statistical information extracted from promising rules found so far. Furthermore, according to the statistical information in the rule population, an embedded approach is presented to detect and remove redundant features incrementally following the evolution of rule population.

Furthermore, the proposed method is also competitive to other non-evolutionary, highly used machine learning methods.

Since information is usually represented as a probabilistic graphic model, the effectiveness of EDAs strongly depends on how accurately such models represent the population. In this sense, models of increasing complexity have been employed by EDAs, with the most successful ones being able to encode multivariate factorizations of joint probability distributions. However, some studies have shown that even multivariate EDAs fail to build accurate models for problems in which there is an intrinsic pairwise independence between variables. This study elucidates how pairwise independence impacts the linkage learning procedures of multivariate EDAs and affects their accuracy. First, the necessary conditions for learning additively separable functions are assessed, from which it is shown that extreme multimodality can induce pairwise independence. Second, it is demonstrated that in the presence of pairwise independence the approximate linkage learning procedures employed by many EDAs are not able to retrieve high-order dependences. Finally, in an attempt to infer how likely pairwise independence occur in practical problems, the case of non-separable functions is empirically investigated. For this purpose, the NK-model and the Linkage-Tree Genetic Algorithm (LTGA) were used as a study case and a range of usefulness for the LTGA was estimated according to N (problem size) and K (degree of interactions among variables and multimodality). The results indicated that LTGA linkage learning is probably more useful for K <= 6 on instances with random linkages (this range grows with N), and for K <= 9 on instances with nearest-neighbor linkages (this range is stable with N). Outside these ranges, pairwise independence is more likely to occur, which deteriorates models accuracy and impairs LTGA performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2016

Effects of Discrete Hill Climbing on Model Building for Estimation of Distribution Algorithms,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000321981300047,"Chen, WM, Hsu, CY, Chien, WC","Hybridization of global and local searches is a well-known technique for optimization algorithms. Hill climbing is one of the local search methods. On estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), hill climbing strengthens the signals of dependencies on correlated variables and improves the quality of model building, which reduces the required population size and convergence time. However, hill climbing also consumes extra computational time. In this paper, analytical models are developed to investigate the effects of combining two different hill climbers with the extended compact genetic algorithm and the dependency structure matrix genetic algorithm. By using the one-max problem and the 5-bit non-overlapping trap problem as the test problems, the performances of different hill climbers are compared. Both analytical models and experiments reveal that the greedy hill climber reduces the number of function evaluations for EDAs to find the global optimum.",2013

This article describes an effective method for optimizing the trajectory of a spacecraft using an evolutionary approach based on EDAs, incorporated with fitness landscape analysis (FLA). The approach utilizes flexible operators that are paired with seeding and selection mechanisms of EDAs. Initially, the orbit transfer problem is mathematically modeled and the objectives and constraints are identified. The landscape feature of the search space is analyzed via the dispersion metric to measure the modality and ruggedness of the search domain. The obtained information are used as feedback in developing adaptive operators for truncation factor and constraints separation threshold of the employed EDA.

How to Get More from Your Model: The Role of Constructive Selection in Estimation of Distribution Algorithms,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000625865500051,"Caldwell, JR and Watson, RA","Model-building optimisation methods aim to learn the structure underlying a problem and exploit this to direct the exploration of solutions. This generally interleaves two processes: Generating samples (from the model), and updating the model (using selected samples). In most estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), e.g. BOA, selection is used only in the laSer, to determine which samples are retained for updating the model. In contrast, other evolution-inspired algorithms (such as rHN-G and MACRO) use selection differently - within the process that generates samples from the model. It has been hypothesised that this 'constructive selection' process can facilitate optimisation that other EDAs cannot but this has not been previously shown. Here we investigate these distinctions using constraint optimisation problems with a very simple modular structure. We find that a simple constructive selection method (rHN-g) can solve these problems in time polynomial in the problem size whereas other methods, such as BOA, require exponential time. We confirm that this result arises not from any difficulty in acquiring an accurate model but because of how samples are generated given the model. This suggests that by using constructive selection other EDAs could exploit the models they learn more efficiently to solve otherwise unsolvable problems.",2017

As a simple and efficient approximation approach, k-nearest neighbors (kNN) estimates the fitness value of an unknown solution by combining the fitness values of its nearest neighbors according to a similarity measure. kNN generally adopts the Euclidean distance as the similarity measure, which may limit its performance as the solution distribution information is underutilized in the approximation process. Aiming at this issue, this study proposes a Mahalanobis distance-based k-nearest neighbors (MkNN) to improve the approximation accuracy by utilizing the distribution information. Compared to the Euclidean distance-based kNN (EkNN), MkNN adopts the Mahalanobis distance to measure the similarity between solutions, which is capable of capturing the distribution information of solutions and thus can improve the approximation efficiency. Furthermore, considering that the main idea of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) is also to learn the distribution information of solutions, the proposed MkNN as well as EkNN are combined with an EDA and two new algorithms named EDA-MkNN and EDA-EkNN, respectively, are developed for expensive optimization. The performances of EDA-MkNN and EDA-EkNN were comprehensively tested on a set of 28 benchmark functions and compared with that of a typical EDA.

In this article, we consider also AMaLGaM, an enhanced Gaussian EDA, as well as arguably the most powerful real-valued black-box optimization algorithm to date, CMA-ES, which can also be seen as a further enhanced Gaussian EDA. We study whether the well-known performance on typical benchmark problems extends to the CiaS problem. We find that although the enhancements over a basic Gaussian EDA result in superior performance, the further efficiency enhancements in CMA-ES are not highly impactful. Instead, the most impactful features are how constraint handling is performed, how large the population size is, whether a full covariance matrix is used and whether restart techniques are used. We further show that a previously published version of AMaLGaM that does not require the user to set the the population size parameter is capable of solving the problem and we derive the scalability of the required number of function evaluations to solve the problem up to 99.99 % of the known optimal value for up to 30 circles.",2018

By iterative filtering for quality solution from competing ones, the probability model eventually approximates the distribution of global optimum solutions. In contrast to classic evolutionary algorithms (EAs), EDA framework is flexible and is able to handle inter variable dependence, which usually imposes difficulties on classic EAs. The success of EDA relies on effective and efficient building of the probability model. This paper facilitates EDA from the adaptive memory programming (AMP) domain which has developed several improved forms of EAs using the Cyber-EA framework. The experimental result on benchmark TSP instances supports our anticipation that the AMP strategies can enhance the performance of classic EDA by deriving a better approximation for the true distribution of the target solutions.",2013

In particular, permutation representations suitable for Estimation of Distribution algorithms (EDAs) are known to present several challenges. Therefore, it is of interest to investigate novel representations and their properties. In this paper, we present a study of the factoradic representation which offers new modelling insights through the use of three algorithmic frameworks, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and two EDAs. Four classic permutation benchmark problems are used to evaluate the factoradic-based algorithms in comparison with published work with other representations. Our experiments demonstrate that the factoradic representation is a competitive approach to apply to permutation problems.

Regarding this success, it is tempting to apply EDAs to real-world problems. But up to now, it has rarely been analyzed which real-world problems are decomposable. The main contribution of this chapter is twofold: (1) It shows that uncapacitated single-product and multi-product lotsizing problems are decomposable. (2) A state-of-the-art EDA is used to solve both problems. The problems are fundamental in inventory management and their fitness functions can be expressed as additively decomposable functions. It is analyzed how a search distribution of Boltzmann-type factorizes for these functions and it is shown that the factorizations of the Boltzmann distribution are polynomially bounded. Consequently, experimental scalability analysis is conducted for both problems with a state-of-the-art EDA.

Both EDAs and IAs are extended from genetic algorithms (GAs). EDAs eliminate the genetic operation including crossover and mutation from the GAs and places more emphasis on the relation between gene loci. It adopts the distribution of selected individuals in search space and models the probability distributions to generate the next population. However, the primary gap of EDAs is lock of diversity between individuals. Hence, we introduce the IAs that is a new branch in computational intelligence. The main concepts of IAs are suppression and hypermutation that make the individuals be more diversity. Moreover, the primary gap of IAs is to pay no attention to the relation between individuals. Therefore, we combine the main concepts of two algorithms to improve the gaps each other.

Using Maximum Entropy and Generalized Belief Propagation in Estimation of Distribution Algorithms,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000324600300012,"Höns, R","EDAs work by sampling a population from a factorized distribution, like the Boltzmann distribution of an additively decomposable fitness function (ADF). In the Factorized Distribution Algorithm (FDA), a factorization is built from an ADF by choosing a subset of the factors. I present a new algorithm to merge factors into larger sets, allowing to account for all dependencies between the variables. Estimating larger subset distributions is more prone to sample noise, so the larger distribution can be estimated from the smaller ones with the Maximum Entropy method. Building an exact graphical model for sampling is often infeasible. E.g. in a 2-D grid the triangulated Markov network has linear clique size, thus exponentially large distributions.

Most data clustering algorithms require the user to set a number of pre-defined parameters that have decisive impact in the formation of clusters, such as the number of clusters (initial or final), cluster radius, minimum number of objects, and similar parameters. In addition, several clustering algorithms are limited with regard to the shape of clusters that can be found, a limitation usually resulting from the optimisation process performed over a given distance metric. In this work, we propose a novel clustering algorithm that addresses the two aforementioned problems regarding the amount of parameters and cluster shape. Our approach makes use of the theory of Estimation of Distribution Algorithms in order to probabilistic sample a set of must-link/cannot link constraints in order to generate a data partition with the proper number of clusters.

DICE: exploiting all bivariate dependencies in binary and multary search spaces,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000441387800002,"Lane, F, Azad, RMA and Ryan, C","Although some of the earliest Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) utilized bivariate marginal distribution models, up to now, all discrete bivariate EDAs had one serious limitation: they were constrained to exploiting only a limited O(d) subset out of all possible bivariate dependencies. As a first we present a family of discrete bivariate EDAs that can learn and exploit all dependencies between variables, and yet have the same run-time complexity as their more limited counterparts. This family of algorithms, which we label DICE (DIscrete Correlated Estimation of distribution algorithms), is rigorously based on sound statistical principles, and particularly on a modelling technique from statistical physics: dichotomised multivariate Gaussian distributions. Initially (Lane et al. in European Conference on the Applications of Evolutionary Computation, Springer, 1999), DICE was trialled on a suite of combinatorial optimization problems over binary search spaces. Our proposed dichotomised Gaussian (DG) model in DICE significantly outperformed existing discrete bivariate EDAs; crucially, the performance gap increasingly widened as dimensionality of the problems increased. In this comprehensive treatment, we generalise DICE by successfully extending it to multary search spaces that also allow for categorical variables. Because correlation is not wholly meaningful for categorical variables, interactions between such variables cannot be fully modelled by correlation-based approaches such as in the original formulation of DICE. Therefore, here we extend our original DG model to deal with such situations. We test DICE on a challenging test suite of combinatorial optimization problems, which are defined mostly on multary search spaces. While the two versions of DICE outperform each other on different problem instances, they both outperform all the state-of-the-art bivariate EDAs on almost all of the problem instances.

Experimental results show the interesting capabilities of both novel approaches with respect to the score value and the number of generations needed to converge.

However, results from genetic algorithms and estimation-of-distribution algorithms indicate that these algorithms treat different linear functions differently. More precisely, an effect called ""domino convergence"" is described in the literature, which means that bits of large weight in the linear function are optimized earlier than bits of low weight. Hence, different linear functions may lead to rather different expected optimization times.|The present paper conducts a study of domino convergence. By rigorous runtime analyses, it is shown that domino convergence is mostly a consequence of the crossover underlying genetic algorithms and EDAs. Here a performance gap of order O(n/logn) between different linear functions is proved. In simple mutationonly EAs the effect of domino convergence is much less pronounced, with the typical performance gap being logarithmic in the population size. The effect disappears when population size 1 is used and the algorithm is reduced to hillclimbing.

The full data association problem in visual tracking is formulated as a combinatorial hypotheses search with a heuristic evaluation function taking into account structural and specific information such as distance, shape, color, etc. To guarantee real-time performance, a time limit is set for the search process explore alternative solutions. This time limit defines the upper bound of the number of evaluations depending on search algorithm efficiency. Estimation distribution algorithms are proposed as an efficient evolutionary computation technique to search in this hypothesis space. Finally, an exhaustive comparison of the performance of alternative algorithms is carried out considering complex representative situations in real video sets. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) are generative neural networks with these desired properties. We integrate an RBM into an EDA and evaluate the performance of this system in solving combinatorial optimization problems with a single objective. We assess how the number of fitness evaluations and the CPU time scale with problem size and complexity. The results are compared to the Bayesian Optimization Algorithm (BOA), a state-of-the-art multivariate EDA, and the Dependency Tree Algorithm (DTA), which uses a simpler probability model requiring less computational effort for training the model. Although RBM-EDA requires larger population sizes and a larger number of fitness evaluations than BOA, it outperforms BOA in terms of CPU times, in particular if the problem is large or complex. This is because RBM-EDA requires less time for model building than BOA. DTA with its restricted model is a good choice for small problems but fails for larger and more difficult problems. These results highlight the potential of using generative neural networks for combinatorial optimization. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2017

The Boltzmann Probability Distribution Function (Boltzmann-PDF) provides advantages when used in energy based EDAs. However, direct sampling from the Boltzmann-PDF to update the probabilistic model is unpractical, and several EDAs employ an approximation to the Boltzmann-PDF by means of a Gaussian distribution that is usually derived by the minimization of the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL-divergence) computed between the Gaussian and the Boltzmann-PDFs. The KL-divergence measure is not symmetric, and this causes the Gaussian approximation to fail at correctly modeling the target function for the EDAs, because the parameters of the Gaussian are not optimally estimated. In this paper, we derive an approximation to the Boltzmann-PDF using Jeffreys' divergence (a symmetric measure) in lieu of the KL-divergence and thus improve the performance of the optimization algorithm.

This paper proposes a novel real-coded stochastic BOA for continuous global optimization by utilizing a stochastic Bayesian network.

In order to generate a new solution, some new structure, and therefore a new Bayesian network is sampled from the current stochastic structure and the new solution will be produced from the sampled Bayesian network. Due to the stochastic structure used in the sampling phase, each sample can be generated based on a different structure. Therefore the different dependency structures can be preserved. Before the new generation is generated, the stochastic network's probability distributions are updated according to the fitness evaluation of the current generation.

PBIL includes many of the features from the genetic algorithm such as binary string representation, the notion of individuals, fitness measures and mutations. Contrary to the genetic algorithm it does not maintain a population of individuals but instead PBIL contains a probability vector.

The population is evaluated and the probability vector is updated by dragging it towards the best individual in the population.

EDAs make good use of the global statistical information collected from previous searches but they do not efficiently use the location information about individual solutions. It is recently realized that global statistical information and location information should complement each other during the evolution process. In view of this, we design the Self-guided GA based on a novel strategy to combine these two kinds of information. The Self-guided GA does not sample new solutions from the probabilistic model. Instead, it estimates the quality of a candidate offspring based on the probabilistic model used in its crossover and mutation operations. In such a way, the mutation and crossover operations are able to generate fitter solutions, thus improving the performance of the algorithm. We tested the proposed algorithm by applying it to deal with the NP-complete flowshop scheduling problem to minimize the makespan.

The search for the best homomorphism is carried out by optimizing an objective function based on similarities between object and relational attributes defined on the graphs. The following optimization procedures are compared and discussed: deterministic tree search, for which new algorithms are detailed, genetic algorithms and estimation of distribution algorithms. In order to assess the performance of theses algorithms using real data, experimental results on supervised, classification of facial features using face images from public databases are presented.

A novel ensemble of classifiers for microarray data classification,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000258833900038,"Chen, YH and Zhao, YO","Micorarray data are often extremely asymmetric in dimensionality, such as thousands or even tens of thousands of genes and a few hundreds of samples. Such extreme asymmetry between the dimensionality of genes and samples presents several challenges to conventional clustering and classification methods. In this paper, a novel ensemble method is proposed. Firstly, in order to extract useful features and reduce dimensionality, different feature selection methods such as correlation analysis, Fisher-ratio is used to form different feature subsets. Then a pool of candidate base classifiers is generated to learn the subsets which are re-sampling from the different feature subsets with PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) algorithm. At last, appropriate classifiers are selected to construct the classification committee using EDAs (Estimation of Distribution Algorithms). Experiments show that the proposed method produces the best recognition rates on four benchmark databases. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2008
An extended probabilistic model building genetic network programming using both of good and bad individuals,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000320335600004,"Li, XN, Mabu, S and Hirasawa, K","Classical estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) generally use truncation selection to estimate the distribution of the good individuals while ignoring the bad ones. However, various researches in evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have reported that the bad individuals may affect and help solving the problem. This paper proposes a new method to use the bad individuals by studying the substructures rather than the entire individual structures to solve reinforcement learning (RL) problems, which generally factorize their entire solutions to the sequences of state-action pairs. This work was studied in a recent graph-based EDA named probabilistic model building genetic network programming (PMBGNP), which could solve RL problems successfully, to propose an extended PMBGNP. The effectiveness of this work is verified in an RL problem, namely robot control.

Towards a Robust Solution of the Non-linear Kinematics for the General Stewart Platform with Estimation of Distribution Algorithms,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000316457200001,"Martinez, EEH, Peña, SIV and Soto, ES","In robotics, solving the direct kinematics problem (DKP) for parallel robots is very often more difficult and time consuming than for their serial counterparts. The problem is stated as follows: given the joint variables, the Cartesian variables should be computed, namely the pose of the mobile platform. Most of the time, the DKP requires solving a non-linear system of equations. In addition, given that the system could be non-convex, Newton or Quasi-Newton (Dogleg) based solvers get trapped on local minima. The capacity of such kinds of solvers to find an adequate solution strongly depends on the starting point. A well-known problem is the selection of such a starting point, which requires a priori information about the neighbouring region of the solution. In order to circumvent this issue, this article proposes an efficient method to select and to generate the starting point based on probabilistic learning. Experiments and discussion are presented to show the method performance. The method successfully avoids getting trapped on local minima without the need for human intervention, which increases its robustness when compared with a single Dogleg approach. This proposal can be extended to other structures, to any non-linear system of equations, and of course, to non-linear optimization problems.",2013

The purpose of this paper is to describe a method that combines such a problem-specific distance metric with information mined from probabilistic models obtained in previous runs of estimation of distribution algorithms with the goal of solving future problem instances of similar type with increased speed, accuracy and reliability. While the focus of the paper is on additively decomposable problems and the hierarchical Bayesian optimization algorithm, it should be straightforward to generalize the approach to other model-directed optimization techniques and other problem classes.

They have the ability to uncover the hidden regularities of problems and then exploit them for effective search. Real-coded Bayesian optimization algorithm (rBOA) which brings the power of discrete BOA to bear upon the continuous domain has been regarded as a milestone in the field of numerical optimization. It has been empirically observed that the rBOA solves, with subquadratic scaleup behavior, numerical optimization problems of bounded difficulty. This underlines the scalability of rBOA (at least) in practice. However, there is no firm theoretical basis for this scalability.|The aim of this paper is to carry out a theoretical analysis of the scalability of rBOA in the context of additively decomposable problems with real-valued variables. The scalability is measured by the growth of the number of fitness function evaluations (in order to reach the optimum) with the size of the problem. The total number of evaluations is computed by multiplying the population size for learning a correct probabilistic model (i.e., population complexity) and the number of generations before convergence, (i.e., convergence time complexity). Experimental results support the scalability model of rBOA. The rBOA shows a subquadratic (in problem size) scalability for uniformly scaled decomposable problems.",2008

While the primary goal of applying EDAs is to discover the global optimum or at least its accurate approximation, besides this, any EDA provides us with a sequence of probabilistic models, which in most cases hold a great deal of information about the problem. Although using problem-specific knowledge has been shown to significantly improve performance of EDAs and other evolutionary algorithms, this readily available source of problem-specific information has been practically ignored by the EDA community. This paper takes the first step toward the use of probabilistic models obtained by EDAs to speed up the solution of similar problems in the future. More specifically, we propose two approaches to biasing model building in the hierarchical Bayesian optimization algorithm (hBOA) based on knowledge automatically learned from previous hBOA runs on similar problems. We show that the proposed methods lead to substantial speedups and argue that the methods should work well in other applications that require solving a large number of problems with similar structure.",2012

Sporadic model building for efficiency enhancement of the hierarchical BOA,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000253571200004,"Pelikan, M, Sastry, K and Goldberg, DE","Efficiency enhancement techniques - such as parallelization and hybridization - are among the most important ingredients of practical applications of genetic and evolutionary algorithms and that is why this research area represents an important niche of evolutionary computation. This paper describes and analyzes sporadic model building, which can be used to enhance the efficiency of the hierarchical Bayesian optimization algorithm (hBOA) and other estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) that use complex multivariate probabilistic models. With sporadic model building, the structure of the probabilistic model is updated once in every few iterations (generations), whereas in the remaining iterations, only model parameters (conditional and marginal probabilities) are updated. Since the time complexity of updating model parameters is much lower than the time complexity of learning the model structure, sporadic model building decreases the overall time complexity of model building. The paper shows that for boundedly difficult nearly decomposable and hierarchical optimization problems, sporadic model building leads to a significant model-building speedup, which decreases the asymptotic time complexity of model building in hBOA by a factor of Theta(n(0.26)) to Theta(n(0.5)) where n is the problem size. On the other hand, sporadic model building also increases the number of evaluations until convergence; nonetheless, if model building is the bottleneck, the evaluation slowdown is insignificant compared to the gains in the asymptotic complexity of model building. The paper also presents a dimensional model to provide a heuristic for scaling the structure-building period, which is the only parameter of the proposed sporadic model-building approach. The paper then tests the proposed method and the rule for setting the structure-building period on the problem of finding ground states of 2D and 3D Ising spin glasses.",2008

Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) are a class of evolutionary algorithms which perform a two-step process: building a probabilistic model from which good solutions may be generated and then using this model to generate new individuals. Two distinct research trends that emerged in the past few years are the hybridization of PSO and EDA algorithms and the parallelization of EDAs to exploit the idea of exchanging the probabilistic model information. In this work, we propose the use of a cooperative PSO/EDA algorithm based on the exchange of heterogeneous probabilistic models. The model is heterogeneous because the cooperating PSO/EDA algorithms use different methods to sample the search space. Three different exchange approaches are tested and compared in this work. In all these approaches, the amount of information exchanged is adapted based on the performance of the two cooperating swarms.

The aim is to effectively combine particle swarm optimization (PSO) with the estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) without losing their unique features. This aim is achieved by incorporating the following mechanisms: (1) selection is applied to the local best solutions in order to obtain more promising individuals for model building, (2) a probabilistic model of the problem is built from the selected solutions, and (3) new individuals are generated by a stochastic combination of the EDA's model sampling method and the PSO's particle moving mechanism. To exhibit the utility of the EPSDA framework, an extended compact particle swarm optimization (EcPSO) is developed by combining the strengths of the extended compact genetic algorithm (EcGA) with binary PSO (BPSO), along the lines of the suggested framework. Due to its effective nature of harmonizing the global search of EcGA with the local search of BPSO, EcPSO is able to discover the optimal solution in a fast and reliable manner.

This is especially useful for black-box optimization where no assumptions are made on the problem being solved, which is characteristic of many cases in solving complex real-world problems. In this paper we consider multi-objective optimization problems with real-valued variables. Although the vast majority of advances in EDA literature concern single-objective optimization, advances have also been made in multi-objective optimization. In this paper we bring together two recent advances, namely incremental Gaussian model building to reduce the required population size and a mixture-based multi-objective framework that has specific methods to better facilitate model-building techniques that span multiple generations. Significantly faster convergence to the optimal Pareto front is achieved on 6 out of 7 artificial benchmark problems from literature. Although results on two of these problems show that building models with higher-order interactions between variables is required, these problems are still artificial. We therefore also consider a more realistic optimization problem in image processing, namely deformable image registration. For this problem too, our results show the need for processing interactions between problem variables, stressing the importance of studying the use of such models. Furthermore, the number of problem variables in the deformable image registration problem can be very large. The building of models with higher-order interactions, especially mixture-based models, then requires very large population sizes. The use of incremental model building is therefore of high importance. This claim is supported by our results that show a huge reduction in the number of required evaluations on this problem.",2012

However, in negotiation systems with time constraints (e.g., resource negotiations for Grid and Cloud computing), it is crucial to optimize either or both price and negotiation speed based on preferences of participants for improving efficiency and increasing utilization. To this end, this work presents the design and implementation of negotiation agents that can optimize both price and negotiation speed (for the given preference settings of these parameters) under a negotiation setting of complete information. Then, to support negotiations with incomplete information, this work deals with the problem of finding effective negotiation strategies of agents by using coevolutionary learning, which results in optimal negotiation outcomes. In the coevolutionary learning method used here, two types of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) such as conventional EDAs (S-EDAs) and novel improved dynamic diversity controlling EDAs ((IDC)-C-2-EDAs) were adopted for comparative studies. A series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance for coevolving effective negotiation strategies using the EDAs. In the experiments, each agent adopts three representative preference criteria: (1) placing more emphasis on optimizing more price, (2) placing equal emphasis on optimizing exact price and speed and (3) placing more emphasis on optimizing more speed. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the coevolutionary learning adopting (IDC)-C-2-EDAs because it generally coevolved effective converged negotiation strategies (close to the optimum) while the coevolutionary learning adopting S-EDAs often failed to coevolve such strategies within a reasonable number of generations.",2013

The first question must be answered oil the basis of formal models, but despite some recent results, the majority of contributions to the held is experimental. The second question should be answered by exploiting the insights that have been gained from formal models, We contribute, to the theoretical literature oil continuous EDAs by focussing on a simple, yet important, question: HOW Should the variances used to sample offspring front change over all EDA run? To answer this question, the convergence process is separated into three phases and it is shown that for each phase, a preferable strategy exists for setting the variances. It is highly likely that the use of variances that have been estimated with maximum likelihood is not optimal. Thus, variance modification policies are not just a nice add-on. In the light of our findings, they become an integral component of continuous EDAs, and they should consider the specific requirements of all phases of the optimization process.",2007
Upper Bounds on the Running Time of the Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm on OneMax,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000458280100011,"Witt, C","The Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm (UMDA) is a randomized search heuristic that builds a stochastic model of the underlying optimization problem by repeatedly sampling. solutions and adjusting the model according to the best mu samples. We present a running time analysis of the UMDA on the classical OneMax benchmark function for wide ranges of the parameters mu and lambda. If mu >= c log n for some constant c > 0 and lambda = (1+ Theta(1)) mu, we obtain a general bound O (mu n) on the expected running time. This bound crucially assumes that all marginal probabilities of the algorithm are confined to the interval [1/n, 1 - 1/n]. If mu >= c' root n log n for a constant c' > 0 and lambda = (1 + Theta(1)) mu, the behavior of the algorithm changes and the bound on the expected running time becomes O(mu root n), which typically holds even if the borders on the marginal probabilities are omitted. The results supplement the recently derived lower bound Omega (mu root n + n log n) by Krejca and Witt (Proceedings of FOGA 2017, ACM Press, New York, pp 65-79, 2017) and turn out to be tight for the two very different choices mu = c log n and mu = c' root n log n.

Alignments are used, on the one hand, to train the statistical models and, on the other, during the decoding process to link the words in the source sentence to the words in the partial hypotheses generated. In both cases, the quality of the alignments is crucial for the success of the translation process. In this paper, we propose several evolutionary algorithms for computing alignments between two sentences in a parallel corpus. This algorithm has been tested on different tasks involving different pair of languages. Specifically, in the two shared tasks proposed in the HLT-NAACL 2003 and in the ACL 2005, the EDA-based algorithm outperforms the best participant systems. In addition, the experiments show that, because of the limitations of the well known statistical alignment models, new improvements in alignments quality could not be achieved by using improved search algorithms only.

In practical applications however, they are mostly used to repeatedly optimize different instances of a single problem class, a setting in which specialized algorithms generally perform better. In this paper, we introduce the concept of a new type of MBEA that can automatically specialize its behavior to a given problem class using tabula rasa self-learning. For this, reinforcement learning is a naturally fitting paradigm. A proof-of-principle framework, called SL-ENDA, based on estimation of normal distribution algorithms in combination with reinforcement learning is defined. SL-ENDA uses an RL-agent to decide upon the next population mean while approaching the rest of the algorithm as the environment. A comparison of SL-ENDA to AMaLGaM and CMA-ES on unimodal noiseless functions shows mostly comparable performance and scalability to the broadly used and carefully manually crafted algorithms. This result, in combination with the inherent potential of self-learning model-based evolutionary algorithms with regard to specialization, opens the door to a new research direction with great potential impact on the field of model-based evolutionary algorithms.",2019

Since each fitness evaluation is expensive in terms of time or resources, the number of possible evaluations is typically several orders of magnitude smaller than in non-expensive problems. Classical optimization methods are not useful in this scenario. In this paper, we propose and analyze UMM, an estimation-of-distribution (EDA) algorithm based on a Mallows probabilistic model and unbalanced rank aggregation (uBorda). Experimental results on black-box versions of LOP and PFSP show that UMM outperforms the solutions obtained by CEGO, a Bayesian optimization algorithm for combinatorial optimization. Nevertheless, a slight modification to CEGO, based on the different interpretations for rankings and orderings, significantly improves its performance, thus producing solutions that are slightly better than those of UMM and dramatically better than the original version. Another benefit of UMM is that its computational complexity increases linearly with both the number of function evaluations and the permutation size, which results in computation times an order of magnitude shorter than CEGO, making it specially useful when both computation time and number of evaluations are limited.",2021

Corruption partially mutates candidate solutions that are used as input to the model, whereas the number of sampling steps defines how often we re-use the output during model sampling as input to the model.

In this paper, we propose two implementations on CUDA to speed up the model building in the extended compact genetic algorithm (ECGA). The first implementation is algorithmically identical to original ECGA. Aiming at a greater speed boost, the second implementation modifies the model building. It slightly decreases the accuracy of models in exchange for more speedup. Empirically, the first implementation achieves a speedup of roughly 359 to the baseline on 500-bit trap problem with order 5, and the second implementation achieves a speedup of roughly 506 to the baseline on the same problem.

SDR: A Better Trigger for Adaptive Variance Scaling in Normal EDAs,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000268226900099,"Bosman, PAN, Grahl, J and Rothlauf, F","Recently, advances have been made in continuous, normal-distribution-based Estimation-of-Distribution (EDAs) by scaling the variance up from the maximum-likelihood estimate. When done properly, such scaling has been shown to prevent premature convergence on slope-like regions of the search space. In this paper we specifically focus on one way of scaling that was previously introduced as Adaptive Variance Scaling (ANTS.). It was found that when using ANTS, the average number of fitness evaluations grows subquadratically with the dimensionality on a wide range of unimodal test-problems, competitively with the CMA-ES. Still, room for improvement exists because the. variance doesn't always have to be scaled. A previously introduced trigger based oil correlation that determines when to apply scaling was shown to fail on higher dimensional problems. Here we provide a new solution called the Standard-Deviation Ratio (SDR.) trigger that is integrated with the Iterated Density-Estimation Evolutionary Algorithm (IDEA). Intuitively put, scaling is triggered with SDR only if improvements are found to be far away from the mean. SDR, works even in high dimensions as a result of factorizing the decision rule behind the trigger according to the estimated Bayesian factorization. We evaluate SDR-AVS-IDEA on the same set of benchmark problems and compare it with ANTS-IDEA and CMA-ES. We find that the addition of SDR gives AVS-IDEA an important extra edge for it to be used in future research and in applications both in single-objective optimization as well as in multi-objective and dynamic optimization In addition, we provide practical rules of thumb for parameter settings for using SDR-AVS-IDEA that, result in an asymptotic scale-up behavior that is sublinear for the population size (O(l(0.85))) and subquadratic (O(l(1.85))) for the number of evaluations.",2007

They are able to take advantage of correlation structure to drive the search more efficiently, and they are able to provide insights about the structure of the search space.

Large-scale continuous global optimisation is key to many modern-day real-world problems. Scaling up EAs to large-scale problems has become one of the biggest challenges of the field.

QSAR models are regression or classification models used in the chemical and biological sciences. Because of high dimensionality problems, a feature selection problem is imminent.

This is the kickoff question for a machine learning approach to classify two widely known PD severity indexes using individual tests from a broad set of non-motor PD clinical scales only.|Methods: The Hoehn & Yahr index and clinical impression of severity index are global measures of PD severity. They constitute the labels to be assigned in two supervised classification problems using only non-motor symptom tests as predictor variables. Such predictors come from a wide range of PD symptoms, such as cognitive impairment, psychiatric complications, autonomic dysfunction or sleep disturbance. The classification was coupled with a feature subset selection task using an advanced evolutionary algorithm, namely an estimation of distribution algorithm.|Results: Results show how five different classification paradigms using a wrapper feature selection scheme are capable of predicting each of the class variables with estimated accuracy in the range of 72-92%. In addition, classification into the main three severity categories (Mild, moderate and severe) was split into dichotomic problems where binary classifiers perform better and select different subsets of non-motor symptoms. The number of jointly selected symptoms throughout the whole process was low, suggesting a link between the selected non-motor symptoms and the general severity of the disease.|Conclusion: Quantitative results are discussed from a medical point of view, reflecting a clear translation to the clinical manifestations of PD. Moreover, results include a brief panel of non-motor symptoms that could help clinical practitioners to identify patients who are at different stages of the disease from a limited set of symptoms, such as hallucinations, fainting, inability to control body sphincters or believing in unlikely facts.

We study the intricate dynamics of the cGA on the test function OneMax, and how its performance depends on the hypothetical population size K, which determines how quickly decisions about promising bit values are fixated in the probabilistic model. It is known that the cGA and the Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm (UMDA), a related algorithm whose population size is called lambda, run in expected time O(nlogn) when the population size is just large enough (K=Theta(nlogn) and lambda=Theta(nlogn) , respectively) to avoid wrong decisions being fixated. The UMDA also shows the same performance in a very different regime (lambda=Theta(logn), equivalent to K=Theta(logn) in the cGA) with much smaller population size, but for very different reasons: many wrong decisions are fixated initially, but then reverted efficiently. If the population size is even smaller (o(logn)), the time is exponential. We show that population sizes in between the two optimal regimes are worse as they yield larger runtimes: we prove a lower bound of omega(K1/3n+nlogn) for the cGA on OneMax for K=O(n/log2n). For K=omega(log3n) the runtime increases with growing K before dropping again to O(Kn+nlogn) for K=omega(nlogn) .

Since optimal negotiation strategies ensure that interacting agents negotiate optimally, finding such strategies-particularly, for the agents having incomplete information about their opponents-is an important and challenging issue to support agent-based automated negotiation systems. To address this issue, we consider the problem of finding optimal negotiation strategies for a bilateral negotiation between self-interested agents with incomplete information through an EDA-based coevolution mechanism. Due to the competitive nature of the agents, EDAs should be able to deal with competitive coevolution based on two asymmetric populations each consisting of self-interested agents. However, finding optimal negotiation solutions via coevolutionary learning using conventional EDAs is difficult because the EDAs suffer from premature convergence and their search capability deteriorates during coevolution. To solve these problems, even though we have previously devised the dynamic diversity controlling EDA ((DC)-C-2-EDA), which is mainly characterized by a diversification and refinement (DR) procedure, (DC)-C-2-EDA suffers from the population reinitialization problem that leads to a computational overhead. To reduce the computational overhead and to achieve further improvements in terms of solution accuracy, we have devised an improved (DC)-C-2-EDA ((IDC)-C-2-EDA) by adopting an enhanced DR procedure and a local neighborhood search (LNS) method.

An unsupervised graph-based approach for the representation of coronary arteries in X-ray angiograms,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000596453400004,"Salazar-Colores, S, Cervantes-Sanchez, F, Cruz-Aceves, I","This paper presents a novel unsupervised framework for the graph-based representation of coronary arteries in X-ray angiograms. The framework consists of the steps of vessel detection, segmentation, and skeleton simplification. Vessel detection is performed by Gaussian matched filters (GMF) trained by the univariate marginal distribution algorithm for a continuous domain. The detection results are evaluated in terms of the area (A(z)) under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The second step is focused on the binary classification of the response obtained from the GMF method. In the final step, the vessel skeleton simplification is carried out by using the Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm. During the computational experiments, the proposed framework obtained a detection performance of A(z) = 0.926. The interclass variance method was selected from five state-of-the-art thresholding methods according to its classification accuracy on the segmentation of the detection response (0.923). In the final step, a graph-based structure of the coronary arteries with a data compression ratio of 0.954 is obtained. Based on the experimental results, the proposed method has demonstrated that it is suitable for a variety of applications in computer-aided diagnosis.",2019
Update Strength in EDAs and ACO: How to Avoid Genetic Drift,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000382659200010,"Sudholt, D and Witt, C","We provide a rigorous runtime analysis concerning the update strength, a vital parameter in probabilistic model-building GAs such as the step size 1/K in the compact Genetic Algorithm (cGA) and the evaporation factor rho in ACO. While a large update strength is desirable for exploitation, there is a general trade-off : too strong updates can lead to genetic drift and poor performance. We demonstrate this trade-off for the cGA and a simple MMAS ACO algorithm on the OneMax function. More precisely, we obtain lower bounds on the expected runtime of Omega(K root n + n log n) and Omega(root n/rho + n log n), respectively, showing that the update strength should be limited to 1/K, rho = O (1/(root n log n)). In fact, choosing 1/K, rho similar to 1/(root n log n) both algorithms efficiently optimize OneMax in expected time O (n log n). Our analyses provide new insights into the stochastic behavior of probabilistic model-building GAs and propose new guidelines for setting the update strength in global optimization.",2016

Motivated by these advances, in this paper we introduce a Thurstone order statistics model, called Plackett-Luce, to the framework of estimation of distribution algorithms. In order to prove the potential of the proposed algorithm, we consider two different permutation problems: the linear ordering problem and the flowshop scheduling problem. In addition, the results are compared with those obtained by the Mallows and the Generalized Mallows proposals.

Information about linkage identifies a subgroup of genes that are found dependent on each other. If such information is precise and properly used, it may significantly improve a method's effectiveness. The recent research shows that to solve problems with so-called overlapping blocks, it is not enough to use linkage of high quality - it is also necessary to use many different linkages that are diverse. Taking into account that the overlapping nature of problem structure is typical for practical problems, it is important to propose methods that are capable of gathering many different linkages (preferably of high quality) to keep them diverse. One of such methods is a Parameter-less Population Pyramid (P3) that was shown highly effective for overlapping problems in binary domains. Since P3 does not apply to permutation optimization problems, we propose a new P3-based method to fill this gap. Our proposition, namely the Parameter-less Population Pyramid for Permutations (P4), is compared with the state-of-the-art methods dedicated to solving permutation optimization problems: Generalized Mallows Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (GM-EDA) and Linkage Tree Gene-pool Optimal Mixing Evolutionary Algorithm (LT-GOMEA) for Permutation Spaces.

We introduce the heuristic functions and the limit models of these two algorithms and analyze stability of these limit models. It is shown that the limit model of UMDA can be trapped at any local optimal solution for some initial probability models. However, degenerate probability density functions (pdfs) at some local optimal solutions are unstable in the limit model of FDA. In particular, the degenerate pdf at the global optimal solution is the unique asymptotically stable point in the limit model of FDA for the optimization of an additively decomposable function.

Several different versions of this algorithm have been proposed and are shown to work well in a number of different optimisation problems. One of the key similarities between all of the DEUM algorithms proposed so far is that they all assume the interaction between variables in the problem to be pre given. In other words, they do not learn the structure of the problem and assume that it is known in advance. Therefore, they may not be classified as full estimation of distribution algorithms. This work presents a fully multivariate DEUM algorithm that can automatically learn the undirected structure of the problem, automatically find the cliques from the structure and automatically estimate a joint probability model of the Markov network. This model is then sampled using Monte Carlo samplers. The proposed DEUM algorithm can be applied to any general optimisation problem even when the structure is not known.",2009

In general, a Boltzmannian system describes a macrostate from the statistics of the constituent microstate where the minimum energy is the most probable. If we model an optimization problem as a Boltzmann process, the global optimum would be the most probable state. To achieve this, we propose an analytical derivation of the minimum distance to the Boltzmann distribution using the parameters and to fit this model. As a case study, we implemented the J-SIGMA methodology on three families of population-based metaheuristics: Swarm, Evolutionary, and Estimation of Distribution, and used a set of continuous optimization functions from CEC'17 to evaluate their performance against other metaheuristics of each family. Finally, from a statistical analysis of the convergence performance, the evidence is shown to affirm that the J-SIGMA methodology can significantly improve the convergence performance of the algorithms, regardless of the metaheuristic family to which it belongs.",2022

So, recently, the model-based evolutionary algorithms (MBEAs) have been suggested in three groups: The estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), surrogate assisted evolutionary algorithms, and the inversed models to map from the objective space to the decision space. In this article, a new approach, based on an inversed model of Gaussian process and random forest framework, is proposed. The main idea is applying the process of random forest variable importance with a random grouping that determines some of the best assignment of decision variables to objective functions in order to form a Gaussian process in inverse models that maps to decision space the rich solutions which are discovered from objective space. Then these inverse models through sampling the objective space generate offspring.

A Random Key based Estimation of Distribution Algorithm for the Permutation Flowshop Scheduling Problem,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000426929700304,"Ayodele, M, McCall, J, Bowie, L","Random Key (RK) is an alternative representation for permutation problems that enables application of techniques generally used for continuous optimisation. Although the benefit of RKs to permutation optimisation has been shown, its use within Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) has been a challenge. Recent research proposing a RK-based EDA (RK-EDA) has shown that RKs can produce competitive results with state of the art algorithms. Following promising results on the Permutation Flowshop Scheduling Problem, this paper presents an analysis of RK-EDA for optimising the total flow time. Experiments show that RK-EDA outperforms other permutation-based EDAs on instances of large dimensions.

A Niching Scheme for EDAs to Reduce Spurious Dependencies,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000321981300048,"Hsu, PC and Yu, TL","This paper proposes a niching scheme, the dependency structure matrix restricted tournament replacement (DSMRTR). The restricted tournament replacement (RTR) is a well-known niching scheme in the field of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). However, RTR induces spurious dependencies among variables, which impair the performance of EDAs. This paper utilizes building-block-wise distances to define a new distance metric, the one-niche distance. For those EDAs which provide explicit linkage information, the one-niche distances can be directly incorporated into RTR. For EDAs without such information, DSMRTR constructs a dependency structure matrix via the differential mutual complement to estimate the one-niche distances. Empirical results show that DSMRTR induces fewer spurious dependencies than RTR does while maintaining enough diversity for EDAs.",2013

Migration of probability models instead of individuals:: An alternative when applying the island model to EDAs,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000224103300025,"delaOssa, L, Gámez, JA and Puerta, JM","In this work we experiment with the application of island models to Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) in the field of combinatorial optimization. This study is motivated by the success obtained by these models when applied to other meta-heuristics (such as genetic algorithms, simulated annealing or VNS) and by the use of a compact representation of the population that make EDAs through probability distributions. This fact can be exploited during information interchange among islands. In this work we experiment with two types of island-based EDAs: (1) migration of individuals, and (2) migration of probability models. Also, two alternatives are studied for the phase of model combinations: assigning constant weights to inner and incoming models or assigning adaptive weights based-on their fitness.

Previous researches have shown that DSMGA can effectively solve nearly decomposable problems. The efficiency of DSMGA and other model-building GAs greatly depend on their interaction-detection metrics. This paper investigates three commonly used metrics, nonlinearity, simultaneity, and entropy. Then it proposes a new interaction-detection metric which aims at what GAs really need. The proposed metric, namely the differential mutual complement, is based on both the disruption and reproduction effects of the crossover operator on significant schemata. Empirical results show that DSMGA with the proposed metric performs better than the other existing metrics on the aspects of sensitivity to threshold and function evaluation. This new metric is shown to perform well on DSMGA and could be expected to work with other EDAs.",2010

Estimation Multivariate Normal Algorithm with Thresheld Convergence,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000390749103079,"Tamayo-Vera, D, Bolufé-Röhler, A and Chen, S","Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) use a subset of solutions from the current population to build a distribution function from which the next generation of solutions is created. If there is poor diversity in the current population, then there is poor diversity in the subset of solutions selected from it and in the next generation that is created from it. Like many metaheuristics, EDAs can suffer from an autocatalytic process in which convergence begets more convergence. In Thresheld Convergence, convergence is ""held"" back by a threshold function, and this new technique has been successfully applied to other metaheuristics to prevent autocatalytic convergence from cascading into premature convergence. In this paper, Thresheld Convergence is applied to Estimation Multivariate Normal Algorithm with a key difference: convergence is controlled in the parameter space instead of the search space. Computational results show that significant improvements can be achieved across a broad range of multi-modal functions.",2016

A general and efficient face feature extraction approach is presented which utilizes linear discriminant information and global search strategy. In order to get rid of redundant information and meanwhile reduce computational burden, we first compute the nonzero feature space of scatter matrix of the training set, and then perform a global search on it to seek out the most valuable discriminant information of faces. Genetic algorithm is used for searching because of its well-known global search ability. Also, good classifiers are designed by using ensemble Artificial Neural Networks.

Up to this moment, three generations of Protein Secondary Structure Algorithms have been defined: The first generation is based on statistical information over single aminoacids, the second generation is based on windows of aminoacids -typically 11-21 aminoacids - and the third generation is based on the usage of evolutionary information. In this paper we propose the usage of naive Bayes and Interval Estimation Naive Bayes (IENB) - a new semi naive Bayes approach - as suitable third generation methods for Protein Secondary Structure Prediction (PSSP). One of the main stages of IENB is based on a heuristic optimization, carried out by estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). EDAs are non-deterministic, stochastic and heuristic search strategies that belong to the evolutionary computation approaches. These algorithms under complex problems, like Protein Secondary Structure Prediction, require intensive calculation.

The framework used is the standard Markowitz mean-variance formulation for portfolio selection with constraints of practical interest, such as minimum and maximum investments per asset and/or on groups of assets. The use of cardinality constraints transforms portfolio selection into an NP-hard mixed-integer quadratic optimization problem that is difficult to solve by standard methods. An implementation of the algorithm that employs a genetic algorithm with a set representation, an appropriately defined mutation operator and Random Assortment Recombination for crossover (RAR-GA) is compared with implementations using various estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs).

We argue that such reproductive bias is due to their high degree of disruptiveness which favors the generation of average quality offspring. Additionally, we demonstrated the impact of linkage learning in decreasing disruptiveness and reproductive bias.

To efficiently handle this process, unlike the standard GE that employs a simple modulo function, the probability concept is introduced to context-free grammar, thereby choosing production rules according to assigned probabilities.

It is a universal problem that all existing Gaussian based EDAs using full covariance matrix suffer from. Through theoretical analysis with examples of simulated data and experiments, we show that the ill-posed covariance matrix strongly affects those EDAs. This paper proposes a Covariance Matrix Repairing (CMR) method to fix ill-posed covariance matrix. CMR significantly improves the robustness of EDAs.

PEA is inspired by estimation of distribution algorithms and quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm, and it has a good balance between exploration and exploitation with very fast computation speed. The individual in PEA is encoded by the probability vector, defined as the smallest unit of information, for the probabilistic representation. The observation step is used in PEA to obtain the observed states of the individual, and the update operator is used to evolve the individual. In the PEA based human tracking framework, tracking is considered to be a function optimization problem, so the aim is to optimize the matching function between the model and the image observation. Since the matching function is a very complex function in high-dimensional space, PEA is used to optimize it. Experiments on 2D and 3D human motion tracking demonstrate the effectiveness, significance and computation efficiency of the proposed human tracking method. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Optimization of noisy fitness functions with univariate marginal distribution algorithm,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000232173100188,"Hong, Y, Ren, QS and Zeng, A","Darwinian-type genetic algorithms stress the performance of an individual. If an individual has a high fitness, it also has a high probability to survive and to generate offspring. Since in optimization of noisy fitness functions, the fitness of a candidate obtained is not accurate. This characteristic induces its clumsiness for noisy optimization. Compared with Darwinian-type genetic algorithms, the novel computing model Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) pay attention to analyzing the selected subpopulations, which makes it more suitable to tackle noisy optimizations. This paper first briefly introduces Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm (UMDA), and then proves that for WOneMax problem with noise, under the probability limited condition, UMDA can converge to the global optimal point. But for the limited population size, noise doesn't only delay the convergent time, but also aggravates genetic drift. Since Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm with Smoothing Filter (SUMDA) is a feasible technique to diminish genetic drift in UMDA, we adopt SUMDA to tackle noisy optimization. Numerical results show that this method is effective.",2005

Contemporary video processing system design is a challenging optimization problem. Generally, several video algorithms must be sequentially applied to real-time video data. Overall image quality depends on the nonlinear interactions between multiple design parameters: variable settings for each module (algorithm), the amount of data being transferred in the video processing chain as well as the order of the cascading modules. Unfortunately, no systematic techniques are currently available to configure the video chain without lengthy trial and error process. We propose a rapid and reliable method for optimization of composite video processing systems based on genetic algorithm coupled with local search heuristics. Video system configuration is evolved toward the best image quality, driven by an objective video quality metric. We analyze several local search approaches, including hill-climbing, simplex and estimation-of-distribution algorithms. Experimental study demonstrates superior performance of memetic strategies over the conventional genetic algorithm.

The heuristic methods, however, lack the mathematical rigor required in the inference of a probability distribution's parameters. In this work, we propose the use of the Nonparametric Bayesian Model known as Dirichlet Process to fit the number of clusters given the data in a modified Population Based Incremental Learning (PBIL) model.

In this paper we present an alternative way of combining probabilistic models. The new proposal for model combination is based on local search methods, and has its motivation in trying to identify what parts of the incoming model can help to improve the inner one, and to use only these parts to update the incoming model, instead of updating the whole one as in [5].

The model used in GOMEA is aimed at modeling the dependency structure between problem variables, so as to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of variation.

A clustering analysis approach is utilized in AMEDA to discover the distribution structure of the population. Based on the distribution information, with a certain probability, a local or a global multivariate Gaussian model (MGM) is built for each solution to sample a new solution. A covariance sharing strategy is designed in AMEDA to reduce the complexity of building MGMs, and an adaptive update strategy of the probability that controls the contributions of the two types of MGMs is developed to dynamically balance exploration and exploitation. AMEDA is compared with four representative MOEAs on a number of test instances with complex Pareto fronts and variable linkages.

This difference can be an important advantage because of two main reasons. First, in some real problems cyclic relationships appear between variables an this fact cannot be represented in a Bayesian network. Secondly, dependency networks can be built easily due to the fact that there is no need to check the existence of cycles as in a Bayesian network.|In this paper we propose to use a general (multivariate) model in order to deal with a richer representation, however, in this initial approach to the problem we also propose to constraint the construction phase in order to use only bivariate statistics.

There are three crucial parameters in hBOA: (1) the selection pressure, (2) the window size for restricted tournaments, and (3) the population size. Although both the selection pressure and the window size influence hBOA performance, the asymptotic time complexity of hBOA should not change with typical choices of these two parameters. However, there is no population size that is suitable for all problems of interest because the population size strongly depends on problem size and problem difficulty. To eliminate the population size, the parameter-less hBOA adopts the population-sizing technique of the parameter-less genetic algorithm. Based on the existing theory, the parameter-less hBOA should be able to solve nearly decomposable and hierarchical problems in a quadratic or subquadratic number of function evaluations without the need for setting any parameters whatsoever. A number of experiments are presented to verify scalability of the parameter-less hBOA.

In each generation, the joint probability distribution of the selected solutions is estimated using a Gaussian Mixture model.

Since the time complexity of updating model parameters is much lower than the time complexity of learning the model structure, sporadic model building decreases the overall time complexity of model building. The paper shows that for boundedly difficult nearly decomposable and hierarchical optimization problems, sporadic model building leads to a significant model-building speedup that decreases the asymptotic time complexity of model building in hBOA by a factor of Theta(n(0.26)) to Theta(n(0.5)), where n is the problem size.

Using metaheuristic algorithms for parameter estimation in generalized Mallows models,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000366805900022,"Aledo, JA, Gámez, JA and Molina, D","This paper deals with the problem of parameter estimation in the generalized Mallows model (GMM) by using both local and global search metaheuristic (MH) algorithms. The task we undertake is to learn parameters for defining the GMM from a dataset of complete rankings/permutations. Several approaches can be found in the literature, some of which are based on greedy search and branch and bound search. The greedy approach has the disadvantage of usually becoming trapped in local optima, while the branch and bound approach, basically A* search, usually comes down to approximate search because of memory requirements, losing in this way its guaranteed optimality. Here, we carry out a comparative study of several MH algorithms (iterated local search (ILS) methods, variable neighborhood search (VNS) methods, genetic algorithms (GAs) and estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs)) and a tailored algorithm A* to address parameter estimation in GMMs. We use 22 real datasets of different complexity, all but one of which were created by the authors by preprocessing real raw data. We provide a complete analysis of the experiments in terms of accuracy, number of iterations and CPU time requirements. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2016
A Novel EDAs Based Method for HP Model Protein Folding,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000274803100041,"Chen, BH, Li, L and Hu, JL","The protein structure prediction (PSP) problem is one of the most important problems in computational biology. This paper proposes a novel Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) based method to solve the PSP problem on HP model. Firstly, a composite fitness function containing the information of folding structure core formation is introduced to replace the traditional fitness function of RP model. It can help to select more optimum individuals for probabilistic model of EDAs algorithm. And a set of guided operators are used to increase the diversity of population and the likelihood of escaping from local optima. Secondly, an improved backtracking repairing algorithm is proposed to repair invalid individuals sampled by the probabilistic model of EDAs for the long sequence protein instances. A detection procedure of feasibility is added to avoid entering invalid closed areas when selecting directions for the residues. Thus, it can significant reduce the number of backtracking operation and the computational cost for long sequence protein. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperform the basic EDAs method. At the same time, it is very competitive with the other existing algorithms for the PSP problem on lattice HP models.",2009

We consider the case of targeted attacks of this kind, and the use of detectors distributed over the area under threat as a protective countermeasure. Such detectors are non-fully reliable, and must be strategically placed in order to maximize the chances of detecting the attack, hence minimizing the expected number of casualties. To this end, different metaheuristic approaches based on local search and on population-based search (such as a hill climber, different Greedy randomized adaptive search procedures, an evolutionary algorithm and several estimation of distribution algorithms) are considered and benchmarked against a powerful greedy heuristic from the literature. We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation on synthetic instances featuring very diverse properties. Most metaheuristics outperform the greedy algorithm, and a hill-climber is shown to be superior to remaining approaches. This hill-climber is subsequently subject to a sensitivity analysis to determine which problem features make it stand above the greedy approach, and is finally deployed on a number of problem instances built after realistic scenarios, corroborating the good performance of the heuristic.",2018
Adaptive Evolutionary Algorithm Based on a Cliqued Gibbs Sampling over Graphical Markov Model Structure,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000324600300008,"Ponce-de-Leon-Senti, EE and Diaz-Diaz, E","This chapter introduces Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) based on a learning strategy with two steps. The first step is based on the estimation of the searching sample complexity through an index based on the sample entropy. The searching sample algorithm learns a tree, and then, uses a sample complexity index to prognose the missing edges to obtain the cliques of the structure of the estimating distribution adding more edges if necessary. In the second step a new population is generated by a new cliqued Gibbs sampler (CG-Sampler) that drags through the space of solutions driven by the cliques of the learned graphical Markov model. Two variants of this algorithm are compared, the Adaptive Tree Cliqued - EDA (ATC-EDA) and the Adaptive Extended Tree Cliqued - EDA (AETC-EDA), and the Boltzmann selection procedure is used in CG-Sampler. They are tested with 5 known functions defined for 48, 50, 99 and 100 variables, and compared to Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm (UMDA).

Take Gaussian models as an example, EDAs based on single Gaussian distribution have good performance on solving simple unimodal functions and multimodal functions whose landscape has an obvious trend towards the global optimum. But they have difficulties in solving multimodal functions with irregular landscapes, such as wide basins, flat plateaus and deep valleys. Gaussian mixture model based EDAs have been developed to remedy this disadvantage of single Gaussian based EDAs. A general framework NichingEDA is presented in this paper from a new perspective to boost single model based EDAs' performance. Through adopting a niching method and recombination operators in a population of EDAs, NichingEDA significantly boosts the traditional single model based EDAs' performance by making use of the diversity inside the EDA population on hard problems without estimating a precise distribution. Our experimental studies have shown that NichingEDA is very effective for some hard global optimization problems, although its scalability to high dimensional functions needs improving.

Studying XCS/BOA learning in boolean functions: Structure encoding and random Boolean functions,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000249917300214,"Butz, MV and Pelikan, M","Recently, studies with the XCS classifier system on Boolean functions have shown that in certain types of functions simple crossover operators can lead to disruption and, consequently, a more effective recombination mechanism is required. Simple crossover operators were replaced by recombination based on estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). The combination showed that XCS with such a statistics-based crossover operator can solve challenging hierarchical functions more efficiently. This study elaborates the gained competence further investigating the coding scheme for the EDA component (BOA in our case) of XCS as well as performance in randomly generated Boolean function problems. Results in hierarchical Boolean functions show that the originally used 2-bit coding scheme induces a certain learning bias that stresses additional diversity in the evolving XCS population. A I-bit coding scheme as well as a restricted 2-bit coding scheme confirm the suspected bias. The alternative encodings decrease the unnecessary bias towards specificity and increase performance robustness. The paper concludes with a discussion on the challenges ahead for XCS in Boolean function problems as well as on the implications of the obtained results for real-valued and multiple-valued classification problems, multistep problems, and function approximation problems.",2006

Given the NP-hard complexity of SCIoT, Evolutionary Computation methods, especially Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs), have received increasing attention to solve SCIoT problems. As one of the most popular EDA methods, Population-Based Incremental Learning (PBIL) has demonstrated its strong competency in optimising composed services in SCIoT. However, conventional PBIL does not explicitly utilize problem knowledge such as QoS and service replication, limiting its effectiveness for IoT service composition. In this paper, we propose a new PBIL based approach, named Population-Based Incremental Learning to Improve Service Composition (PBILISC), to solve the SCIoT problem. Different from traditional PBIL, PBILISC seamlessly integrates PBIL with QoS-aware local search (QLS) to effectively handle replicated services in the SCIoT problem. Specifically, PBILISC evolves a series of populations of solutions jointly through PBIL and QLS. PBIL leverages a probability distribution for population updates, while QLS focuses on improving the best evolved solution by searching promising neighboring solutions under the guidance of QoS. Experimental results show that PBILISC can outperform PBIL and several state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmark SCIoT problems.",2024

The question is how good representations can be found and how they can be adapted online to account for what can be learned about the structure of the problem from previous samples. We address these questions in a scenario that we term indirect Estimation-of-Distribution: We consider a decorrelated search distribution (mutational variability) on a variable length genotype space. A one-to-one encoding onto the phenotype space then needs to induce an adapted phenotypic search distribution incorporating the dependencies between phenotypic variables that have been observed successful previously. Formalizing this in the framework of Estimation-of-Distribution Algorithms, an adapted phenotypic search distribution can be characterized as minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) to a population of previously selected samples (parents). The paper derives a relation between this KLD and the description length of the encoding, stating that compact representations provide a way to minimize the divergence.

The multi-population approach is used to locate multiple local optima which are useful to find the global optimal solution quickly to dynamic multimodal problems. The diffusion model is used to increase the diversity in a guided fashion, which makes the neighbor individuals of previous optimal solutions move gradually from the previous optimal solutions and enlarge the search space. This approach uses both the information of current population and the part history information of the optimal solutions. Finally experimental studies on the moving peaks benchmark are carried out to evaluate the proposed algorithm and compare the performance of MDUMDA and multi-population quantum swarm optimization (MQSO) from the literature.

They provide a semantics that enables a compact, declarative representation of a joint probability distribution over the variables of a domain by leveraging the conditional independencies among them. The representation consists of a directed acyclic graph that encodes the conditional independencies among the variables and a set of parameters that encodes conditional distributions. This representation has provided a basis for the development of algo-rithms for probabilistic reasoning (inference) and for learning probability distributions from data.

In this paper, we investigate whether algorithms from a subclass of estimation of distribution algorithms, the compact algorithms, exhibit structural bias. Our approach, justified in our earlier publications, is based on conducting experiments on a test function whose values are uniformly distributed in its domain. For the experiment, 81 combinations of compact algorithms and strategies of dealing with infeasible solutions have been selected as test cases. We have applied two approaches for determining the presence and severity of structural bias, namely an (existing) visual and an (updated) statistical (Anderson-Darling) test. Our results suggest that compact algorithms are more immune to structural bias than their counterparts maintaining explicit populations. Both tests indicate that strong structural bias is found only in the cBFO algorithm, regardless of the choice of strategy of dealing with infeasible solutions, and cPSO with mirror strategy. For other test cases, statistical and visual tests disagree on some cases classified as having mild or strong structural bias: the former one tends to make harsher decisions, thus needing further investigation.",2020

One of the key similarities between all of the DEUM algorithms proposed so far is that they all assume the interaction between variables in the problem to be pre-given. In other words, they do not learn the structure of Markov network, and assume that it is known in advance.

Generally, the performance of an EDA depends on the match between its driving probability distribution and the landscape of the problem being solved. Because most well-known EDAs, including CMA-ES, NES, and AMaLGaM, use a uni-modal search distribution, they have a high risk of getting trapped in local optima when a problem is multi-modal with a (moderate) number of relatively comparable modes. This risk could potentially be mitigated using niching methods that define multiple regions of interest where separate search distributions govern sub-populations. However, a key question is how to determine a suitable number of niches, especially in BBO. In this paper, we present a novel, adaptive niching approach that determines the niches through hierarchical clustering based on the correlation between the probability densities and fitness values of solutions. We test the performance of a combination of this niching approach with AMaLGaM on both new and well-known niching benchmark problems and find that the new approach properly identifies multiple landscape modes, leading to much better performance on multi-modal problems than with a non-niched, uni-modal EDA.y",2017

As linkage discovery can be considered a matter of information extraction, Shannon's entropy, a renowned metric, has been widely adopted in modern GAs. Despite the validation of theoretical bounds, which is not algorithm-specific, on evaluation complexity of linkage problems, a representative population sizing model for discrete EDAs has been developed based on the distribution of entropy measurement. On the other hand, though entropy metrics have been adopted in recent perturbation-based methods, relevant complexity analysis on these methods is still absent. In this article, we propose a population sizing model for a recently developed linkage identification method, called inductive linkage identification (ILI).

However, other authors have found Cauchy search distributions are less effective than Gaussian search distributions in high dimensional problems. In this paper, we set out to resolve this controversy. To achieve this we run extensive experiments on a battery of high-dimensional test functions, and develop some theory which shows that small search steps are always more likely to move the search distribution towards the global optimum than large ones and, in particular, large search steps in high-dimensional spaces do badly in this respect with high probability. We hypothesise that, since exploration by large steps is mostly counterproductive in high dimensions, and since the fraction of good directions decays exponentially fast with increasing dimension, instead one should focus mainly on finding the right direction in which to move the search distribution.

Thus, they do not allow for a straightforward application of traditional optimization techniques. In these settings, randomized search heuristics such as evolutionary algorithms are a popular choice because they are often assumed to exhibit some kind of resistance to noise. Empirical evidence suggests that some algorithms, such as estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) are robust against a scaling of the noise intensity, even without resorting to explicit noise-handling techniques such as resampling. In this paper, we want to support such claims with mathematical rigor. We introduce the concept of graceful scaling in which the run time of an algorithm scales polynomially with noise intensity. We study a monotone fitness function over binary strings with additive noise taken from a Gaussian distribution. We show that myopic heuristics cannot efficiently optimize the function under arbitrarily intense noise without any explicit noise-handling. Furthermore, we prove that using a population does not help.

Structural Coherence of Problem and Algorithm: An Analysis for EDAs on all 2-bit and 3-bit Problems,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000380444802013,"Brownlee, AEI, McCall, JAW and Christie, LA","Metaheuristics assume some kind of coherence between decision and objective spaces. Estimation of Distribution algorithms approach this by constructing an explicit probabilistic model of high fitness solutions, the structure of which is intended to reflect the structure of the problem. In this context, ""structure"" means the dependencies or interactions between problem variables in a probabilistic graphical model. There are many approaches to discovering these dependencies, and existing work has already shown that often these approaches discover ""unnecessary"" elements of structure - that is, elements which are not needed to correctly rank solutions. This work performs an exhaustive analysis of all 2 and 3 bit problems, grouped into classes based on mononotic invariance. It is shown in [1] that each class has a minimal Walsh structure that can be used to solve the problem. We compare the structure discovered by different structure learning approaches to the minimal Walsh structure for each class, with summaries of which interactions are (in) correctly identified. Our analysis reveals a large number of symmetries that may be used to simplify problem solving. We show that negative selection can result in improved coherence between discovered and necessary structure, and conclude with some directions for a general programme of study building on this work.",2015
Integrative Probabilistic Evolving Spiking Neural Networks Utilising Quantum Inspired Evolutionary Algorithm: A Computational Framework,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000274201700019,"Kasabov, N","Integrative evolving connectionist systems (iECOS) integrate principles from different levels of information processing in the brain, including cognitive-, neuronal-, genetic- and quantum, in their dynamic interaction over time. The paper introduces a new framework of iECOS called integrative probabilistic evolving spiking neural networks (ipSNN) that incorporate probability learning parameters. ipSNN utilize a quantum inspired evolutionary optimization algorithm to optimize the probability parameters as these algorithms belong to the class of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDA). Both spikes and input features in ipESNN are represented as quantum bits being in a superposition of two states (1 and 0) defined by a probability density function. This representation allows for the state of an entire ipESNN at any time to be represented probabilistically in a quantum bit register and probabilistically optimised until convergence using quantum gate operators and a fitness function. The proposed ipESNN is a promising framework for both engineering applications and brain data modeling as it offers faster and more efficient feature selection and model optimization in a large dimensional space in addition to revealing new knowledge that is not possible to obtain using other models.

It controls the complexity of the search distribution by thresholding correlation estimates as a means to approximate the prominent dependency structure among the search variables and discard irrelevant detail.|However, it is known that the correlation coefficient can only determine statistical dependence when the data distribution is Gaussian. In this paper, we develop a new variant of EDA-MCC called EDA-MCC-MI which uses mutual information (MI) estimates to determine dependencies between the search variables, replacing linear correlation. Our method is in a better position to determine the correct dependency structure than the EDA-MCC can do, simply because MI is zero if and only if the variables are independent, whereas a zero correlation does not imply independence in general. Empirical comparison results show that EDA-MCC-MI is never worse than EDA-MCC even when the search distribution is Gaussian. Our implementation employs a nonparametric MI estimator, hence it is easily extensible to any other, non-Gaussian search distribution.",2016

To get the preferable permutation of the interrelated parameters, Q-learning is combined to build and modify the probability models in EDA autonomously. By making use of the global optimization capability of EDA, the proposed EDA_Q can also solve the local minima problem in traditional Q-learning. On the other hand, with the learning agent, EDA_Q can evaluate the probability distribution model regularly without pre-designed structure and updating rule.

Firstly, we compare the selected variation operators in pairs, each operator with a modification of itself, in which we remove those elements related to the Pareto efficiency. Then, in a second experiment we compare among the selected operators, the variation operators used in the NSGA-II algorithm and the ones presented by the authors, PBCO and RBMO. In all the experiments the variation operators are incorporated in a well-known algorithm usually considered as a reference for making the comparisons, the NSGA-II algorithm. The experiments show that the Pareto based variation operators selected from the literature do not usually present a better behavior than their non-Pareto based versions; and none of them presents a better performance than the one reached by the variation operators defined by the authors, which were entirely built around the Pareto information of the individuals. These facts suggest that more effort should be placed in the design of variation operators devoted to multi-objective algorithms in order to achieve superior results to those obtained by means of general variation operators.

Compact genetic codes as a search strategy of evolutionary processes,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000230881900005,"Toussaint, M","The choice of genetic representation crucially determines the capability of evolutionary processes to find complex solutions in which many variables interact. The question is how good genetic representations can be found and how they can be adapted online to account for what can be learned about the structure of the problem from previous samples. We address these questions in a scenario that we term indirect Estimation-of-Distribution: We consider a decorrelated search distribution (mutational variability) on a variable length genotype space. A one-to-one encoding onto the phenotype space then needs to induce an adapted phenotypic variability incorporating the dependencies between phenotypic variables that have been observed successful previously. Formalizing this in the framework of Estimation-of-Distribution Algorithms, an adapted phenotypic variability can be characterized as minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence to a population of previously selected individuals (parents). Our core result is a relation between the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the description length of the encoding in the specific scenario, stating that compact codes provide a way to minimize this divergence. A proposed class of Compression Evolutionary Algorithms and preliminary experiments with an L-system compression scheme illustrate the approach. We also discuss the implications for the self-adaptive evolution of genetic representations on the basis of neutrality (sigma-evolution) towards compact codes.",2005

In the proposed algorithm, search space is divided into independent sub-regions by calculating the angle between the objective vector and the reference vector. The reference vectors can be used not only to decompose the original multi-objective optimization problem into a number of single-objective subproblems, but also to elucidate user preferences to target a preferred subset of the whole Pareto front (PF). In this respect, any single objective optimizers can be easily used in this algorithm framework. Inspired by the multi-objective estimation of distribution algorithms, covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) is involved in RPCMA-ES. A state-of-the-art optimizer for single-objective continuous functions is the CMA-ES, which has proven to be able to strike a good balance between the exploration and the exploitation of search space.

However, an aspect not yet widely addressed by the research reported in the literature is the lack of ability of the AlSs to deal effectively with building blocks (partial high-quality solutions coded in the antibody). The available AlSs present mechanisms for evolving the population that do not take into account the relationship among the variables of the problem, potentially causing the disruption of high-quality partial solutions. This paper proposes a novel AIS with abilities to identify and properly manipulate building blocks in optimization problems. Instead of using cloning and mutation to generate new individuals, our algorithm builds a probabilistic model representing the joint probability distribution of the promising solutions and, subsequently, uses this model for sampling new solutions. The probabilistic model used is a Bayesian network due to its capability of properly capturing the most relevant interactions among the variables. Therefore, our algorithm, called Bayesian Artificial Immune System (BAIS), represents a significant attempt to improve the performance of immune-inspired algorithms when dealing with building blocks, and hence to solve efficiently hard optimization problems with complex interactions among the variables.

A method of gesture segmentation based on a two-phase estimation of distribution algorithm is proposed according to the correlation among the positions of pixels. The method divides the solution of the problem based on evolutionary optimization into two phases, and uses different estimation of distribution algorithms in different phases. In the first phase, the probability model of candidates is formulated by a number of intervals given the fact that the positions of hand pixels distribute in several intervals. In the second phase, the probability model of candidates is built through a series of segments since the positions of hand pixels further distribute around curves. A series of pixels constituting a hand region are obtained based on sampling by the above probability models.

Additionally, the fuzzy singular perturbed model with multiple perturbation parameters can describe a nonlinear multiple time scale system more precisely than the one with a single perturbation param- eter. However, the concentrated control of interconnected fuzzy singular perturbed model can not achieve excellent performance due to the interconnection term. Sometimes the interconnection term, which can be regarded as the external disturbance, may even lead to divergence in the control system.

Imposing limits on the number of different assets that can be included in the investment transforms portfolio selection into an NP-complete mixed-integer quadratic optimization problem that is difficult to solve by standard methods. An implementation of the algorithm that employs a genetic algorithm with a set representation, an appropriately defined mutation operator and Random Assortment Recombination for crossover (RAR-GA) is compared with implementations using Simulated Annealing (SA) and various Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs). An empirical investigation of the performance of the portfolios selected with these different methods using financial data shows that RAR-GA and SA are superior to the implementations with EDAs in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.

The results show that the proposed algorithm was superior to the two-part encoding genetic algorithmin terms of minimizing the total traveling distance.

One of the most used methods for segmentation is thresholding which can be formulated as an optimization problem, and evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are alternatives commonly applied to solve it. Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) is a branch of EAs that explores the search space by building a probabilistic model, such as Bayesian Networks (BNs). In this article is proposed a BN-based EDA for multilevel image segmentation called BNMTH. The proposed approach iteratively selects the combination of thresholding techniques that permits to find the best configuration of thresholds for a digital image, exploring the inter-dependencies between the decision variables (thresholds) and the different techniques. BNMTH is applied over a set of benchmark images and the results of the segmentation are qualitatively analyzed by using the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), the Structure Similarity Index (SSIM) and the Feature Similarity Index (FSIM). Besides, a statistical analysis is provided to compare BNMTH with other state-of-the-art optimization algorithms. The results show that BNMTH is a competitive approach for image segmentation, providing accurate results in almost all the cases.

This optimization is performed in a distance domain for localizing changes in the optimal speed profile due to traffic conditions while driving. After departure, by taking the optimal speed profile and actual traffic conditions into consideration, the speed profile for a short term-to only the next location-is adapted. In order to reliably react to actual traffic conditions, additional points are interpolated into the long-term distance step and fine control of speeds at the additional points is established, which is based on a predictive model for estimating the spacing to the preceding vehicle.

In addition to that, to keep their memory consumption low, compact algorithms purposely employ simple probabilistic models that can be described with a small number of parameters. Despite their simplicity, compact algorithms have shown good performances on a broad range of benchmark functions and real-world problems. However, compact algorithms also come with some drawbacks, i.e. they tend to premature convergence and show poorer performance on non-separable problems.

Although near-decomposability is commonly seen in nature, we cannot assume the same occurs for optimization problems. Therefore, the existence of problems where these algorithms are not effective is also focus of research. Recent studies have argued that Multidimensional Knapsack Problems (MKPs) are examples of such cases.

These algorithms use a stochastic model to sample from as it happens for Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs), but the estimation of the model from the population is substituted by the direct update of model parameter through stochastic gradient descent. The two algorithms, SGD and SNDG, both use statistical models in the exponential family, but they differ in the use of the natural gradient, first proposed in the literature by Amari [5], in the context of Information Geometry. Due to the properties of the exponential family, both gradient and natural gradient can be evaluated in terms of covariances between the fitness function and the sufficient statistics of the exponential family.

This algorithm has already been applied successfully to solve different kinds of scheduling problems. However, due to the fact that its probabilistic model does not consider variable interactions, ACGA may not perform well in some scheduling problems, particularly if sequence dependent setup times are considered. This is due to the fact that the previous job will influence the processing time of the next job. Simply capturing ordinal information from the parental distribution is not sufficient for a probabilistic model. As a result, this paper proposes a bi-variate probabilistic model to add into the ACGA. This new algorithm is called the ACGA2 and is used to solve single machine scheduling problems with sequence-dependent setup times in a common due-date environment. A theoretical analysis is given in this paper. Some heuristics and local search algorithm variable neighborhood search (VNS) are also employed in the ACGA2. The results indicate that the average error ratio of this ACGA2 is half the error ratio of the ACGA. In addition, when ACGA2 is applied in combination with other heuristic methods and VNS, the hybrid algorithm achieves optimal solution quality in comparison with other algorithms in the literature.

In such problems, adaptive, self-organizing agent approaches have been shown to provide very robust solutions. However, these approaches often require non-trivial amounts of time to respond to large environmental shifts. Considering this limitation, we observe that environmental changes in a given dynamic problem are generally not completely random; similar states in the environment tend to reappear over time. Memory is one way to leverage this past information and improve the adaptive efficiency of the agent system. In this paper, we explore the use of memory as a means of boosting the performance of self-organizing agents in solving dynamic coordination problems.

EDAs have been successfully applied to many real-world problems; however, whether their models indicate the optimal way to decompose the given problem is rarely studied. This paper proposes using the number of function evaluations (N-fe) as the performance measure of EDA models. As a result, the optimal model can be defined as the one that consumes the fewest N-fe on average for EDAs to solve a specific problem. Based on this concept, correct building blocks (BBs) can be defined as groups of genes that construct the optimal model. Similarly, linkages within a BB are defined as the correct linkages of which the specific problem consists. The capabilities of four commonly used linkage-learning metrics, nonlinearity, entropy, simultaneity and differential mutual complement, are investigated based on the above definitions. For certain partially separable problems, none of the above metrics yields difference that is statistically significant between linear and nonlinear gene pairs. Although an optimal threshold still exists to separate linear and nonlinear gene pairs, most existing EDA designs today have not yet characterize such threshold. Based on the idea of N-fe estimation, this paper also proposes a metric enhancer, named eNFE, to enhance existing linkage-learning techniques. Empirical results show that eNFE improves BB identification by eliminating spurious linkages which occur often in most existing EDAs. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",2013
Machine learning enhancing metaheuristics: a systematic review,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:001037116500001,"Oliveira, ALD, Britto, A and Gusmao, R","During the optimization process, a large number of data are generated through the search. Machine learning techniques and algorithms can be used to handle the generated data to contribute to the optimization process. The use of machine learning enhancing metaheuristics applied to optimization problems has been drawing attention due to their capacity to add domain knowledge during the search process. This knowledge can accelerate metaheuristics and lead to better and promising solutions. This work provides a systematic literature review of machine learning enhancing metaheuristics and summarizes the current state of the classification of the research field, main techniques and machine learning models, validations strategies, and real-world optimization problems that the approach was applied. Our keyword search found 1.960 papers, published in the last 10 years. After considering the inclusion and exclusion criteria and performing backward snowballing procedure, we have analyzed 111 primary studies. The results show the predominance of the use of surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) for improving the efficiency of the optimization, and the use of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) to increase the effectiveness of the optimization. The objective function value is the mostly applied evaluating criteria to validate the algorithm with other methods. The developed techniques of the studies found are applied in diverse real-world applications such as developing machine learning models, physics simulations with expensive function evaluation, and the variants of the classical job shop scheduling problem. We also discuss trends and opportunities of the research field.",2023
The estimation of distributions and the minimum relative entropy principle,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000227633700003,"Mühlenbein, H and Höns, R","Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDA) have been proposed as an extension of genetic algorithms. In this paper we explain the relationship of EDA to algorithms developed in statistics, artificial intelligence, and statistical physics. The major design issues are discussed within a general interdisciplinary framework. It is shown that maximum entropy approximations play a crucial role. All proposed algorithms try to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence KLD between the unknown distribution p(x) and a class q(x) of approximations. However, the Kullback-Leibler divergence is not symmetric. Approximations which suppose that the function to be optimized is additively decomposed (ADF) minimize KLD(q vertical bar vertical bar p), the methods which learn the approximate model from data minimize KLD(p vertical bar vertical bar q). This minimization is identical to maximizing the log-likelihood. In the paper three classes of algorithms are discussed. FDA uses the ADF to compute an approximate factorization of the unknown distribution. The factors are marginal distributions, whose values are computed from samples. The second class is represented by the Bethe-Kikuchi approach which has recently been rediscovered in statistical physics. Here the values of the marginals are computed from a difficult constrained minimization problem. The third class learns the factorization from the data. We analyze our learning algorithm LFDA in detail. It is shown that learning is faced with two problems: first, to detect the important dependencies between the variables, and second, to create an acyclic Bayesian network of bounded clique size.",2005
Linkage identification for real-valued loci by fitness difference classification,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000232173100176,"Tsuji, M, Munetomo, M and Akama, K","In order to enhance efficiency of genetic algorithms, it is important to identify a linkage set, i.e. a set of loci tightly linked to construct a building block. In this paper, we propose a novel linkage identification method for real-valued strings called the real-valued Dependency Detection for Distribution Derived from df (rD(5)). It can detect linkage sets with quasi-linear fitness evaluations. The rD(5) is designed based on the D-5 which has been proposed for binary strings. It detects dependencies of loci by estimating the distribution of strings classified according to fitness differences. The rD(5) and the LINC-R which is one of linkage identification methods proposed elsewhere, provide approximate equivalent information about a function to be solved, however, the rD(5) performs smaller number of fitness evaluations than the LINC-R for larger functions. Although estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) also estimate distribution of strings, it is difficult for EDAs to solve a function composed of exponentially scaled sub-functions. The proposed method, by contrast, can be applied to the function in the similar way to as to a function composed of uniformly scaled sub-functions which is easy for EDAs. We perform experiments to compare the proposed method with the LINC-R and to examine the scaling effect stability of the rD(5). We also investigate two parameters, that define the amount of perturbation (mutation) and that define the quantization level.",2005
Multi-objective optimization based on an improved cross-entropy method.

One of the main advantages of EDAs is that the fusion of prior information into the optimization procedure is straightforward, thereby reducing convergence time when such information is available. This study presents the modified Multi-Objective Cross-Entropy (MOCE+) method, based on a new procedure for addressing constraints: (i) the use of variable cutoff values for selecting the elitist population; and, (ii) filtering of the elitist population after each epoch. We study the proposed method in different test suites and compare its performance with some other well-known optimization methods. The comparative study demonstrates the good figures of merit of the MOCE+ method in complex test suites. Finally, the proposed method is applied to the multi-objective optimization of a micro-drilling process. Two conflicting targets are considered: total drilling time and vibrations on the plane that is perpendicular to the drilling axis. The Pareto front, obtained through the optimization process, is analyzed through quality metrics and the available options in the decision-making process. Overall, the quality metrics of the MOCE+ method were better than the metrics of the other optimization methods considered in this work. The reported optimization of the micro-drilling process with the proposed method could potentially have a direct impact on improvements in industrial efficiency. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The Benefit of Recombination in Noisy Evolutionary Search,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000383741800081,"Friedrich, T, Kötzing, T, Sutton, AM","Practical optimization problems frequently include uncertainty about the quality measure, for example due to noisy evaluations. Thus, they do not allow for a straightforward application of traditional optimization techniques. In these settings, randomized search heuristics such as evolutionary algorithms are a popular choice because they are often assumed to exhibit some kind of resistance to noise. Empirical evidence suggests that some algorithms, such as estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) are robust against a scaling of the noise intensity, even without resorting to explicit noise-handling techniques such as resampling.|In this paper, we want to support such claims with mathematical rigor. We introduce the concept of graceful scaling in which the run time of an algorithm scales polynomially with noise intensity. We study a monotone fitness function over binary strings with additive noise taken from a Gaussian distribution. We show that myopic heuristics cannot efficiently optimize the function under arbitrarily intense noise without any explicit noise-handling. Furthermore, we prove that using a population does not help. Finally we show that a simple EDA called the Compact Genetic Algorithm can overcome the shortsightedness of mutation-only heuristics to scale gracefully with noise. We conjecture that recombinative genetic algorithms also have this property.|This extended abstract summarizes our work ""The Benefit of Recombination in Noisy Evolutionary Search,"" which appeared in Proceedings of International Symposium on Algorithms and Computation (ISAAC), 2015, pp.140-150.",2016
Analyzing the k Most Probable Solutions in EDAs Based on Bayesian Networks,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000277912300008,"Echegoyen, C, Mendiburu, A, Lozano, JA","Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) have been successfully applied to a wide variety of problems but, for the most complex approaches, there is no clear understanding of the way these algorithms complete the search. For that reason, in this work we exploit the probabilistic models that EDAs based on Bayesian networks are able to learn in order to provide new information about their behavior. Particularly, we analyze the k solutions with the highest probability in the distributions estimated during the search. In order to study the relationship between the probabilistic model and the fitness function, we focus on calculating, for the k most probable solutions (MPSs), the probability values, the function values and the correlation between both sets of values at each step of the algorithm. Furthermore, the objective functions of the k MPSs are contrasted with the k best individuals in the population. We complete the analysis by calculating the position of the optimum in the k MPSs during the search and the genotypic diversity of these solutions. We carry out the analysis by optimizing functions of different natures such as Trap5, two variants of Ising spin glass and Max-SAT. The results not only show information about the relationship between the probabilistic model and the fitness function, but also allow us to observe characteristics of the search space, the quality of the setup of the parameters and even distinguish between successful and unsuccessful runs.",2010
A Classification-Based Model for Multi-Objective Hyperspectral Sparse Unmixing,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000505701800009,"Xu, X, Shi, ZW, Li, XL","Sparse unmixing has become a popular tool for hyperspectral imagery interpretation. It refers to finding the optimal subset of a spectral library to reconstruct the image data and further estimate the proportions of different materials. Recently, multi-objective based sparse unmixing methods have presented promising performance because of their advantages in addressing combinatorial problems. A spectral and multi-objective based sparse unmixing (SMoSU) algorithm was proposed in our previous work, which solves the decision-making problem well. However, it does not show outstanding advantages in strong noise cases. To solve the problem, in this paper, SMoSU is improved based on the estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). The machine learning based EDAs have been a reliable approach in solving multi-objective problems. However, most of them are for special problems and relatively weak in theoretical foundations. Thus, it is unreliable to extend it directly to sparse unmixing. Here, we improve EDA on the basis of classification and propose a classification-based model for individual generating under the framework of SMoSU (CM-MoSU). In CM-MoSU, the whole population is divided to be positive and negative. Then, the macroinformation of positive individuals is used to guide the generation of new individuals. Therefore, the optimization task could pay more attention to the feasible space with high quality. Moreover, some theoretical analyses are presented to prove the reliability of CM-MoSU. In experiments, several state-of-the-art sparse unmixing algorithms are compared. Both synthetic and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CM-MoSU.",2019
R-EVO: A Reactive Evolutionary Algorithm for the Maximum Clique Problem,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000297586200002,"Brunato, M and Battiti, R","An evolutionary algorithm with guided mutation (EA/G) has been proposed recently for solving the maximum clique problem. In the framework of estimation-of-distribution algorithms, guided mutation uses a model distribution to generate offspring by combining the local information of solutions found so far with global statistical information. Each individual is then subjected to a Marchiori's repair heuristic, based on randomized extraction and greedy expansion, to ensure that it represents a legal clique. A novel reactive and evolutionary algorithm (R-EVO) proposed in this paper starts from the same evolutionary framework but considers more complex individuals, which modify tentative solutions by local search with memory, according to the reactive search optimization (RSO) principles. In particular, the estimated distribution is used to periodically initialize the state of each individual based on the previous statistical knowledge extracted from the population. We demonstrate that the combination of the estimation-of-distribution concept with RSO produces significantly better results than EA/G for many test instances and it is remarkably robust with respect to the setting of the algorithm parameters. R-EVO adopts a drastically simplified low-knowledge version of reactive local search (RLS), with a simple internal diversification mechanism based on tabu-search, with a prohibition parameter proportional to the estimated best clique size. R-EVO is competitive with the more complex full-knowledge RLS-EVO that adopts the original RLS algorithm. For most of the benchmark instances, the hybrid scheme version produces significantly better results than EA/G for comparable or a smaller central processing unit time.",2011

On the one hand, it is presented in Sect. 10.1 a new family of cellular GAs in which a hierarchy is established inside the population such that better individuals are moved to the same region of the grid. This way, a faster convergence of the best individuals is promoted, while the diversity is maintained in locations far away from this region. This new hierarchical cellular model is applied here to GAs, but it can be implemented in any other family of EA. It can be helpful in parallel implementations looking for fail tolerance, since some parts of the population could be lost with negligible effects on the search. Also, faster convergence can be an interesting outcome of this new mode.|On the other hand, a new class of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) is addressed in Sect. 10.2. This new family of algorithms is known as cellular EDAs (cEDAs), and they are characterized by their decentralized population, which is partitioned into many small collaborating sub-populations, arranged in a toroidal grid, and interacting only with its neighboring sub-populations.|These two new families of cellular models are analyzed and compared in this chapter against their equivalent panmictic algorithms from the points of view of both theory and practice.",2008
Re-sampled inheritance compact optimization,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000582515800001,"Iacca, G and Caraffini, F","Compact optimization is an alternative paradigm in the field of metaheuristics requiring a modest use of memory to optimize a problem. As opposed to population-based algorithms, which conduct the search by employing a set of candidate solutions, compact algorithms use a probabilistic model to describe how solutions are distributed over the search space. Compared to other Estimation of Distribution Algorithms, peculiar features such as the use of simple probabilistic models, in which variables are treated independently, and the need for a minimal number of solutions to be sampled to perform the search, make these algorithms suitable for those applications plagued by memory limitations. Compact algorithms show good results on different kinds of optimization problems but often prematurely converge and perform poorly on non-separable. In this paper, we attempt to overcome these limitations by combining compact algorithms with a restart mechanism named Re-Sampled Inheritance (RI) whose purpose is to avoid premature convergence while also inheriting parts of the variables from the best solution found so far. To assess the effect of the RI mechanism, we extensively test various existing compact algorithms, with and without RI, and compare the best RI-based compact algorithm against several competing algorithms on several optimization problems at different dimensionalities. We also evaluate the effect of the RI parameters on the overall algorithmic performance. Our numerical results not only show that RI consistently enhances the performances of compact algorithms, but also shed some light on the effectiveness of different compact logics at handling problems at different dimensionalities.

Many of the real-world problems can be decomposed into a number of sub-problems which may be solved easier. Appropriate decomposition is a significant issue specially for optimization problems where the optimal solution is usually obtained by combining the solutions of sub-problems. Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) are a type of evolutionary algorithms that learn a model of problem from the population of candidate solutions.|This model is intended to capture the interactions between problem variables, thus facilitating problem decomposition and is used to generate new solutions. In this paper, a novel type of problems is presented that is designed to challenge the model building process in discrete EDAs. The main idea is to propose a set of problems that their candidate solutions can be simultaneously decomposed into different sub-problems. This means that the candidate solution of a problem may be interpreted by two or more different structure where only one is true, resulting in the optimal solution to that problem. Some of these decompositions or structures may be more likely according to the low-order statistics collected from the population of candidate solutions, but may not necessarily lead to the optimal solution. Learning the correct structure/decomposition is a challenge for the model building process in EDA. The experimental results show that the proposed problems are indeed difficult for EDAs even when expressive models such as Bayesian networks are used to capture the interactions in the problem.",2016
A hyper-heuristic guided by a probabilistic graphical model for single-objective real-parameter optimization,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000836759100002,"Oliva, D, Martins, MSR, Mousavirad, SJ","Metaheuristics algorithms are designed to find approximate solutions for challenging optimization problems. The success of the algorithm over a given optimization task relies on the suitability of its search heuristics for the problem-domain. Thus, the design of custom metaheuristic algorithms leads to more accurate solutions. Hyper-heuristics (HH) are important tools commonly used to select low-level heuristics (LLHs) to solve a specific problem. HH are able to acquire knowledge from the problems where they are used. However, as other artificial intelligence tools it is necessary to identify how the knowledge affects the performance of the algorithm. One way to generate such knowledge is to capture interactions between variables using probabilistic graphical models such as Bayesian networks (BN) in conjunction with estimation of distribution algorithms (EDA). This article presents a method based on that used an EDA based on BN as a high-level selection mechanism for HH called Hyper-heuristic approach based on Bayesian learning and evolutionary operators (HHBNO). Here the knowledge is extracted form BN to evolve the sequences of LLHs in an online learning process by exploring the inter-dependencies among the LLHs. The proposes approach is tested over CEC'17 set of benchmark function of single-objective real-parameter optimization. Statical tests verifies that the HHBNO presents competitive results in comparison with other metaheuristic algorithms with high performance in terms of convergence.

Biasing Bayesian Optimization Algorithm using Case Based Reasoning,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000295244800013,"Kaedi, M and Ghasem-Aghaee, N","Studies show that application of the prior knowledge in biasing the Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs), such as Bayesian Optimization Algorithm (BOA), increases the efficiency of these algorithms significantly. One of the main advantages of the EDAs over other optimization algorithms is that the former provides a trail of probabilistic models of candidate solutions with increasing quality. Some recent studies have applied these probabilistic models, obtained from previously solved problems in biasing the BOA algorithm, to solve the future problems. In this paper, in order to improve the previous works and reduce their disadvantages, a method based on Case Based Reasoning (CBR) is proposed for biasing the BOA algorithm. Herein, after running BOA for solving optimization problems, each problem, the corresponding solution, as well as the last Bayesian network obtained from the BOA algorithm, will be stored as an entry in the case-base. Upon introducing a new problem, similar problems from the case-base are retrieved and the last Bayesian networks of these solved problems are combined according to the degree of their similarity with the new problem; hence, a compound Bayesian network is constructed. The compound Bayesian network is sampled and the initial population for the BOA algorithm is generated. This network will be applied efficiently for biasing future probabilistic models during the runs of BOA for the new problem. The proposed method is tested on three well-known combinatorial benchmark problems. Experimental results show significant improvements in algorithm execution time and quality of solutions, compared to previous methods. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2011

It can detect the correlation between multiple variables and extract knowledge on regular patterns in solutions. Bayesian Networks (BNs) are used in BOA to represent the probability distributions of the best individuals. The BN's construction is challenging since there is a trade-off between acuity and computational cost to generate it. This trade-off is determined by combining a search algorithm (SA) and a scoring metric (SM). The SA is responsible for generating a promising BN and the SM assesses the quality of such networks. Some studies have already analyzed how this relationship affects the learning process of a BN. However, such investigation had not yet been performed to determine the bond linking the selection of SA and SM and the BOA's output quality. Acting on this research gap, a detailed comparative analysis involving two constructive heuristics and four scoring metrics is presented in this work. The classic version of BOA was applied to discrete and continuous optimization problems using binary and floating-point representations. The scenarios were compared through graphical analyses, statistical metrics, and difference detection tests. The results showed that the selection of SA and SM affects the quality of the BOA results since scoring metrics that penalize complex BN models perform better than metrics that do not consider the complexity of the networks.

A state-of-the-art optimizer for single-objective continuous functions that also uses probabilistic modeling is the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES). Different variants of CMA-ES have been proposed for MOPs however most of them are based on Pareto dominance as the main selection criterion. Recently, a new multi-objective CMA-ES called MOEA/D-CMA was proposed combining the strengths of CMA-ES with those of the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D). Nowadays, however, researchers on MOEAs agree that combining Pareto and decomposition can be beneficial for the search on MOPs. As a result, a new MOEA has been proposed, called MOEA/DD. This algorithm modifies the MOEA/D by including a new Pareto dominance update mechanism that brings more diversity into the search. In this study, we extend the MOEA/D-CMA by replacing its update mechanism by the one of MOEA/DD. The hypothesis is that this update mechanism will improve the performance of MOEA/D-CMA as it improved MOEA/D. MOEA/D-CMA and MOEA/DD-CMA are implemented and evaluated through an experimental study.

Symbolic modeling of epistasis,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000244256500007,"Moore, JH, Barney, N, White, BC","The workhorse of modern genetic analysis is the parametric linear model. The advantages of the linear modeling framework are many and include a mathematical understanding of the model fitting process and ease of interpretation. However, an important limitation is that linear models make assumptions about the nature of the data being modeled. This assumption may not be realistic for complex biological systems such as disease susceptibility where nonlinearities in the genotype to phenotype mapping relationship that result from epistasis, plastic reaction norms, locus heterogeneity, and phenocopy, for example, are the norm rather than the exception. We have previously developed a flexible modeling approach called symbolic discriminant analysis (SDA) that makes no assumptions about the patterns in the data. Rather, SDA lets the data dictate the size, shape, and complexity of a symbolic discriminant function that could include any set of mathematical functions from a list of candidates supplied by the user. Here, we outline a new five step process for symbolic model discovery that uses genetic programming (GP) for coarse-grained stochastic searching, experimental design for parameter optimization, graphical modeling for generating expert knowledge, and estimation of distribution algorithms for fine-grained stochastic searching. Finally, we introduce function mapping as a new method for interpreting symbolic discriminant functions. We show that function mapping when combined with measures of interaction information facilitates statistical interpretation by providing a graphical approach to decomposing complex models to highlight synergistic, redundant, and independent effects of polymorphisms and their composite functions. We illustrate this five step SDA modeling process with a real case-control dataset. Copyright (c) 2007 S. Karger AG, Basel.",2007

The Gaussian distribution is commonly used as a search operator in most of the EDA methods. However there are indications in the literature that heavy tailed distributions may perform better due to their higher exploration capabilities. Univariate heavy tailed distributions were already proposed for high dimensional problems. In 2D problems it has been reported that a multivariate heavy tailed (such as Cauchy) search distribution is able to blend together the strengths of multivariate modelling with a high exploration power. In this paper, we study whether a similar scheme would work well in high dimensional search problems. To get around of the difficulty of multivariate model building in high dimensions we employ a recently proposed random projections (RP) ensemble based approach which we modify to get samples from a multivariate Cauchy using the scale-mixture representation of the Cauchy distribution. Our experiments show that the resulting RP-based multivariate Cauchy EDA consistently improves on the performance of the univariate Cauchy search distribution. However, intriguingly, the RP-based multivariate Gaussian EDA has the best performance among these methods. It appears that the highly explorative nature of the multivariate Cauchy sampling is exacerbated in high dimensional search spaces and the population based search loses its focus and effectiveness as a result. Finally, we present an idea to increase exploration while maintaining exploitation and focus by using the RP-based multivariate Gaussian EDA in which the RP matrices are drawn with i.i.d. heavy tailed entries. This achieves improved performance and is competitive with the state of the art.",2014

These subgroups provide clues about the main biological processes. Until now, different approaches to this problem have been proposed. Most of them use the mean squared residue as quality measure but relevant and interesting patterns can not be detected such as shifting, or scaling patterns. Furthermore, recent papers show that there exist new coherence patterns involved in different kinds of cancer and tumors such as inverse relationships between genes which can not be captured.|Results: The proposed measure is called Spearman's biclustering measure (SBM) which performs an estimation of the quality of a bicluster based on the non-linear correlation among genes and conditions simultaneously. The search of biclusters is performed by using a evolutionary technique called estimation of distribution algorithms which uses the SBM measure as fitness function. This approach has been examined from different points of view by using artificial and real microarrays. The assessment process has involved the use of quality indexes, a set of bicluster patterns of reference including new patterns and a set of statistical tests. It has been also examined the performance using real microarrays and comparing to different algorithmic approaches such as Bimax, CC, OPSM, Plaid and xMotifs. Conclusions: SBM shows several advantages such as the ability to recognize more complex coherence patterns such as shifting, scaling and inversion and the capability to selectively marginalize genes and conditions depending on the statistical significance.

Nature-inspired Approaches for Distance Metric Learning in Multivariate Time Series Classification,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000426929700258,"Oregi, I, Del Ser, J, Lozano, JA","The applicability of time series data mining in many different fields has motivated the scientific community to focus on the development of new methods towards improving the performance of the classifiers over this particular class of data. In this context the related literature has extensively shown that dynamic time warping is the similarity measure of choice when univariate time series are considered. However, possible statistical coupling among different dimensions make the generalization of this metric to the multivariate case all but obvious. This has ignited the interest of the community in new distance definitions capable of capturing such inter-dimension dependences. In this paper we propose a simple dynamic time warping based distance that finds the best weighted combination between the dependent - where multivariate time series are treated as whole - and independent approaches - where multivariate time series are just a collection of unrelated univariate time series - of the time series to be classified. A benchmark of four heuristic wrappers, namely, simulated annealing, particle swarm optimization, estimation of distribution algorithms and genetic algorithms are used to evolve the set of weighting coefficients towards maximizing the cross-validated predictive score of the classifiers. In this context one of the most recurring classifiers is nearest neighbor. This classifier is couple with a distance that as afore mentioned, in most cases, have been dynamic time warping. The performance of the proposed approach is validated over datasets widely utilized in the related literature, from which it is concluded that the obtained performance gains can be enlarged by properly decoupling the influence of each dimension in the definition of the dependent dynamic time warping distance.",2017
Animal communication of fear and safety related to foraging behavior and fitness: An individual-based modeling approach,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000497253700009,"Bhattacharjee, S, MacPherson, B, Gras, R","Animal communication impacts many kinds of behavior including mating and courtship, escaping from predators and foraging activity. In this article, our investigation focuses primarily on how alarm communication impacts foraging activity, using individual based computer simulations. We used this approach to help resolve a debate in the literature between the risk-allocation hypothesis, which predicts that over time, animals become habituated to alarm communication versus the hypothesis that alarm communication consistently decreases foraging activity to avoid predators. We found that in most cases, alarm communication did indeed decrease foraging activity whereas in other cases, alarm communication resulted in habituation and a gradual increase in foraging activity, suggesting that there is some truth to both hypotheses. Moreover, it is possible that a decrease in foraging as well as habituation in response to alarm communication both contribute to fitness, or more generally, that alarm communication contributes to fitness as opposed to non-communication. Among the communication runs, we found that although there were higher levels of fitness compared with non-communication runs, fitness was higher when communication results in decreased foraging activity vs. runs where communication results in increased foraging activity. Finally, we used a variational autoencoder based estimation of distribution algorithms in conjuction with C4.5 decision trees as a wrapper to discern the features that distinguish communication runs from non-communication runs. In general, communication runs tend to have relatively low population densities, whereas non-communication runs tend to have relatively high population densities, suggesting that the ability to communicate fear obviates the need for prey to stay in close proximity to one another in order to defend against predators. Also a high level of reproductive urgency was observed in individuals with communication ability when the level of fear of predators was low.",2019
Working principles of binary differential evolution,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000501614300006,"Doerr, B and Zheng, WJ","We conduct a first fundamental analysis of the working principles of binary differential evolution (BDE), an optimization heuristic for binary decision variables that was derived by Gong and Tuson (2007) from the very successful classic differential evolution (DE) for continuous optimization. We show that unlike most other optimization paradigms, it is stable in the sense that neutral bit values are sampled with probability close to 1/2 for a long time. This is generally a desirable property, however, it makes it harder to find the optima for decision variables with small influence on the objective function. This can result in an optimization time exponential in the dimension when optimizing simple symmetric functions like OneMax. On the positive side, BDE quickly detects and optimizes the most important decision variables. For example, dominant bits converge to the optimal value in time logarithmic in the population size. This enables BDE to optimize the most important bits very fast. Overall, our results indicate that BDE is an interesting optimization paradigm having characteristics significantly different from classic evolutionary algorithms or estimation-of-distribution algorithms (EDAs).|On the technical side, we observe that the strong stochastic dependencies in the random experiment describing a run of BDE prevent us from proving all desired results with the mathematical rigor that was successfully used in the analysis of other evolutionary algorithms. Inspired by mean-field approaches in statistical physics we propose a more independent variant of BDE, show experimentally its similarity to BDE, and prove some statements rigorously only for the independent variant. Such a semi-rigorous approach might be interesting for other problems in evolutionary computation where purely mathematical methods failed so far. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2020
Elitism-based compact genetic algorithms,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000184819400004,"Ahn, CW and Ramakrishna, RS","This paper describes two elitism-based compact genetic algorithms (cGAs)-persistent elitist compact genetic algorithm (pe-cGA), and nonpersistent elitist compact genetic algorithm (ne-cGA). The aim is to design efficient compact-type GAs by treating them as estimation of distribution algorithms ( I EDAs) for solving difficult optimization problems without compromising on memory and computation costs. The idea is to deal with issues connected with lack of memory-inherent disadvantage of cGAs-by allowing a selection pressure that is high enough to offset the disruptive effect of uniform crossover. The point is to properly reconcile the cGA with elitism. The pe-cGA finds a near optimal solution (i.e., a winner) that is maintained as long as other solutions (i.e., competitors) generated from probability vectors are no better. It attempts to adaptively alter the selection pressure according to the degree of problem difficulty by employing only the pair-wise tournament selection strategy. Moreover, it incorporates the equivalent model of the (1 + 1) evolution strategy (ES) with self-adaptive mutation. The pe-cGA, apart from providing a high performance, also reveals the hidden connection between EDAs (e.g., cGA) and ESs (e.g., (1 + 1)-ES). On the other hand, the ne-cGA further improves the performance of the pe-cGA by, avoiding strong elitism that may lead to premature convergence. The ne-cGA comes with all the benefits of the pe-cGA. In addition, it maintains genetic diversity as a bonus. This paper also proposes an analytic model for investigating convergence enhancement (i.e., speedup).|Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms, ne-cGA in particular, generally exhibit a better quality of solution and a higher rate of convergence for most of the problems than do the existing cGA, sGA, and (1 + 1) -ES. The speedup model has been verified by experiments. The results also show that an adequate alleviation of elitism further improves the solution quality, as well as the convergence speed.",2003
Bayesian Optimization Algorithm Applied to Uncertainty Quantification,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000309147700017,"Abdollahzadeh, A, Reynolds, A, Williams, G","Prudent decision making in subsurface assets requires reservoir uncertainty quantification. In a typical uncertainty-quantification study, reservoir models must be updated using the observed response from the reservoir by a process known as history matching. This involves solving an inverse problem, finding reservoir models that produce, under simulation, a similar response to that of the real reservoir. However, this requires multiple expensive multiphase-flow simulations. Thus, uncertainty-quantification studies employ optimization techniques to find acceptable models to be used in prediction. Different optimization algorithms and search strategies are presented in the literature, but they are generally unsatisfactory because of slow convergence to the optimal regions of the global search space, and, more importantly, failure in finding multiple acceptable reservoir models. In this context, a new approach is offered by estimation-of-distribution algorithms (EDAs). EDAs are population-based algorithms that use models to estimate the probability distribution of promising solutions and then generate new candidate solutions.|This paper explores the application of EDAs, including univariate and multivariate models. We discuss two histogram-based univariate models and one multivariate model, the Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA), which employs Bayesian networks for modeling. By considering possible interactions between variables and exploiting explicitly stored knowledge of such interactions, EDAs can accelerate the search process while preserving search diversity. Unlike most existing approaches applied to uncertainty quantification, the Bayesian network allows the BOA to build solutions using flexible rules learned from the models obtained, rather than fixed rules, leading to better solutions and improved convergence. The BOA is naturally suited to finding good solutions in complex high-dimensional spaces, such as those typical in reservoir-uncertainty quantification.|We demonstrate the effectiveness of EDA by applying the well-known synthetic PUNQ-S3 case with multiple wells. This allows us to verify the methodology in a well-controlled case. Results show better estimation of uncertainty when compared with some other traditional population-based algorithms.",2012
Microgrids energy management considering net-zero energy concept: The role of renewable energy landscaping design and IoT modeling in digital twin realistic simulator,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:001178584200001,"Wu, P and Mei, XQ","The research at hand leverages an affordable Intelligent Communication System (ICS) integrated with the Internet of Things (IoT) to implement an Optimum Energy Management Program (EMP) for a unified system comprising photovoltaics (PVs), biogases, and Vanadium Redox Flow Battery storage (VRFBS) within a Smart Islanded Hybrid Microgrid (HMG) network. The proposed EMP and control framework are structured around four essential components: (i) Real-time Energy Data Collection: Inexpensive energy meters gather energy data from various renewable sources, VRFBS, utility, and loads, ensuring comprehensive real-time monitoring. (ii) Monitoring and Control: MODBUS on TCP/IP and Raspberry-Pi platforms facilitate monitoring, control, and fault detection, ensuring seamless operation and fault mitigation. (iii) Cloud-Enabled Remote Monitoring: The system employs Message Alignment Telemetry Transference (MATT) servers and ThingSpeak Middleware to establish a Cloud-enabled Remote Monitoring Unit (RMU), enhancing accessibility and remote monitoring capabilities. (iv) Biogas and VRFBS Control: The system measures biogas generation and automates control of biogas engine generators, while enabling scheduled modifications of VRFBS requisition, ensuring optimal energy utilization. An integrated Hybrid Microgrid, comprising a 10 kWP PV system, a 15kVA biogas unit, and a 6 kWh VRFBS, has been designed to efficiently manage energy requisition and prevent power losses during dynamic load profiles. This configuration validates the efficacy of the proposed ICS. The EMP's performance is rigorously evaluated across three distinct scenarios, demonstrating its ability to utilize PV power during daytime outages and support critical loads by connecting biogas power generators during grid outages. The modelled IoT sensors and renewable landscape design within the digital twin simulator enhance the system's predictive capabilities and decision-making processes. This study marks a significant advancement, presenting a cost-effective and versatile solution through Smart Islanded Hybrid Microgrids.

Real-Coded Bayesian Optimization Algorithm  Bringing the Strength of BOA into the Continuous World,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000225101200086,"Ahn, CW, Ramakrishna, RS and Goldberg, DE","This paper describes a continuous estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) to solve decomposable, real-valued optimization problems quickly, accurately, and reliably. This is the real-coded Bayesian optimization algorithm (rBOA). The objective is to bring the strength of (discrete) BOA to bear upon the area of real-valued optimization. That is, the rBOA must properly decompose a problem, efficiently fit each subproblem, and effectively exploit the results so that correct linkage learning even on nonlinearity and probabilistic building-block crossover (PBBC) are performed for real-valued multivariate variables. The idea is to perform a Bayesian factorization of a mixture of probability distributions, find maximal connected subgraphs (i.e. substructures) of the Bayesian factorization graph (i.e., the structure of a probabilistic model), independently fit each substructure by a mixture distribution estimated from clustering results in the corresponding partial-string space (i.e., subspace, subproblem), and draw the offspring by an independent subspace-based sampling. Experimental results show that the rBOA finds, with a sublinear scale-up behavior for decomposable problems, a solution that is superior in quality to that found by a mixed iterative density-estimation evolutionary algorithm (mIDEA) as the problem size grows. Moreover, the rBOA generally outperforms the mIDEA on well-known benchmarks for real-valued optimization.",2004
