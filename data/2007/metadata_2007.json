        "description": "Estimation of\u00a0Distribution\u00a0Algorithm (EDA)\u00a0model\u00a0is an optimization procedure through learning and sampling a conditional probabilistic function. The use of conditional density function permits multivariate dependency modelling, which is not captured in a population-based representation, like the classical Genetic Algorithms. The Gaussian\u00a0model\u00a0is a simple and widely used\u00a0model\u00a0for density estimation. However, an assumption of normality is not realistic for many real-life problems. Alternatively, the\u00a0maximum-entropy\u00a0model\u00a0can be used, which makes no assumption of a normal\u00a0distribution. One disadvantage of the\u00a0maximum-entropy\u00a0model\u00a0is the learning cost of its parameters. This paper proposes an A daptiue\u00a0Estimated\u00a0Maximurn-Entropy\u00a0Distribution\u00a0(Adaptive\u00a0MEED)\u00a0model, which aims to reduce learning complexity of building a\u00a0model.\u00a0Adaptive\u00a0MEED exploits the fact that samples have a low average fitness in the early stage, but they gradually converge to an optima towards the end of the search. Hence, it is not necessary to inference the\u00a0model\u00a0with a fall account of observed constraints in the early stage of the search. The proposed\u00a0model\u00a0attempts to estimate the density function with a dynamic set of samples and active constraints. In addition, the proposed\u00a0model\u00a0includes a global sampling function to address the issue of a missing mutation operator. The ergodic convergence properties ot\"the proposed\u00a0model\u00a0are discussed with the Markov Chain analysis. The preliminary experimental evaluation shows that the proposed\u00a0model\u00a0performs well against genetic algorithms on several clustering problems. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

This monitoring can be more effective if in addition to standard clinical parameters genetic information is used because of its ability to predict hereditary diseases like cardiac problems. Current clinical practices, however, only stress on physiological observation to predict heart failure rate which could miss the important information which could lead to fatal consequences. This paper presents Ambient Cardiac Expert (ACE) which combines physiological parameters observed using sensor networks with gene expression data to predict the heart failure rate. The system uses well established Support Vector Machines (SVM) for class prediction and uses Wrapper Evolutionary Algorithm based on Gaussian Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) to determine cardiac patient's criticality. Results suggest that ACE can be successfully applied for cardiac patient monitoring and has ability to integrate the information from both clinical and genetic sources.",

The conditional probability\u00a0of\u00a0each variable in the network is computed according to\u00a0an\u00a0initial set\u00a0of\u00a0promising solutions.

The global optimization algorithm is based on estimation of distribution algorithms, a set of novel algorithms which are special kinds of evolutionary algorithms. In order to evaluate the behaviour of the algorithm, an analysis of different parameters is performed by means of analysis of variance (ANOVA). The evaluation was carried out using artificial datasets, and with UCI datasets.

In this paper we argue that the same holds for multi-objective optimization. Our aim in this paper is to transfer a solution called Adaptive Variance Scaling (AVS) from the single-objective case to the multi-objective case. To this end, we zoom in on an existing EDA for continuous multi-objective optimization the MIDEA, which employs mixture distributions. We. propose a means to combine AVS with the normal mixture distribution, as opposed to the single normal distribution for which AVS was introduced. Tit addition, we improve the AVS scheme, using the Standard-Deviation Ratio (SDR.) trigger. Intuitively put, variance scaling is triggered by the SDR, trigger only if improvements are found to be far away front the mean. For the multi-objective case, this addition is important to keep the variance from bent, scaled to excessively, large values. From experiments performed oil five well-known benchmark problems. the addition of SDR and AVS is found to enlarge the class of problems that continuous multi-objective EDAs can solve reliably.",

Our new approach, called Evolutionary Bayesian Classifier- based Optimization Algorithm (EBCOA), employs Bayesian classifiers instead of Bayesian or Gaussian networks in order to evolve individuals to a fitter population. In brief, EBCOAs are characterized by applying Bayesian classification techniques -usually applied to supervised classification problems-to optimization in continuous domains. We propose and review in this paper different Bayesian classifiers for implementing our EBCOA method, focusing particularly on EBCOAs applying nai ve Bayes, semi-naive Bayes, and tree augmented naive Bayes classifiers. This work presents a deep study on the behavior of these algorithms with classical optimiztion problems in continuous domains. The different parameters used for tuning the performance of the algorithms are discussed, and a comprehensive overview of their influence is provided.

The full data association problem in visual tracking is formulated as a hypotheses search with a heuristic evaluation function to take into account structural and specific information such as distance, shape, colour, etc. This heuristic should represent the real problem so that its optimization leads to the solution of each situation. In order to guarantee performance in real time, the search process will have assigned a bounded amount of time to give the solution. The number of evaluations is restricted to accomplish this bound. The use of Estimation Distribution Algorithms (EDA) allows the application of an Evolutionary Computation technique to search in the hypothesis space. The performance of alternative algorithms used to provide the solution with this time constraint will be compared considering complex situations.",

The average time complexity is a crucial criterion that measures the performance of the stochastic algorithms. In the past few years, various kinds of EDAs have been proposed, but the related theoretical study on the time complexity of these algorithms is relatively few. This paper analyzed the time complexity of two early versions of EDA, the Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm (UMDA) and the Incremental UMDA (IUMDA). We generalize the concept of convergence to convergence time, and manage to estimate the upper bound of the mean First Hitting Times (FHTs) of UMDA (IUMDA) on a well-known pseudo-modular function, which is frequently studied in the field of genetic algorithms. Our analysis shows that UMDA (IUMDA) has O(n) behaviors on the pseudo-modular function. In addition, we analyze the mean FHT of IUMDA on a hard problem. Our result shows that IUMDA may spend exponential generations to find the global optimum. This is the first time that the mean first hitting times of UMDA (IUMDA) are theoretically studied.",

The second question should be answered by exploiting the insights that have been gained from formal models, We contribute, to the theoretical literature oil continuous EDAs by focussing on a simple, yet important, question: HOW Should the variances used to sample offspring front change over all EDA run? To answer this question, the convergence process is separated into three phases and it is shown that for each phase, a preferable strategy exists for setting the variances. It is highly likely that the use of variances that have been estimated with maximum likelihood is not optimal. Thus, variance modification policies are not just a nice add-on.

        "description": "Recently, advances have been made in continuous, normal-distribution-based Estimation-of-Distribution (EDAs) by scaling the variance up from the maximum-likelihood estimate. When done properly, such scaling has been shown to prevent premature convergence on slope-like regions of the search space. In this paper we specifically focus on one way of scaling that was previously introduced as Adaptive Variance Scaling (ANTS.). It was found that when using ANTS, the average number of fitness evaluations grows subquadratically with the dimensionality on a wide range of unimodal test-problems, competitively with the CMA-ES. Still, room for improvement exists because the. variance doesn't always have to be scaled. A previously introduced trigger based oil correlation that determines when to apply scaling was shown to fail on higher dimensional problems. Here we provide a new solution called the Standard-Deviation Ratio (SDR.) trigger that is integrated with the Iterated Density-Estimation Evolutionary Algorithm (IDEA). Intuitively put, scaling is triggered with SDR only if improvements are found to be far away from the mean. SDR, works even in high dimensions as a result of factorizing the decision rule behind the trigger according to the estimated Bayesian factorization. We evaluate SDR-AVS-IDEA on the same set of benchmark problems and compare it with ANTS-IDEA and CMA-ES. We find that the addition of SDR gives AVS-IDEA an important extra edge for it to be used in future research and in applications both in single-objective optimization as well as in multi-objective and dynamic optimization In addition, we provide practical rules of thumb for parameter settings for using SDR-AVS-IDEA that, result in an asymptotic scale-up behavior that is sublinear for the population size (O(l(0.85))) and subquadratic (O(l(1.85))) for the number of evaluations.",

Firstly, in order to extract useful features and reduce dimensionality, different feature selection methods based on correlation analysis are used to form different feature subsets.

This means that as population sizes increase the dependency between variable values for any strict subset of a parity function's bits decreases. Unfortunately most EDAs including hBOA search for their models by looking for dependencies between pairs of variables (at least at first).|We make suggestions on how EDAs could be adjusted to handle parity problems, but also comment on the apparently inevitable computational cost.",

It is a universal problem that all existing Gaussian based EDAs using full covariance matrix suffer from. Through theoretical analysis with examples of simulated data and experiments, we show that the ill-posed covariance matrix strongly affects those EDAs.

This difference can be an important advantage because of two main reasons. First, in some real problems cyclic relationships appear between variables an this fact cannot be represented in a Bayesian network. Secondly, dependency networks can be built easily due to the fact that there is no need to check the existence of cycles as in a Bayesian network.|In this paper we propose to use a general (multivariate) model in order to deal with a richer representation, however, in this initial approach to the problem we also propose to constraint the construction phase in order to use only bivariate statistics.

There are three crucial parameters in hBOA: (1) the selection pressure, (2) the window size for restricted tournaments, and (3) the population size. Although both the selection pressure and the window size influence hBOA performance, the asymptotic time complexity of hBOA should not change with typical choices of these two parameters. However, there is no population size that is suitable for all problems of interest because the population size strongly depends on problem size and problem difficulty. To eliminate the population size, the parameter-less hBOA adopts the population-sizing technique of the parameter-less genetic algorithm. Based on the existing theory, the parameter-less hBOA should be able to solve nearly decomposable and hierarchical problems in a quadratic or subquadratic number of function evaluations without the need for setting any parameters whatsoever. A number of experiments are presented to verify scalability of the parameter-less hBOA.

The parameter updating procedure in MRAS is guided by a sequence of implicit probabilistic models we call reference models.

This assumption may not be realistic for complex biological systems such as disease susceptibility where nonlinearities in the genotype to phenotype mapping relationship that result from epistasis, plastic reaction norms, locus heterogeneity, and phenocopy, for example, are the norm rather than the exception. We have previously developed a flexible modeling approach called symbolic discriminant analysis (SDA) that makes no assumptions about the patterns in the data. Rather, SDA lets the data dictate the size, shape, and complexity of a symbolic discriminant function that could include any set of mathematical functions from a list of candidates supplied by the user. Here, we outline a new five step process for symbolic model discovery that uses genetic programming (GP) for coarse-grained stochastic searching, experimental design for parameter optimization, graphical modeling for generating expert knowledge, and estimation of distribution algorithms for fine-grained stochastic searching. Finally, we introduce function mapping as a new method for interpreting symbolic discriminant functions. We show that function mapping when combined with measures of interaction information facilitates statistical interpretation by providing a graphical approach to decomposing complex models to highlight synergistic, redundant, and independent effects of polymorphisms and their composite functions. We illustrate this five step SDA modeling process with a real case-control dataset. Copyright (c) 2007 S. Karger AG, Basel.",

        "description": "We present a supervised wrapper approach to discretization. In contrast to many classical approaches, the discretization process is multivariate: all variables are discretized simultaneously, and the proposed discretization is evaluated with the Naive-Bayes classifier. The search for the optimal discretization is carried out as an optimization process with the learning model estimated accuracy guiding it. The global optimization algorithm is based on estimation of distribution algorithms, a set of novel algorithms which are special kinds of evolutionary algorithms. In order to evaluate the behaviour of the algorithm, an analysis of different parameters is performed by means of analysis of variance (ANOVA). The evaluation was carried out using artificial datasets, and with UCI datasets. The results suggest that the proposed method provides an effective and robust technique for discretizating variables.",

In this paper we argue that the same holds for multi-objective optimization. Our aim in this paper is to transfer a solution called Adaptive Variance Scaling (AVS) from the single-objective case to the multi-objective case. To this end, we zoom in on an existing EDA for continuous multi-objective optimization the MIDEA, which employs mixture distributions. We. propose a means to combine AVS with the normal mixture distribution, as opposed to the single normal distribution for which AVS was introduced. Tit addition, we improve the AVS scheme, using the Standard-Deviation Ratio (SDR.) trigger. Intuitively put, variance scaling is triggered by the SDR, trigger only if improvements are found to be far away front the mean. For the multi-objective case, this addition is important to keep the variance from bent, scaled to excessively, large values. From experiments performed oil five well-known benchmark problems. the addition of SDR and AVS is found to enlarge the class of problems that continuous multi-objective EDAs can solve reliably.",

This approach is based on Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) in which Bayesian or Gaussian networks are applied to the evolution of a population of individuals (i.e. potential solutions to the optimization problem) in order to improve the quality of the individuals of the next generation. Our new approach, called Evolutionary Bayesian Classifier- based Optimization Algorithm (EBCOA), employs Bayesian classifiers instead of Bayesian or Gaussian networks in order to evolve individuals to a fitter population. In brief, EBCOAs are characterized by applying Bayesian classification techniques -usually applied to supervised classification problems-to optimization in continuous domains. We propose and review in this paper different Bayesian classifiers for implementing our EBCOA method, focusing particularly on EBCOAs applying nai ve Bayes, semi-naive Bayes, and tree augmented naive Bayes classifiers. This work presents a deep study on the behavior of these algorithms with classical optimiztion problems in continuous domains. The different parameters used for tuning the performance of the algorithms are discussed, and a comprehensive overview of their influence is provided.

To answer this question, the convergence process is separated into three phases and it is shown that for each phase, a preferable strategy exists for setting the variances. It is highly likely that the use of variances that have been estimated with maximum likelihood is not optimal. Thus, variance modification policies are not just a nice add-on.

        "description": "Recently, advances have been made in continuous, normal-distribution-based Estimation-of-Distribution (EDAs) by scaling the variance up from the maximum-likelihood estimate. When done properly, such scaling has been shown to prevent premature convergence on slope-like regions of the search space. In this paper we specifically focus on one way of scaling that was previously introduced as Adaptive Variance Scaling (ANTS.). It was found that when using ANTS, the average number of fitness evaluations grows subquadratically with the dimensionality on a wide range of unimodal test-problems, competitively with the CMA-ES. Still, room for improvement exists because the. variance doesn't always have to be scaled. A previously introduced trigger based oil correlation that determines when to apply scaling was shown to fail on higher dimensional problems. Here we provide a new solution called the Standard-Deviation Ratio (SDR.) trigger that is integrated with the Iterated Density-Estimation Evolutionary Algorithm (IDEA). Intuitively put, scaling is triggered with SDR only if improvements are found to be far away from the mean. SDR, works even in high dimensions as a result of factorizing the decision rule behind the trigger according to the estimated Bayesian factorization. We evaluate SDR-AVS-IDEA on the same set of benchmark problems and compare it with ANTS-IDEA and CMA-ES. We find that the addition of SDR gives AVS-IDEA an important extra edge for it to be used in future research and in applications both in single-objective optimization as well as in multi-objective and dynamic optimization In addition, we provide practical rules of thumb for parameter settings for using SDR-AVS-IDEA that, result in an asymptotic scale-up behavior that is sublinear for the population size (O(l(0.85))) and subquadratic (O(l(1.85))) for the number of evaluations.",

While EDAs have shown great promise on difficult problems with strong epistasis between genes, such as hierarchical and deceptive problems, they have not been a choice for non-stationary problems where the target solution changes over time. This work aims to explore the diversity within the population of an EDA using a supervised classifier. We introduce a technique, Sampling-Mutation, that can help increase the useful diversity within the population.

The use of cardinality constraints transforms portfolio selection into an NP-hard mixed-integer quadratic optimization problem that is difficult to solve by standard methods. An implementation of the algorithm that employs a genetic algorithm with a set representation, an appropriately defined mutation operator and Random Assortment Recombination for crossover (RAR-GA) is compared with implementations using various estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). Without the pruning heuristic, RAR-GA is superior to the implementations with EDAs in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.

Although these functions are separable, with bounded complexity and uniformly scaled sub-function contributions, the hierarchical Bayesian Optimization Algorithm (hBOA) scales exponentially on both. hBOA is able to solve large CPFs with small population sizes when it is unable to solve them with larger population sizes.|We argue that test problems containing parity functions are hard for EDAs because there are no interactions in the contribution to fitness between any strict subset of a parity function's bits. This means that as population sizes increase the dependency between variable values for any strict subset of a parity function's bits decreases. Unfortunately most EDAs including hBOA search for their models by looking for dependencies between pairs of variables (at least at first).|We make suggestions on how EDAs could be adjusted to handle parity problems, but also comment on the apparently inevitable computational cost.",

It is a universal problem that all existing Gaussian based EDAs using full covariance matrix suffer from. Through theoretical analysis with examples of simulated data and experiments, we show that the ill-posed covariance matrix strongly affects those EDAs. This paper proposes a Covariance Matrix Repairing (CMR) method to fix ill-posed covariance matrix. CMR significantly improves the robustness of EDAs. Even some EDA's performance that was previously thought inefficient can be improved surprisingly with the help of CMR. CMR can also guarantee those EDAs to be used with small scale of population (but still should be large enough to find the global optimum) to accelerate the convergence rate while maintaining the quality of solutions.",

This approach is based on using dependency networks [1] instead of Bayesian networks or simpler models in which structure is limited. Dependency networks are probabilistic graphical models similar to Bayesian networks, but with a significant difference: they allow directed cycles in the graph. This difference can be an important advantage because of two main reasons. First, in some real problems cyclic relationships appear between variables an this fact cannot be represented in a Bayesian network. Secondly, dependency networks can be built easily due to the fact that there is no need to check the existence of cycles as in a Bayesian network.|In this paper we propose to use a general (multivariate) model in order to deal with a richer representation, however, in this initial approach to the problem we also propose to constraint the construction phase in order to use only bivariate statistics.

There are three crucial parameters in hBOA: (1) the selection pressure, (2) the window size for restricted tournaments, and (3) the population size. Although both the selection pressure and the window size influence hBOA performance, the asymptotic time complexity of hBOA should not change with typical choices of these two parameters. However, there is no population size that is suitable for all problems of interest because the population size strongly depends on problem size and problem difficulty. To eliminate the population size, the parameter-less hBOA adopts the population-sizing technique of the parameter-less genetic algorithm. Based on the existing theory, the parameter-less hBOA should be able to solve nearly decomposable and hierarchical problems in a quadratic or subquadratic number of function evaluations without the need for setting any parameters whatsoever. A number of experiments are presented to verify scalability of the parameter-less hBOA. The chapter also discusses how the parameter-less population-sizing scheme can be incorporated into other estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs).",

These candidate solutions are then used to update the parameters associated with the probabilistic model in such a way that the future search will be biased toward the region containing high-quality solutions. The parameter updating procedure in MRAS is guided by a sequence of implicit probabilistic models we call reference models. We provide a particular algorithm instantiation of the MRAS method, where the sequence of reference models can be viewed as the generalized probability distribution models for estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) with proportional selection scheme. In addition, we show that the model reference framework can also be used to describe the recently proposed cross-entropy (CE) method for optimization and to study its properties. Hence, this paper can also be seen as a study on the effectiveness of combining CE and EDAs.

        "description": "The workhorse of modern genetic analysis is the parametric linear model. The advantages of the linear modeling framework are many and include a mathematical understanding of the model fitting process and ease of interpretation. However, an important limitation is that linear models make assumptions about the nature of the data being modeled. This assumption may not be realistic for complex biological systems such as disease susceptibility where nonlinearities in the genotype to phenotype mapping relationship that result from epistasis, plastic reaction norms, locus heterogeneity, and phenocopy, for example, are the norm rather than the exception. We have previously developed a flexible modeling approach called symbolic discriminant analysis (SDA) that makes no assumptions about the patterns in the data. Rather, SDA lets the data dictate the size, shape, and complexity of a symbolic discriminant function that could include any set of mathematical functions from a list of candidates supplied by the user. Here, we outline a new five step process for symbolic model discovery that uses genetic programming (GP) for coarse-grained stochastic searching, experimental design for parameter optimization, graphical modeling for generating expert knowledge, and estimation of distribution algorithms for fine-grained stochastic searching. Finally, we introduce function mapping as a new method for interpreting symbolic discriminant functions. We show that function mapping when combined with measures of interaction information facilitates statistical interpretation by providing a graphical approach to decomposing complex models to highlight synergistic, redundant, and independent effects of polymorphisms and their composite functions. We illustrate this five step SDA modeling process with a real case-control dataset. Copyright (c) 2007 S. Karger AG, Basel.",

Our aim in this paper is to transfer a solution called Adaptive Variance Scaling (AVS) from the single-objective case to the multi-objective case. To this end, we zoom in on an existing EDA for continuous multi-objective optimization the MIDEA, which employs mixture distributions. We. propose a means to combine AVS with the normal mixture distribution, as opposed to the single normal distribution for which AVS was introduced. Tit addition, we improve the AVS scheme, using the Standard-Deviation Ratio (SDR.) trigger. Intuitively put, variance scaling is triggered by the SDR, trigger only if improvements are found to be far away front the mean. For the multi-objective case, this addition is important to keep the variance from bent, scaled to excessively, large values.

While most of the work on test data generation has concentrated on procedural software, little attention has been paid to object oriented programs, even so they are a usual practice nowadays.|We present an approach based on Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) for dealing with the test data generation of a particular type of objects, that is, containers. This is the first time that an EDA has been applied to testing object oriented software. In addition to automated test data generation, the EDA approach also offers the potential of modelling the fitness landscape defined by the testing problem and thus could provide some insight into the problem. Firstly, we show results from empirical evaluations and comment on some appealing properties of EDAs in this context. Next, a framework is discussed in order to deal with the generation of efficient tests for the container classes. Preliminary results are provided as well.",

This approach is based on Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) in which Bayesian or Gaussian networks are applied to the evolution of a population of individuals (i.e. potential solutions to the optimization problem) in order to improve the quality of the individuals of the next generation. Our new approach, called Evolutionary Bayesian Classifier- based Optimization Algorithm (EBCOA), employs Bayesian classifiers instead of Bayesian or Gaussian networks in order to evolve individuals to a fitter population. In brief, EBCOAs are characterized by applying Bayesian classification techniques -usually applied to supervised classification problems-to optimization in continuous domains. We propose and review in this paper different Bayesian classifiers for implementing our EBCOA method, focusing particularly on EBCOAs applying nai ve Bayes, semi-naive Bayes, and tree augmented naive Bayes classifiers. This work presents a deep study on the behavior of these algorithms with classical optimiztion problems in continuous domains. The different parameters used for tuning the performance of the algorithms are discussed, and a comprehensive overview of their influence is provided. We also present experimental results to compare this new method with other state of the art approaches of the evolutionary computation field for continuous domains such as Evolutionary Strategies (ES) and Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs).",

This paper analyzed the time complexity of two early versions of EDA, the Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm (UMDA) and the Incremental UMDA (IUMDA). We generalize the concept of convergence to convergence time, and manage to estimate the upper bound of the mean First Hitting Times (FHTs) of UMDA (IUMDA) on a well-known pseudo-modular function, which is frequently studied in the field of genetic algorithms. Our analysis shows that UMDA (IUMDA) has O(n) behaviors on the pseudo-modular function. In addition, we analyze the mean FHT of IUMDA on a hard problem.

The second question should be answered by exploiting the insights that have been gained from formal models, We contribute, to the theoretical literature oil continuous EDAs by focussing on a simple, yet important, question: HOW Should the variances used to sample offspring front change over all EDA run? To answer this question, the convergence process is separated into three phases and it is shown that for each phase, a preferable strategy exists for setting the variances. It is highly likely that the use of variances that have been estimated with maximum likelihood is not optimal. Thus, variance modification policies are not just a nice add-on. In the light of our findings, they become an integral component of continuous EDAs, and they should consider the specific requirements of all phases of the optimization process.",

        "description": "Recently, advances have been made in continuous, normal-distribution-based Estimation-of-Distribution (EDAs) by scaling the variance up from the maximum-likelihood estimate. When done properly, such scaling has been shown to prevent premature convergence on slope-like regions of the search space. In this paper we specifically focus on one way of scaling that was previously introduced as Adaptive Variance Scaling (ANTS.). It was found that when using ANTS, the average number of fitness evaluations grows subquadratically with the dimensionality on a wide range of unimodal test-problems, competitively with the CMA-ES. Still, room for improvement exists because the. variance doesn't always have to be scaled. A previously introduced trigger based oil correlation that determines when to apply scaling was shown to fail on higher dimensional problems. Here we provide a new solution called the Standard-Deviation Ratio (SDR.) trigger that is integrated with the Iterated Density-Estimation Evolutionary Algorithm (IDEA). Intuitively put, scaling is triggered with SDR only if improvements are found to be far away from the mean. SDR, works even in high dimensions as a result of factorizing the decision rule behind the trigger according to the estimated Bayesian factorization. We evaluate SDR-AVS-IDEA on the same set of benchmark problems and compare it with ANTS-IDEA and CMA-ES. We find that the addition of SDR gives AVS-IDEA an important extra edge for it to be used in future research and in applications both in single-objective optimization as well as in multi-objective and dynamic optimization In addition, we provide practical rules of thumb for parameter settings for using SDR-AVS-IDEA that, result in an asymptotic scale-up behavior that is sublinear for the population size (O(l(0.85))) and subquadratic (O(l(1.85))) for the number of evaluations.",

In this paper, we analyze continuous EDAs and show that they don't always work because of computation error: covariance matrix of Gaussian model can be ill-posed and Gaussian based EDAs using full covariance matrix will fail under specific conditions. It is a universal problem that all existing Gaussian based EDAs using full covariance matrix suffer from. Through theoretical analysis with examples of simulated data and experiments, we show that the ill-posed covariance matrix strongly affects those EDAs. This paper proposes a Covariance Matrix Repairing (CMR) method to fix ill-posed covariance matrix. CMR significantly improves the robustness of EDAs. Even some EDA's performance that was previously thought inefficient can be improved surprisingly with the help of CMR. CMR can also guarantee those EDAs to be used with small scale of population (but still should be large enough to find the global optimum) to accelerate the convergence rate while maintaining the quality of solutions.",

        "description": "Evolutionary programming(EP) focus on the search step size which decides the ability of escaping local minima, however does not touch the issue of search in promising region. Estimation of Distribution Algorithms(EDAs) focus on where the promising region is, however have less consideration about behavior of each individual in solution search algorithms. Since the basic ideas of EP and EDAs are quite different, it is possible to make them reinforce each other. In this paper, we present a hybrid evolutionary framework to make use of both the ideas of EP and EDAs through introducing a mini estimation operator into EP's search cycle. Unlike previous EDAs that use probability density function(PDF), the estimation mechanism used in the proposed framework is the k-nearest neighbor estimation which can perform better with relative small amount of training samples. Our experimental results have shown that the incorporation of machine learning techniques, such as k-nearest neighbor estimation, can improve the performance of evolutionary optimisation algorithms for a large number of benchmark functions.",

        "description": "In this work we present a new proposal in order to model the probability distribution in the estimation of distribution algorithms. This approach is based on using dependency networks [1] instead of Bayesian networks or simpler models in which structure is limited. Dependency networks are probabilistic graphical models similar to Bayesian networks, but with a significant difference: they allow directed cycles in the graph. This difference can be an important advantage because of two main reasons. First, in some real problems cyclic relationships appear between variables an this fact cannot be represented in a Bayesian network. Secondly, dependency networks can be built easily due to the fact that there is no need to check the existence of cycles as in a Bayesian network.|In this paper we propose to use a general (multivariate) model in order to deal with a richer representation, however, in this initial approach to the problem we also propose to constraint the construction phase in order to use only bivariate statistics. The algorithm is compared with classical approaches with the same complexity order, i.e. bivariate models as chains and trees.",

        "description": "This chapter describes the parameter-less hierarchical Bayesian optimization algorithm (hBOA), which enables the use of hBOA without the need for tuning parameters for solving each problem instance. There are three crucial parameters in hBOA: (1) the selection pressure, (2) the window size for restricted tournaments, and (3) the population size. Although both the selection pressure and the window size influence hBOA performance, the asymptotic time complexity of hBOA should not change with typical choices of these two parameters. However, there is no population size that is suitable for all problems of interest because the population size strongly depends on problem size and problem difficulty. To eliminate the population size, the parameter-less hBOA adopts the population-sizing technique of the parameter-less genetic algorithm. Based on the existing theory, the parameter-less hBOA should be able to solve nearly decomposable and hierarchical problems in a quadratic or subquadratic number of function evaluations without the need for setting any parameters whatsoever. A number of experiments are presented to verify scalability of the parameter-less hBOA. The chapter also discusses how the parameter-less population-sizing scheme can be incorporated into other estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs).",

These candidate solutions are then used to update the parameters associated with the probabilistic model in such a way that the future search will be biased toward the region containing high-quality solutions. The parameter updating procedure in MRAS is guided by a sequence of implicit probabilistic models we call reference models. We provide a particular algorithm instantiation of the MRAS method, where the sequence of reference models can be viewed as the generalized probability distribution models for estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) with proportional selection scheme. In addition, we show that the model reference framework can also be used to describe the recently proposed cross-entropy (CE) method for optimization and to study its properties. Hence, this paper can also be seen as a study on the effectiveness of combining CE and EDAs. We prove global convergence of the proposed algorithm in both continuous and combinatorial domains, and we carry out numerical studies to illustrate the performance of the algorithm.",

        "description": "The workhorse of modern genetic analysis is the parametric linear model. The advantages of the linear modeling framework are many and include a mathematical understanding of the model fitting process and ease of interpretation. However, an important limitation is that linear models make assumptions about the nature of the data being modeled. This assumption may not be realistic for complex biological systems such as disease susceptibility where nonlinearities in the genotype to phenotype mapping relationship that result from epistasis, plastic reaction norms, locus heterogeneity, and phenocopy, for example, are the norm rather than the exception. We have previously developed a flexible modeling approach called symbolic discriminant analysis (SDA) that makes no assumptions about the patterns in the data. Rather, SDA lets the data dictate the size, shape, and complexity of a symbolic discriminant function that could include any set of mathematical functions from a list of candidates supplied by the user. Here, we outline a new five step process for symbolic model discovery that uses genetic programming (GP) for coarse-grained stochastic searching, experimental design for parameter optimization, graphical modeling for generating expert knowledge, and estimation of distribution algorithms for fine-grained stochastic searching. Finally, we introduce function mapping as a new method for interpreting symbolic discriminant functions. We show that function mapping when combined with measures of interaction information facilitates statistical interpretation by providing a graphical approach to decomposing complex models to highlight synergistic, redundant, and independent effects of polymorphisms and their composite functions. We illustrate this five step SDA modeling process with a real case-control dataset. Copyright (c) 2007 S. Karger AG, Basel.",

The global optimization algorithm is based on estimation of distribution algorithms, a set of novel algorithms which are special kinds of evolutionary algorithms. In order to evaluate the behaviour of the algorithm, an analysis of different parameters is performed by means of analysis of variance (ANOVA).

In this paper we argue that the same holds for multi-objective optimization. Our aim in this paper is to transfer a solution called Adaptive Variance Scaling (AVS) from the single-objective case to the multi-objective case. To this end, we zoom in on an existing EDA for continuous multi-objective optimization the MIDEA, which employs mixture distributions. We. propose a means to combine AVS with the normal mixture distribution, as opposed to the single normal distribution for which AVS was introduced. Tit addition, we improve the AVS scheme, using the Standard-Deviation Ratio (SDR.) trigger. Intuitively put, variance scaling is triggered by the SDR, trigger only if improvements are found to be far away front the mean. For the multi-objective case, this addition is important to keep the variance from bent, scaled to excessively, large values. From experiments performed oil five well-known benchmark problems. the addition of SDR and AVS is found to enlarge the class of problems that continuous multi-objective EDAs can solve reliably.",

To answer this question, the convergence process is separated into three phases and it is shown that for each phase, a preferable strategy exists for setting the variances. It is highly likely that the use of variances that have been estimated with maximum likelihood is not optimal. Thus, variance modification policies are not just a nice add-on. In the light of our findings, they become an integral component of continuous EDAs, and they should consider the specific requirements of all phases of the optimization process.",

        "title": "SDR: A Better Trigger for Adaptive Variance Scaling in Normal EDAs",
        "authors": "Bosman, PAN, Grahl, J and Rothlauf, F",
        "description": "Recently, advances have been made in continuous, normal-distribution-based Estimation-of-Distribution (EDAs) by scaling the variance up from the maximum-likelihood estimate. When done properly, such scaling has been shown to prevent premature convergence on slope-like regions of the search space. In this paper we specifically focus on one way of scaling that was previously introduced as Adaptive Variance Scaling (ANTS.). It was found that when using ANTS, the average number of fitness evaluations grows subquadratically with the dimensionality on a wide range of unimodal test-problems, competitively with the CMA-ES. Still, room for improvement exists because the. variance doesn't always have to be scaled. A previously introduced trigger based oil correlation that determines when to apply scaling was shown to fail on higher dimensional problems. Here we provide a new solution called the Standard-Deviation Ratio (SDR.) trigger that is integrated with the Iterated Density-Estimation Evolutionary Algorithm (IDEA). Intuitively put, scaling is triggered with SDR only if improvements are found to be far away from the mean. SDR, works even in high dimensions as a result of factorizing the decision rule behind the trigger according to the estimated Bayesian factorization. We evaluate SDR-AVS-IDEA on the same set of benchmark problems and compare it with ANTS-IDEA and CMA-ES. We find that the addition of SDR gives AVS-IDEA an important extra edge for it to be used in future research and in applications both in single-objective optimization as well as in multi-objective and dynamic optimization In addition, we provide practical rules of thumb for parameter settings for using SDR-AVS-IDEA that, result in an asymptotic scale-up behavior that is sublinear for the population size (O(l(0.85))) and subquadratic (O(l(1.85))) for the number of evaluations.",

Firstly, in order to extract useful features and reduce dimensionality, different feature selection methods based on correlation analysis are used to form different feature subsets. Then a pool of candidate base classifiers is generated to learn the subsets which are re-sampling from the different feature subsets. At last, appropriate classifiers are selected to construct the classification committee using EDA (Estimation of Distribution Algorithms) algorithm.

It always adapts the search toward the last promising solution found thus leading to a smoother and more efficient exploration. In this paper, vQEA is tested and compared to a Classical Genetic Algorithm CGA and to a QEA on several benchmark problems. Experiments have shown that vQEA performs better than both CGA and QEA in terms of speed and accuracy. It is a highly scalable algorithm as well.

The use of cardinality constraints transforms portfolio selection into an NP-hard mixed-integer quadratic optimization problem that is difficult to solve by standard methods. An implementation of the algorithm that employs a genetic algorithm with a set representation, an appropriately defined mutation operator and Random Assortment Recombination for crossover (RAR-GA) is compared with implementations using various estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). Without the pruning heuristic, RAR-GA is superior to the implementations with EDAs in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. The incorporation of the pruning heuristic leads to a significant decrease in computation times and makes EDAs competitive with RAR-GA.",

We describe two test problems; the concatenated parity function (CPF), and the concatenated parity/trap function (CP/TF). Although these functions are separable, with bounded complexity and uniformly scaled sub-function contributions, the hierarchical Bayesian Optimization Algorithm (hBOA) scales exponentially on both. hBOA is able to solve large CPFs with small population sizes when it is unable to solve them with larger population sizes.|We argue that test problems containing parity functions are hard for EDAs because there are no interactions in the contribution to fitness between any strict subset of a parity function's bits. This means that as population sizes increase the dependency between variable values for any strict subset of a parity function's bits decreases. Unfortunately most EDAs including hBOA search for their models by looking for dependencies between pairs of variables (at least at first).|We make suggestions on how EDAs could be adjusted to handle parity problems, but also comment on the apparently inevitable computational cost.",

It is a universal problem that all existing Gaussian based EDAs using full covariance matrix suffer from. Through theoretical analysis with examples of simulated data and experiments, we show that the ill-posed covariance matrix strongly affects those EDAs. This paper proposes a Covariance Matrix Repairing (CMR) method to fix ill-posed covariance matrix. CMR significantly improves the robustness of EDAs. Even some EDA's performance that was previously thought inefficient can be improved surprisingly with the help of CMR.

Dependency networks are probabilistic graphical models similar to Bayesian networks, but with a significant difference: they allow directed cycles in the graph. This difference can be an important advantage because of two main reasons. First, in some real problems cyclic relationships appear between variables an this fact cannot be represented in a Bayesian network. Secondly, dependency networks can be built easily due to the fact that there is no need to check the existence of cycles as in a Bayesian network.|In this paper we propose to use a general (multivariate) model in order to deal with a richer representation, however, in this initial approach to the problem we also propose to constraint the construction phase in order to use only bivariate statistics.

There are three crucial parameters in hBOA: (1) the selection pressure, (2) the window size for restricted tournaments, and (3) the population size. Although both the selection pressure and the window size influence hBOA performance, the asymptotic time complexity of hBOA should not change with typical choices of these two parameters. However, there is no population size that is suitable for all problems of interest because the population size strongly depends on problem size and problem difficulty. To eliminate the population size, the parameter-less hBOA adopts the population-sizing technique of the parameter-less genetic algorithm. Based on the existing theory, the parameter-less hBOA should be able to solve nearly decomposable and hierarchical problems in a quadratic or subquadratic number of function evaluations without the need for setting any parameters whatsoever. A number of experiments are presented to verify scalability of the parameter-less hBOA. The chapter also discusses how the parameter-less population-sizing scheme can be incorporated into other estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs).",

        "description": "The workhorse of modern genetic analysis is the parametric linear model. The advantages of the linear modeling framework are many and include a mathematical understanding of the model fitting process and ease of interpretation. However, an important limitation is that linear models make assumptions about the nature of the data being modeled. This assumption may not be realistic for complex biological systems such as disease susceptibility where nonlinearities in the genotype to phenotype mapping relationship that result from epistasis, plastic reaction norms, locus heterogeneity, and phenocopy, for example, are the norm rather than the exception. We have previously developed a flexible modeling approach called symbolic discriminant analysis (SDA) that makes no assumptions about the patterns in the data. Rather, SDA lets the data dictate the size, shape, and complexity of a symbolic discriminant function that could include any set of mathematical functions from a list of candidates supplied by the user. Here, we outline a new five step process for symbolic model discovery that uses genetic programming (GP) for coarse-grained stochastic searching, experimental design for parameter optimization, graphical modeling for generating expert knowledge, and estimation of distribution algorithms for fine-grained stochastic searching. Finally, we introduce function mapping as a new method for interpreting symbolic discriminant functions. We show that function mapping when combined with measures of interaction information facilitates statistical interpretation by providing a graphical approach to decomposing complex models to highlight synergistic, redundant, and independent effects of polymorphisms and their composite functions. We illustrate this five step SDA modeling process with a real case-control dataset. Copyright (c) 2007 S. Karger AG, Basel.",
