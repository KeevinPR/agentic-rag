        "description": "The probabilistic model building performed by estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) enables these methods to use advanced techniques of statistics and machine learning for automatic discovery of problem structures. However, in some situations, it may not be possible to completely and accurately identify the whole problem structure by probabilistic modeling due to certain inherent properties of the given problem. In this work, we illustrate one possible cause of such situations with problems consisting of structures with unequal fitness contributions. Based on the illustrative example, we introduce a notion that the estimated probabilistic models should be inspected to reveal the effective search directions and further propose a general approach which utilizes a reserved set of solutions to examine the built model for likely inaccurate fragments. Furthermore, the proposed approach is implemented on the extended compact genetic algorithm (ECGA) and experiments are performed on several sets of additively separable problems with different scaling setups. The results indicate that the proposed method can significantly assist ECGA to handle problems comprising structures of disparate fitness contributions and therefore may potentially help EDAs in general to overcome those situations in which the entire problem structure cannot be recognized properly due to the temporal delay of emergence of some promising partial solutions.",

        "description": "The construction of a Spiking Neural Network (SNN), i.e., the choice of an appropriate topology and the configuration of its internal parameters, represents a great challenge for SNN based applications. Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) offer an elegant solution for these challenges and methods capable of exploring both types of search spaces simultaneously appear to be the most promising ones. A variety of such heterogeneous optimization algorithms have emerged recently, in particular in the field of probabilistic optimization. In this paper, a literature review on heterogeneous optimization algorithms is presented and an example of probabilistic optimization of SNN is discussed in detail. The paper provides an experimental analysis of a novel Heterogeneous Multi-Model Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (hMM-EDA). First, practical guidelines for configuring the method are derived and then the performance of hMM-EDA is compared to state-of-the-art optimization algorithms. Results show hMM-EDA as a light-weight, fast and reliable optimization method that requires the configuration of only very few parameters. Its performance on a synthetic heterogeneous benchmark problem is highly competitive and suggests its suitability for the optimization of SNN.",

        "description": "The complete topology design problem of survivable mesh-based transport networks is to address simultaneously design of network topology, working path routing, and spare capacity allocation based on span-restoration. Each constituent problem in the complete design problem could be formulated as an Integer Programming (IP) and is proved to be NP-hard. Due to a large amount of decision variables and constraints involved in the IP formulation, to solve the problem directly by exact algorithms (e. g. branch-and-bound) would be impractical if not impossible. In this paper, we present a two-level evolutionary approach to address the complete topology design problem. In the low-level, two parameterized greedy heuristics are developed to jointly construct feasible solutions (i.e., closed graph topologies satisfying all the mesh-based network survivable constraints) of the complete problem. Unlike existing \"zoom-in\"-based heuristics in which subsets of the constraints are considered, the proposed heuristics take all constraints into account. An estimation of distribution algorithm works on the top of the heuristics to tune the control parameters. As a result, optimal solution to the considered problem is more likely to be constructed from the heuristics with the optimal control parameters. The proposed algorithm is evaluated experimentally in comparison with the latest heuristics based on the IP software CPLEX, and the \"zoom-in\"-based approach on 28 test networks problems. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is more effective in finding high-quality topologies than the IP-based heuristic algorithm in 21 out of 28 test instances with much less computational costs, and performs significantly better than the \"zoom-in\"-based approach in 19 instances with the same computational costs.",

        "description": "One of the applications of DNA microarrays is recognizing the presence or absence of different biological components (targets) in a sample. Hence, the quality of the microarrays design which includes selecting short Oligonucleotide sequences (probes) to be affixed on the surface of the microarray becomes a major issue. A good design is the one that contains the minimum possible number of probes while having an acceptable ability in identifying the targets existing in the sample. This paper focuses on the problem of computing the minimal set of probes which is able to identify each target of a sample, referred to as non-unique oligonucleotide probe selection. We present the application of an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) named Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA) to this problem, for the first time. The proposed approach considers integration of BOA and one simple heuristic introduced for the non-unique probe selection problem. The results provided by this approach compare favorably with the state-of-the-art methods in the single target case. While most of the recent research works on this problem has been focusing on the single target case only, we present the application of our method in integration with decoding approach in a multiobjective optimization framework for solving the problem in the case of multiple targets.

        "description": "Unconstrained binary quadratic programming problem (UBQP) consists in maximizing a quadratic 0-1 function. It is a well known NP-hard problem and is a unified model for a variety of combinatorial optimization problems. This paper presents a discrete Hopfield neural network (DHNN) combined with estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) for the UBQP. The idea of EDA is combined with the DHNN in order to overcome the local minima problem of the network. Once the network is trapped in local minima, the perturbation based on EDA can generate a new starting point for the DHNN for further search, which is in a promising area characterized by a probability model. Thus, the proposed algorithm, named DHNN-EDA, can escape from local minima and further search better results. The DHNN-EDA is tested on a large number of benchmark problems with size up to 7000 variables. Simulation results on the UBQP show that the DHNN-EDA is better than the other improved DHNN algorithms such as multi-start DHNN and DHNN with random flips, and is better than or competitive with metaheuristic algorithms such as simulated annealing, tabu search, scatter search and memetic algorithm.

This paper proposes a novel hybrid estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) to solve the PSP problem on HP model. First, a composite fitness function containing the information cif folding structure core (I-I-core) is introduced to replace the traditional fitness function of HP model. The proposed fitness function is expected to select better individuals for the probabilistic model of EDA. Second, local search with guided operators is utilized to refine the found solutions for improving the efficiency of EDA. Third, an improved backtracking-based repairing method is proposed to repair invalid individuals sampled by the probabilistic model of EDA. It can significantly reduce the number of backtracking searching operation and the computational cost for a long-sequence protein. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperform the basic EDA method. At the same time, it is very competitive with other existing algorithms for the PSP problem on lattice HP models. (C) 2010 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

        "description": "An adaptive discretization method, called split-on-demand (SoD), enables estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) for discrete variables to solve continuous optimization problems. SoD randomly splits a continuous interval if the number of search points within the interval exceeds a threshold, which is decreased at every iteration. After the split operation, the nonempty intervals are assigned integer codes, and the search points are discretized accordingly. As an example of using SoD with EDAs, the integration of SoD and the extended compact genetic algorithm (ECGA) is presented and numerically examined. In this integration, we adopt a local search mechanism as an optional component of our back end optimization engine. As a result, the proposed framework can be considered as a memetic algorithm, and SoD can potentially be applied to other memetic algorithms. The numerical experiments consist of two parts: (1) a set of benchmark functions on which ECGA with SoD and ECGA with two well-known discretization methods: the fixed-height histogram (FHH) and the fixed-width histogram (FWH) are compared; (2) a real-world application, the economic dispatch problem, on which ECGA with SoD is compared to other methods. The experimental results indicate that SoD is a better discretization method to work with ECGA. Moreover, ECGA with SoD works quite well on the economic dispatch problem and delivers solutions better than the best known results obtained by other methods in existence.",

        "description": "This paper is concerned with the Indian design of a 220 MWe pressurized heavy water reactor (PHWR) having natural uranium (NU) fuel and heavy water as moderator and coolant. At the beginning of life, it is necessary to flatten the power by loading some depleted uranium (DU) bundles to achieve a nearly full power operation. The determination of best possible locations of DU bundles, which maximize fuel economy as well as safety, is a large-sized combinatorial optimization problem with constraints. In the past, 384 DU bundles have been loaded in locations determined by manual intuition in an Indian PHWR and maximum permissible power of 93% full power (FP) was obtained. In the present paper, a modern evolutionary algorithm called estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) is used to improve upon this distribution. Optimum distributions of DU bundles which maximize K(eff) and give 100% FP without violating safety parameters such as maximum permissible bundle power, channel power, channel outlet temperature and permitted reactivity worths of shut-down systems are obtained. Another aspect studied in this paper is to find out how far one can increase the number of DU bundles loaded in the core. This will minimize the NU bundles requirement, extract more power from DU bundles and thus provide better fuel utilization. The idea is to conserve NU bundles. The optimum distribution of DU bundles has been obtained for the total number of DU bundles ranging from a few hundreds to a few thousands. It is found that, depending on various conditions, about 60-80% of the core can be loaded with DU bundles leading to a substantial saving in NU bundles. Some variation in the implementation of EDA to generate loading pattern of PHWR reactor core is also studied. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

This chapter introduces a novel hybrid Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) to solve the PSP problem on HP model. Firstly, a composite fitness function containing the information of folding structure core (H-Core) is introduced to replace the traditional fitness function of HP model. The new fitness function is expected to select better individuals for probabilistic model of EDA. Secondly, local search with guided operators is utilized to refine found solutions for improving efficiency of EDA. Thirdly, an improved backtracking-based repairing method is introduced to repair invalid individuals sampled by the probabilistic model of EDA. It can significantly reduce the number of backtracking searching operation and the computational cost for long sequence protein. Experimental results demonstrate that the new method outperforms the basic EDAs method. At the same time, it is very competitive with other existing algorithms for the PSP problem on lattice HP models.",

With a single probabilistic model, most existing continuous EDAs usually suffer from the local stagnation or a low convergence speed. This paper presents an enhanced continuous EDA with multiple probabilistic models (MP-EDA). In the MP-EDA, the population is divided into two subpopulations. The one involved by histogram model is used to roughly capture the global optima, whereas the other involved by Gaussian model is aimed at finding highly accurate solutions. During the evolution, a migration operation is periodically carried out to exchange some best individuals of the two subpopulations. Besides, the MP-EDA adaptively adjusts the offspring size of each subpopulation to improve the searching efficiency. The effectiveness of the MP-EDA is investigated by testing ten benchmark functions. Compared with several state-of-the-art evolutionary computations, the proposed algorithm can obtain better results in most test cases.",

On one hand, the characteristics of a real world problem are usually unknown. On the other hand, in different running stages of an EA, the best parameters may be different. Thus adaptively tuning algorithm parameters online is preferred. In this paper, we propose to use an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) to do this for a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The major characteristic of our approach is that there are two evolving processes simultaneously: one for tackling the original problem, and the other for optimizing PSO parameters. For the former evolving process, a set of particles are maintained; while for the later, a probability distribution model of the PSO parameters is maintained throughout the run. In the reproduction procedure, the PSO parameters are firstly sampled from the model, and then new particles are generated by the PSO operator. The feedback from the newly generated particles is used to evaluate the PSO parameters and thus to update the probability model. The new approach is applied to a set of test instances and the preliminary results are promising.",

Thus, this paper carries out an investigation on sampling technique for a novel multi-objective estimation of distribution algorithm - multi-objective restricted Boltzmann machine. Two variants of a new sampling technique based on energy value of the solutions in the trained network are proposed to improve the efficiency of the algorithm.

The optimal scheme is very helpful for investors in making decisions. However, finding the optimal scheme is difficult and time-consuming especially when the number of assets is large and some actual investment constraints are considered. This paper proposes a new approach based on estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) for solving a cardinality constrained portfolio selection (CCPS) problem. The proposed algorithm, termed PBILCCPS, hybridizes an EDA called population-based incremental learning (PBIL) algorithm and a continuous PBIL (PBILc) algorithm, to optimize the selection of assets and the allocation of capital respectively. The proposed algorithm adopts an adaptive parameter control strategy and an elitist strategy. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with a genetic algorithm and a particle swarm optimization algorithm. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve a satisfactory result for portfolio selection and perform well in searching nondominated portfolios with high expected returns.",

In EDA-based MA (EDAMA), both EDA-based searching operators and simulated annealing (SA) based local searching operators are designed to balance the exploration and exploitation abilities. On the other hand, global information provided by EDA is combined with local information from SA to create better solutions. In particular, to enrich the searching behaviors and to avoid premature convergence, SA-based local search is designed and incorporated into EDAMA. To balance the exploration and exploitation abilities, after the standard EDA-based searching operation, SA-based local search is probabilistically applied to some good solutions selected by using a roulette wheel mechanism with a specified probability. Numerical simulations based on Henon Map demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of EDAMA, and the effects of some parameters are investigated as well.",

In this paper we explore the ability of the Cell Broadband Engine to run two similar Estimation of Distribution Algorithms, one for the discrete domain and the other for the continuous domain. Starting from initial, sequential versions, we develop multi-threaded programs for symmetric multiprocessors that are afterwards reworked to run on a Cell-based system. In most cases, the parallel programs significantly accelerate execution times, compared with the sequential counterparts. Additional acceleration is achieved using vector (instead of scalar) operations, which are supported by all the tested platforms. We describe the process of paralle-lizing and porting the programs, and analyze the results obtained taking into account the EDAs under study, the problems solved with them, and the platform in which programs run. We conclude that EDAs are not right targets to be ported to the Cell Broadband Engine. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

In this paper, we introduce the affinity propagation EDA (AffEDA) which learns a marginal product model by clustering a matrix of mutual information learned from the data using a very efficient message-passing algorithm known as affinity propagation. The introduced algorithm is tested on a set of binary and nonbinary decomposable functions and using a hard combinatorial class of problem known as the HP protein model. The results show that the algorithm is a very efficient alternative to other EDAs that use marginal product model factorizations such as the extended compact genetic algorithm (ECGA) and improves the quality of the results achieved by ECGA when the cardinality of the variables is increased.",

        "description": "Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) are widely used in stochastic optimization. Impressive experimental results have been reported in the literature. However, little work has been done on analyzing the computation time of EDAs in relation to the problem size. It is still unclear how well EDAs (with a finite population size larger than two) will scale up when the dimension of the optimization problem (problem size) goes up. This paper studies the computational time complexity of a simple EDA, i.e., the univariate marginal distribution algorithm (UMDA), in order to gain more insight into EDAs complexity. First, we discuss how to measure the computational time complexity of EDAs. A classification of problem hardness based on our discussions is then given. Second, we prove a theorem related to problem hardness and the probability conditions of EDAs. Third, we propose a novel approach to analyzing the computational time complexity of UMDA using discrete dynamic systems and Chernoff bounds. Following this approach, we are able to derive a number of results on the first hitting time of UMDA on a well-known unimodal pseudo-boolean function, i.e., the LeadingOnes problem, and another problem derived from LeadingOnes, named BVLeadingOnes. Although both problems are unimodal, our analysis shows that LeadingOnes is easy for the UMDA, while BVLeadingOnes is hard for the UMDA. Finally, in order to address the key issue of what problem characteristics make a problem hard for UMDA, we discuss in depth the idea of \"margins\" (or relaxation). We prove theoretically that the UMDA with margins can solve the BVLeadingOnes problem efficiently.",

        "description": "The goal of this research is to deduce important guidelines for designing effective Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs). These guidelines will enhance the designed algorithms in balancing the intensification and diversification effects of EDAs. Most EDAs have the advantage of incorporating probabilistic models which can generate chromosomes with the non-disruption of salient genes. This advantage, however, may cause the problem of the premature convergence of EDAs resulted in the probabilistic models no longer generating diversified solutions. In addition, due to overfitting of the search space, probabilistic models cannot really represent the general information of the population. Therefore, this research will deduce important guidelines through the convergency speed analysis of EDAs under different computational times for designing effective EDA algorithms. The major idea is to increase the population diversity gradually by hybridizing EDAs with other meta-heuristics and replacing the procedures of sampling new solutions. According to that, this research further proposes an Adaptive EA/G to improve the performance of EA/G. The proposed algorithm solves the single machine scheduling problems with earliness/tardiness cost in a just-in-time scheduling environment. The experimental results indicated that the Adaptive EA/G outperforms ACGA and EA/G statistically significant in different stopping criteria. This paper, hence, is of importance in the field of EDAs as well as for the researchers in studying the scheduling problems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "description": "Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) are a set of techniques that belong to the field of Evolutionary Computation. They are similar to Genetic Algorithms (GAs), in the sense that, given a problem, they use a population of individuals to represent solutions, and this population is made to evolve towards the most promising solutions. However, instead of using the usual GA-operators such as mutation or crossover, EDAs learn a probabilistic model that tries to capture the main characteristics of the problem. Based on this idea, several EDAs have been introduced in the last years, showing a good performance and being able to solve problems of different complexity. One important drawback of EDAs is the significant computational effort required by the utilization of probabilistic models, when applied to real-world problems. This fact has led the research community to apply parallel schemes to EDAs, as a viable way to reduce execution times. Schemes already proposed for GAs have been used as the foundation for these parallel schemes. In this chapter, we make a review of parallel EDAs, with a main focus: identifying those parts that are susceptible of parallelization. Then we describe a collection of parallelization strategies proposed in the literature. Additionally, we provide some recommendations for those that are considering the implementation of parallel EDAs on state-of-the-art parallel computers.",

For example, it shows how the regularization of some parameters of the EDAs probabilistic models can yield dramatic improvements in efficiency. In this context a new class, Shrinkage EDAs, based on shrinkage estimation is presented. Also, a novel mutation operator based on a regularization of the entropy is discussed. Another key contribution of the chapter is the development of a new surrogate fitness model based on the search distributions. With this method the evolution starts in the fitness landscape, switches to the log-probability landscape of the model and then backtracks to continue in the original landscape if the optimum is not found. For the sake of completeness the chapter reviews other techniques for improving the sampling efficiency of EDAs. The theoretical presentation is accompanied by numerical simulations that support the main claims of the chapter.",

GNP uses multiple reusable nodes to construct directed-graph structures to represent its solutions. Recently, many research has clarified that GNP can work well in data mining area. In this paper, a novel evolutionary paradigm named GNP with Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (GNP-EDAs) is proposed and used to solve traffic prediction problems using class association rule mining. In GNP-EDAs, a probabilistic model is constructed by estimating the probability distribution from the selected elite individuals of the previous generation to replace the conventional genetic operators, such as crossover and mutation. The probabilistic model is capable of enhancing the evolution to achieve the ultimate objective. In this paper, two methods are proposed based on extracting the probabilistic information on the node connections and node transitions of GNP-EDAs to construct the probabilistic model. A comparative study of the proposed paradigm and the conventional GNP is made to solve the traffic prediction problems using class association rule mining. The simulation results showed that GNP-EDAs can extract the class association rules more effectively, when the number of the candidate class association rules increases. And the classification accuracy of the proposed method shows good results in traffic prediction systems.",

The emergent modelling is half theoretical - with respect to selection, completely characterized by stochastic calculus and half empirical - concerning the generation of new individuals.

However, the primary gap of EDAs is lock of diversity between individuals. Hence, we introduce the IAs that is a new branch in computational intelligence. The main concepts of IAs are suppression and hypermutation that make the individuals be more diversity. Moreover, the primary gap of IAs is to pay no attention to the relation between individuals.

PBIL includes many of the features from the genetic algorithm such as binary string representation, the notion of individuals, fitness measures and mutations. Contrary to the genetic algorithm it does not maintain a population of individuals but instead PBIL contains a probability vector. At each generation a new population of individuals is sampled according to the probabilities specified in the probability vector. The population is evaluated and the probability vector is updated by dragging it towards the best individual in the population. In recent years, the investigation of synchronization of chaotic systems has attracted much attention of researchers. Chaos synchronization has been applied in many fields such as secure communication, chemical, engineering, and biological systems, among others. This paper presents the synchronization of two identical discrete chaotic systems subject the different initial conditions by designing a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. In addition, the tuning of the PID controller based on a modified PBIL algorithm using similarity analysis is also investigated in this paper. Simulation results show the good performance of the modified PBIL algorithm for synchronization of chaotic systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "description": "Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a stochastic optimization approach that originated from simulations of bird flocking, and that has been successfully used in many applications as an optimization tool. Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) are a class of evolutionary algorithms which perform a two-step process: building a probabilistic model from which good solutions may be generated and then using this model to generate new individuals. Two distinct research trends that emerged in the past few years are the hybridization of PSO and EDA algorithms and the parallelization of EDAs to exploit the idea of exchanging the probabilistic model information. In this work, we propose the use of a cooperative PSO/EDA algorithm based on the exchange of heterogeneous probabilistic models. The model is heterogeneous because the cooperating PSO/EDA algorithms use different methods to sample the search space. Three different exchange approaches are tested and compared in this work. In all these approaches, the amount of information exchanged is adapted based on the performance of the two cooperating swarms. The performance of the cooperative model is compared to the existing state-of-the-art PSO cooperative approaches using a suite of well-known benchmark optimization functions.",

This paper investigates three commonly used metrics, nonlinearity, simultaneity, and entropy. Then it proposes a new interaction-detection metric which aims at what GAs really need. The proposed metric, namely the differential mutual complement, is based on both the disruption and reproduction effects of the crossover operator on significant schemata.

We apply this methodology to investigate the specific issue of explicit dependency modelling in simple continuous Estimation of Distribution Algorithms. Experimental results reveal specific examples of landscapes (with certain identifiable features) where dependency modelling is useful, harmful or has little impact on average algorithm performance. The results are related to some previous intuition about the behaviour of these algorithms, but at the same time lead to new insights into the relationship between dependency modelling in EDAs and the structure of the problem landscape.

This paper presents a new model building approach, called ClusterMI, inspired both by the Extended Compact Genetic Algorithm and the Dependency Structure Matrix Genetic Algorithm. The new approach has a more efficient model building process, resulting in speed ups of 10 times for moderate size problems and potentially hundreds of times for large problems.

In this study, we make an attempt to enable a perturbation-based method, inductive linkage identification (ILI), to detect general problem structures, in which one decision variable can link to an arbitrary number of other variables. Experiments on circular problem structures composed of order-4 and order-5 trap functions are conducted.

The multi-population approach is used to locate multiple local optima which are useful to find the global optimal solution quickly to dynamic multimodal problems. The diffusion model is used to increase the diversity in a guided fashion, which makes the neighbor individuals of previous optimal solutions move gradually from the previous optimal solutions and enlarge the search space. This approach uses both the information of current population and the part history information of the optimal solutions. Finally experimental studies on the moving peaks benchmark are carried out to evaluate the proposed algorithm and compare the performance of MDUMDA and multi-population quantum swarm optimization (MQSO) from the literature.

In this paper, we study the behavior of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) in functions whose structure is defined by using different network topologies which include grids, small-world networks and random graphs. In order to do that, we use several descriptors such as the population size, the number of evaluations as well as the structures learned during the search. Furthermore, we take measures from the field of complex networks such as clustering coefficient or characteristic path length in order to quantify the topological properties of the function structure and analyze their relation with the behavior of EDAs. The results show that these measures are useful to have better understanding of this type of algorithms which have exhibited a high sensitivity to the topological characteristics of the function structure.

        "description": "Recent years have seen an increasing interest in Markov networks as an alternative approach to probabilistic modelling in estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). Distribution Estimation Using Markov network (DEUM) is one of the early EDAs to use this approach. Over the years, several different versions of DEUM have been proposed using different Markov network structures, and are shown to work well in a number of different optimisation problems. One of the key similarities between all of the DEUM algorithms proposed so far is that they all assume the interaction between variables in the problem to be pre-given. In other words, they do not learn the structure of Markov network, and assume that it is known in advance. This work presents a recent development in DEUM framework - a fully multivariate DEUM algorithm that can automatically learn the undirected structure of the problem, automatically find the cliques from the structure and automatically estimate a joint probability model of the Markov network. This model is then sampled using Monte Carlo samplers. The chapter also reviews some of the key works on use of Markov networks in EDAs, and explains the fitness modelling concept used by DEUM. The proposed DEUM algorithm can be applied to any general optimisation problems even when the structure is not known.",

This representation allows for the state of an entire ipESNN at any time to be represented probabilistically in a quantum bit register and probabilistically optimised until convergence using quantum gate operators and a fitness function. The proposed ipESNN is a promising framework for both engineering applications and brain data modeling as it offers faster and more efficient feature selection and model optimization in a large dimensional space in addition to revealing new knowledge that is not possible to obtain using other models.

The framework used is the standard Markowitz mean-variance formulation for portfolio optimization with constraints of practical interest, such as minimum and maximum investments per asset and/or on groups of assets. Imposing limits on the number of different assets that can be included in the investment transforms portfolio selection into an NP-complete mixed-integer quadratic optimization problem that is difficult to solve by standard methods. An implementation of the algorithm that employs a genetic algorithm with a set representation, an appropriately defined mutation operator and Random Assortment Recombination for crossover (RAR-GA) is compared with implementations using Simulated Annealing (SA) and various Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs). An empirical investigation of the performance of the portfolios selected with these different methods using financial data shows that RAR-GA and SA are superior to the implementations with EDAs in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. The use of pruning heuristics that effectively reduce the dimensionality of the problem by identifying and eliminating from the universe of investment assets that are not expected to appear in the optimal portfolio leads to significant improvements in performance and makes EDAs competitive with RAR-GA and SA.",

For that reason, in this work we exploit the probabilistic models that EDAs based on Bayesian networks are able to learn in order to provide new information about their behavior. Particularly, we analyze the k solutions with the highest probability in the distributions estimated during the search. In order to study the relationship between the probabilistic model and the fitness function, we focus on calculating, for the k most probable solutions (MPSs), the probability values, the function values and the correlation between both sets of values at each step of the algorithm. Furthermore, the objective functions of the k MPSs are contrasted with the k best individuals in the population. We complete the analysis by calculating the position of the optimum in the k MPSs during the search and the genotypic diversity of these solutions. We carry out the analysis by optimizing functions of different natures such as Trap5, two variants of Ising spin glass and Max-SAT. The results not only show information about the relationship between the probabilistic model and the fitness function, but also allow us to observe characteristics of the search space, the quality of the setup of the parameters and even distinguish between successful and unsuccessful runs.",

We describe the process of paralle-lizing and porting the programs, and analyze the results obtained taking into account the EDAs under study, the problems solved with them, and the platform in which programs run. We conclude that EDAs are not right targets to be ported to the Cell Broadband Engine. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

In this paper, we introduce the affinity propagation EDA (AffEDA) which learns a marginal product model by clustering a matrix of mutual information learned from the data using a very efficient message-passing algorithm known as affinity propagation. The introduced algorithm is tested on a set of binary and nonbinary decomposable functions and using a hard combinatorial class of problem known as the HP protein model. The results show that the algorithm is a very efficient alternative to other EDAs that use marginal product model factorizations such as the extended compact genetic algorithm (ECGA) and improves the quality of the results achieved by ECGA when the cardinality of the variables is increased.",

        "description": "Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) are widely used in stochastic optimization. Impressive experimental results have been reported in the literature. However, little work has been done on analyzing the computation time of EDAs in relation to the problem size. It is still unclear how well EDAs (with a finite population size larger than two) will scale up when the dimension of the optimization problem (problem size) goes up. This paper studies the computational time complexity of a simple EDA, i.e., the univariate marginal distribution algorithm (UMDA), in order to gain more insight into EDAs complexity. First, we discuss how to measure the computational time complexity of EDAs. A classification of problem hardness based on our discussions is then given. Second, we prove a theorem related to problem hardness and the probability conditions of EDAs. Third, we propose a novel approach to analyzing the computational time complexity of UMDA using discrete dynamic systems and Chernoff bounds. Following this approach, we are able to derive a number of results on the first hitting time of UMDA on a well-known unimodal pseudo-boolean function, i.e., the LeadingOnes problem, and another problem derived from LeadingOnes, named BVLeadingOnes. Although both problems are unimodal, our analysis shows that LeadingOnes is easy for the UMDA, while BVLeadingOnes is hard for the UMDA. Finally, in order to address the key issue of what problem characteristics make a problem hard for UMDA, we discuss in depth the idea of \"margins\" (or relaxation). We prove theoretically that the UMDA with margins can solve the BVLeadingOnes problem efficiently.",

        "description": "The goal of this research is to deduce important guidelines for designing effective Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs). These guidelines will enhance the designed algorithms in balancing the intensification and diversification effects of EDAs. Most EDAs have the advantage of incorporating probabilistic models which can generate chromosomes with the non-disruption of salient genes. This advantage, however, may cause the problem of the premature convergence of EDAs resulted in the probabilistic models no longer generating diversified solutions. In addition, due to overfitting of the search space, probabilistic models cannot really represent the general information of the population. Therefore, this research will deduce important guidelines through the convergency speed analysis of EDAs under different computational times for designing effective EDA algorithms. The major idea is to increase the population diversity gradually by hybridizing EDAs with other meta-heuristics and replacing the procedures of sampling new solutions. According to that, this research further proposes an Adaptive EA/G to improve the performance of EA/G. The proposed algorithm solves the single machine scheduling problems with earliness/tardiness cost in a just-in-time scheduling environment. The experimental results indicated that the Adaptive EA/G outperforms ACGA and EA/G statistically significant in different stopping criteria. This paper, hence, is of importance in the field of EDAs as well as for the researchers in studying the scheduling problems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "description": "Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) are a set of techniques that belong to the field of Evolutionary Computation. They are similar to Genetic Algorithms (GAs), in the sense that, given a problem, they use a population of individuals to represent solutions, and this population is made to evolve towards the most promising solutions. However, instead of using the usual GA-operators such as mutation or crossover, EDAs learn a probabilistic model that tries to capture the main characteristics of the problem. Based on this idea, several EDAs have been introduced in the last years, showing a good performance and being able to solve problems of different complexity. One important drawback of EDAs is the significant computational effort required by the utilization of probabilistic models, when applied to real-world problems. This fact has led the research community to apply parallel schemes to EDAs, as a viable way to reduce execution times. Schemes already proposed for GAs have been used as the foundation for these parallel schemes. In this chapter, we make a review of parallel EDAs, with a main focus: identifying those parts that are susceptible of parallelization. Then we describe a collection of parallelization strategies proposed in the literature. Additionally, we provide some recommendations for those that are considering the implementation of parallel EDAs on state-of-the-art parallel computers.",

For example, it shows how the regularization of some parameters of the EDAs probabilistic models can yield dramatic improvements in efficiency. In this context a new class, Shrinkage EDAs, based on shrinkage estimation is presented. Also, a novel mutation operator based on a regularization of the entropy is discussed. Another key contribution of the chapter is the development of a new surrogate fitness model based on the search distributions. With this method the evolution starts in the fitness landscape, switches to the log-probability landscape of the model and then backtracks to continue in the original landscape if the optimum is not found. For the sake of completeness the chapter reviews other techniques for improving the sampling efficiency of EDAs. The theoretical presentation is accompanied by numerical simulations that support the main claims of the chapter.",

GNP uses multiple reusable nodes to construct directed-graph structures to represent its solutions. Recently, many research has clarified that GNP can work well in data mining area. In this paper, a novel evolutionary paradigm named GNP with Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (GNP-EDAs) is proposed and used to solve traffic prediction problems using class association rule mining. In GNP-EDAs, a probabilistic model is constructed by estimating the probability distribution from the selected elite individuals of the previous generation to replace the conventional genetic operators, such as crossover and mutation. The probabilistic model is capable of enhancing the evolution to achieve the ultimate objective. In this paper, two methods are proposed based on extracting the probabilistic information on the node connections and node transitions of GNP-EDAs to construct the probabilistic model. A comparative study of the proposed paradigm and the conventional GNP is made to solve the traffic prediction problems using class association rule mining. The simulation results showed that GNP-EDAs can extract the class association rules more effectively, when the number of the candidate class association rules increases. And the classification accuracy of the proposed method shows good results in traffic prediction systems.",

The emergent modelling is half theoretical - with respect to selection, completely characterized by stochastic calculus and half empirical - concerning the generation of new individuals.

It adopts the distribution of selected individuals in search space and models the probability distributions to generate the next population. However, the primary gap of EDAs is lock of diversity between individuals. Hence, we introduce the IAs that is a new branch in computational intelligence. The main concepts of IAs are suppression and hypermutation that make the individuals be more diversity. Moreover, the primary gap of IAs is to pay no attention to the relation between individuals.

In recent years, a new class of EAs called estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) has emerged based on probabilistic modeling of the search space. Instances of EDAs include population based incremental learning (PBIL) algorithm. The PBIL algorithm is an easy to understand heuristic optimization technique that is inspired by the genetic algorithm and the competitive learning paradigm. PBIL includes many of the features from the genetic algorithm such as binary string representation, the notion of individuals, fitness measures and mutations. Contrary to the genetic algorithm it does not maintain a population of individuals but instead PBIL contains a probability vector. At each generation a new population of individuals is sampled according to the probabilities specified in the probability vector. The population is evaluated and the probability vector is updated by dragging it towards the best individual in the population. In recent years, the investigation of synchronization of chaotic systems has attracted much attention of researchers. Chaos synchronization has been applied in many fields such as secure communication, chemical, engineering, and biological systems, among others. This paper presents the synchronization of two identical discrete chaotic systems subject the different initial conditions by designing a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller.

        "description": "Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a stochastic optimization approach that originated from simulations of bird flocking, and that has been successfully used in many applications as an optimization tool. Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) are a class of evolutionary algorithms which perform a two-step process: building a probabilistic model from which good solutions may be generated and then using this model to generate new individuals. Two distinct research trends that emerged in the past few years are the hybridization of PSO and EDA algorithms and the parallelization of EDAs to exploit the idea of exchanging the probabilistic model information. In this work, we propose the use of a cooperative PSO/EDA algorithm based on the exchange of heterogeneous probabilistic models. The model is heterogeneous because the cooperating PSO/EDA algorithms use different methods to sample the search space. Three different exchange approaches are tested and compared in this work. In all these approaches, the amount of information exchanged is adapted based on the performance of the two cooperating swarms. The performance of the cooperative model is compared to the existing state-of-the-art PSO cooperative approaches using a suite of well-known benchmark optimization functions.",

This paper investigates three commonly used metrics, nonlinearity, simultaneity, and entropy. Then it proposes a new interaction-detection metric which aims at what GAs really need. The proposed metric, namely the differential mutual complement, is based on both the disruption and reproduction effects of the crossover operator on significant schemata.

We apply this methodology to investigate the specific issue of explicit dependency modelling in simple continuous Estimation of Distribution Algorithms. Experimental results reveal specific examples of landscapes (with certain identifiable features) where dependency modelling is useful, harmful or has little impact on average algorithm performance. The results are related to some previous intuition about the behaviour of these algorithms, but at the same time lead to new insights into the relationship between dependency modelling in EDAs and the structure of the problem landscape. The overall methodology is quite general and could be used to examine specific features of other algorithms.",

Estimation of Distribution Algorithms, a special class of Genetic Algorithms, can build complex models of the iterations among variables in the problem, solving several intractable problems in tractable polynomial time. However, the model building process can be computationally expensive and efficiency enhancements are oftentimes necessary to make tractable problems practical. This paper presents a new model building approach, called ClusterMI, inspired both by the Extended Compact Genetic Algorithm and the Dependency Structure Matrix Genetic Algorithm. The new approach has a more efficient model building process, resulting in speed ups of 10 times for moderate size problems and potentially hundreds of times for large problems.

One of the major development trends to improve genetic algorithms is trying to extract and exploit the relationship among decision variables, such as estimation of distribution algorithms and perturbation-based methods. In this study, we make an attempt to enable a perturbation-based method, inductive linkage identification (ILI), to detect general problem structures, in which one decision variable can link to an arbitrary number of other variables. Experiments on circular problem structures composed of order-4 and order-5 trap functions are conducted. The results indicate that the proposed technique requires a population size growing logarithmically with the problem size as the original ILI does on non-overlapping building blocks as well as that the population requirement is insensitive to the problem structure consisting of similar substructures as long as the overall problem size is identical.",

Univariate marginal distribution algorithm (UMDA) which is a class algorithm of estimation of distribution algorithms attracts more and more attention in recent years. In this paper a new multi-population and diffusion UMDA (MDUMDA) is proposed for dynamic multimodal problems. The multi-population approach is used to locate multiple local optima which are useful to find the global optimal solution quickly to dynamic multimodal problems. The diffusion model is used to increase the diversity in a guided fashion, which makes the neighbor individuals of previous optimal solutions move gradually from the previous optimal solutions and enlarge the search space. This approach uses both the information of current population and the part history information of the optimal solutions. Finally experimental studies on the moving peaks benchmark are carried out to evaluate the proposed algorithm and compare the performance of MDUMDA and multi-population quantum swarm optimization (MQSO) from the literature. The experimental results show that the MDUMDA is effective for the function with moving optimum and can adapt to the dynamic environments rapidly.",

In this paper, we study the behavior of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) in functions whose structure is defined by using different network topologies which include grids, small-world networks and random graphs. In order to do that, we use several descriptors such as the population size, the number of evaluations as well as the structures learned during the search. Furthermore, we take measures from the field of complex networks such as clustering coefficient or characteristic path length in order to quantify the topological properties of the function structure and analyze their relation with the behavior of EDAs. The results show that these measures are useful to have better understanding of this type of algorithms which have exhibited a high sensitivity to the topological characteristics of the function structure.

        "description": "Recent years have seen an increasing interest in Markov networks as an alternative approach to probabilistic modelling in estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). Distribution Estimation Using Markov network (DEUM) is one of the early EDAs to use this approach. Over the years, several different versions of DEUM have been proposed using different Markov network structures, and are shown to work well in a number of different optimisation problems. One of the key similarities between all of the DEUM algorithms proposed so far is that they all assume the interaction between variables in the problem to be pre-given. In other words, they do not learn the structure of Markov network, and assume that it is known in advance. This work presents a recent development in DEUM framework - a fully multivariate DEUM algorithm that can automatically learn the undirected structure of the problem, automatically find the cliques from the structure and automatically estimate a joint probability model of the Markov network. This model is then sampled using Monte Carlo samplers. The chapter also reviews some of the key works on use of Markov networks in EDAs, and explains the fitness modelling concept used by DEUM. The proposed DEUM algorithm can be applied to any general optimisation problems even when the structure is not known.",

Both spikes and input features in ipESNN are represented as quantum bits being in a superposition of two states (1 and 0) defined by a probability density function. This representation allows for the state of an entire ipESNN at any time to be represented probabilistically in a quantum bit register and probabilistically optimised until convergence using quantum gate operators and a fitness function. The proposed ipESNN is a promising framework for both engineering applications and brain data modeling as it offers faster and more efficient feature selection and model optimization in a large dimensional space in addition to revealing new knowledge that is not possible to obtain using other models.

The framework used is the standard Markowitz mean-variance formulation for portfolio optimization with constraints of practical interest, such as minimum and maximum investments per asset and/or on groups of assets. Imposing limits on the number of different assets that can be included in the investment transforms portfolio selection into an NP-complete mixed-integer quadratic optimization problem that is difficult to solve by standard methods. An implementation of the algorithm that employs a genetic algorithm with a set representation, an appropriately defined mutation operator and Random Assortment Recombination for crossover (RAR-GA) is compared with implementations using Simulated Annealing (SA) and various Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs). An empirical investigation of the performance of the portfolios selected with these different methods using financial data shows that RAR-GA and SA are superior to the implementations with EDAs in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. The use of pruning heuristics that effectively reduce the dimensionality of the problem by identifying and eliminating from the universe of investment assets that are not expected to appear in the optimal portfolio leads to significant improvements in performance and makes EDAs competitive with RAR-GA and SA.",

For that reason, in this work we exploit the probabilistic models that EDAs based on Bayesian networks are able to learn in order to provide new information about their behavior. Particularly, we analyze the k solutions with the highest probability in the distributions estimated during the search. In order to study the relationship between the probabilistic model and the fitness function, we focus on calculating, for the k most probable solutions (MPSs), the probability values, the function values and the correlation between both sets of values at each step of the algorithm. Furthermore, the objective functions of the k MPSs are contrasted with the k best individuals in the population. We complete the analysis by calculating the position of the optimum in the k MPSs during the search and the genotypic diversity of these solutions. We carry out the analysis by optimizing functions of different natures such as Trap5, two variants of Ising spin glass and Max-SAT. The results not only show information about the relationship between the probabilistic model and the fitness function, but also allow us to observe characteristics of the search space, the quality of the setup of the parameters and even distinguish between successful and unsuccessful runs.",

In this paper, we introduce the affinity propagation EDA (AffEDA) which learns a marginal product model by clustering a matrix of mutual information learned from the data using a very efficient message-passing algorithm known as affinity propagation. The introduced algorithm is tested on a set of binary and nonbinary decomposable functions and using a hard combinatorial class of problem known as the HP protein model. The results show that the algorithm is a very efficient alternative to other EDAs that use marginal product model factorizations such as the extended compact genetic algorithm (ECGA) and improves the quality of the results achieved by ECGA when the cardinality of the variables is increased.",

        "description": "Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) are widely used in stochastic optimization. Impressive experimental results have been reported in the literature. However, little work has been done on analyzing the computation time of EDAs in relation to the problem size. It is still unclear how well EDAs (with a finite population size larger than two) will scale up when the dimension of the optimization problem (problem size) goes up. This paper studies the computational time complexity of a simple EDA, i.e., the univariate marginal distribution algorithm (UMDA), in order to gain more insight into EDAs complexity. First, we discuss how to measure the computational time complexity of EDAs. A classification of problem hardness based on our discussions is then given. Second, we prove a theorem related to problem hardness and the probability conditions of EDAs. Third, we propose a novel approach to analyzing the computational time complexity of UMDA using discrete dynamic systems and Chernoff bounds. Following this approach, we are able to derive a number of results on the first hitting time of UMDA on a well-known unimodal pseudo-boolean function, i.e., the LeadingOnes problem, and another problem derived from LeadingOnes, named BVLeadingOnes. Although both problems are unimodal, our analysis shows that LeadingOnes is easy for the UMDA, while BVLeadingOnes is hard for the UMDA. Finally, in order to address the key issue of what problem characteristics make a problem hard for UMDA, we discuss in depth the idea of \"margins\" (or relaxation). We prove theoretically that the UMDA with margins can solve the BVLeadingOnes problem efficiently.",

        "description": "The goal of this research is to deduce important guidelines for designing effective Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs). These guidelines will enhance the designed algorithms in balancing the intensification and diversification effects of EDAs. Most EDAs have the advantage of incorporating probabilistic models which can generate chromosomes with the non-disruption of salient genes. This advantage, however, may cause the problem of the premature convergence of EDAs resulted in the probabilistic models no longer generating diversified solutions. In addition, due to overfitting of the search space, probabilistic models cannot really represent the general information of the population. Therefore, this research will deduce important guidelines through the convergency speed analysis of EDAs under different computational times for designing effective EDA algorithms. The major idea is to increase the population diversity gradually by hybridizing EDAs with other meta-heuristics and replacing the procedures of sampling new solutions. According to that, this research further proposes an Adaptive EA/G to improve the performance of EA/G. The proposed algorithm solves the single machine scheduling problems with earliness/tardiness cost in a just-in-time scheduling environment. The experimental results indicated that the Adaptive EA/G outperforms ACGA and EA/G statistically significant in different stopping criteria. This paper, hence, is of importance in the field of EDAs as well as for the researchers in studying the scheduling problems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "description": "Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) are a set of techniques that belong to the field of Evolutionary Computation. They are similar to Genetic Algorithms (GAs), in the sense that, given a problem, they use a population of individuals to represent solutions, and this population is made to evolve towards the most promising solutions. However, instead of using the usual GA-operators such as mutation or crossover, EDAs learn a probabilistic model that tries to capture the main characteristics of the problem. Based on this idea, several EDAs have been introduced in the last years, showing a good performance and being able to solve problems of different complexity. One important drawback of EDAs is the significant computational effort required by the utilization of probabilistic models, when applied to real-world problems. This fact has led the research community to apply parallel schemes to EDAs, as a viable way to reduce execution times. Schemes already proposed for GAs have been used as the foundation for these parallel schemes. In this chapter, we make a review of parallel EDAs, with a main focus: identifying those parts that are susceptible of parallelization. Then we describe a collection of parallelization strategies proposed in the literature. Additionally, we provide some recommendations for those that are considering the implementation of parallel EDAs on state-of-the-art parallel computers.",

For example, it shows how the regularization of some parameters of the EDAs probabilistic models can yield dramatic improvements in efficiency. In this context a new class, Shrinkage EDAs, based on shrinkage estimation is presented. Also, a novel mutation operator based on a regularization of the entropy is discussed. Another key contribution of the chapter is the development of a new surrogate fitness model based on the search distributions. With this method the evolution starts in the fitness landscape, switches to the log-probability landscape of the model and then backtracks to continue in the original landscape if the optimum is not found. For the sake of completeness the chapter reviews other techniques for improving the sampling efficiency of EDAs. The theoretical presentation is accompanied by numerical simulations that support the main claims of the chapter.",

GNP uses multiple reusable nodes to construct directed-graph structures to represent its solutions. Recently, many research has clarified that GNP can work well in data mining area. In this paper, a novel evolutionary paradigm named GNP with Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (GNP-EDAs) is proposed and used to solve traffic prediction problems using class association rule mining. In GNP-EDAs, a probabilistic model is constructed by estimating the probability distribution from the selected elite individuals of the previous generation to replace the conventional genetic operators, such as crossover and mutation. The probabilistic model is capable of enhancing the evolution to achieve the ultimate objective. In this paper, two methods are proposed based on extracting the probabilistic information on the node connections and node transitions of GNP-EDAs to construct the probabilistic model. A comparative study of the proposed paradigm and the conventional GNP is made to solve the traffic prediction problems using class association rule mining. The simulation results showed that GNP-EDAs can extract the class association rules more effectively, when the number of the candidate class association rules increases. And the classification accuracy of the proposed method shows good results in traffic prediction systems.",

The emergent modelling is half theoretical - with respect to selection, completely characterized by stochastic calculus and half empirical - concerning the generation of new individuals.

It adopts the distribution of selected individuals in search space and models the probability distributions to generate the next population. However, the primary gap of EDAs is lock of diversity between individuals. Hence, we introduce the IAs that is a new branch in computational intelligence. The main concepts of IAs are suppression and hypermutation that make the individuals be more diversity. Moreover, the primary gap of IAs is to pay no attention to the relation between individuals.

In recent years, a new class of EAs called estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) has emerged based on probabilistic modeling of the search space. Instances of EDAs include population based incremental learning (PBIL) algorithm. The PBIL algorithm is an easy to understand heuristic optimization technique that is inspired by the genetic algorithm and the competitive learning paradigm. PBIL includes many of the features from the genetic algorithm such as binary string representation, the notion of individuals, fitness measures and mutations. Contrary to the genetic algorithm it does not maintain a population of individuals but instead PBIL contains a probability vector. At each generation a new population of individuals is sampled according to the probabilities specified in the probability vector. The population is evaluated and the probability vector is updated by dragging it towards the best individual in the population. In recent years, the investigation of synchronization of chaotic systems has attracted much attention of researchers. Chaos synchronization has been applied in many fields such as secure communication, chemical, engineering, and biological systems, among others. This paper presents the synchronization of two identical discrete chaotic systems subject the different initial conditions by designing a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. In addition, the tuning of the PID controller based on a modified PBIL algorithm using similarity analysis is also investigated in this paper.

Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) are a class of evolutionary algorithms which perform a two-step process: building a probabilistic model from which good solutions may be generated and then using this model to generate new individuals. Two distinct research trends that emerged in the past few years are the hybridization of PSO and EDA algorithms and the parallelization of EDAs to exploit the idea of exchanging the probabilistic model information. In this work, we propose the use of a cooperative PSO/EDA algorithm based on the exchange of heterogeneous probabilistic models. The model is heterogeneous because the cooperating PSO/EDA algorithms use different methods to sample the search space. Three different exchange approaches are tested and compared in this work. In all these approaches, the amount of information exchanged is adapted based on the performance of the two cooperating swarms. The performance of the cooperative model is compared to the existing state-of-the-art PSO cooperative approaches using a suite of well-known benchmark optimization functions.",

Empirical studies demonstrate that both GA and EDA are successful in finding good solutions in price optimizing and speed optimizing negotiation, respectively. However, both are not successful in price and speed concurrent optimizing (P-S-Optimizing) negotiation.

This paper investigates three commonly used metrics, nonlinearity, simultaneity, and entropy. Then it proposes a new interaction-detection metric which aims at what GAs really need. The proposed metric, namely the differential mutual complement, is based on both the disruption and reproduction effects of the crossover operator on significant schemata.

We apply this methodology to investigate the specific issue of explicit dependency modelling in simple continuous Estimation of Distribution Algorithms. Experimental results reveal specific examples of landscapes (with certain identifiable features) where dependency modelling is useful, harmful or has little impact on average algorithm performance. The results are related to some previous intuition about the behaviour of these algorithms, but at the same time lead to new insights into the relationship between dependency modelling in EDAs and the structure of the problem landscape. The overall methodology is quite general and could be used to examine specific features of other algorithms.",

Estimation of Distribution Algorithms, a special class of Genetic Algorithms, can build complex models of the iterations among variables in the problem, solving several intractable problems in tractable polynomial time. However, the model building process can be computationally expensive and efficiency enhancements are oftentimes necessary to make tractable problems practical. This paper presents a new model building approach, called ClusterMI, inspired both by the Extended Compact Genetic Algorithm and the Dependency Structure Matrix Genetic Algorithm. The new approach has a more efficient model building process, resulting in speed ups of 10 times for moderate size problems and potentially hundreds of times for large problems.

One of the major development trends to improve genetic algorithms is trying to extract and exploit the relationship among decision variables, such as estimation of distribution algorithms and perturbation-based methods. In this study, we make an attempt to enable a perturbation-based method, inductive linkage identification (ILI), to detect general problem structures, in which one decision variable can link to an arbitrary number of other variables. Experiments on circular problem structures composed of order-4 and order-5 trap functions are conducted. The results indicate that the proposed technique requires a population size growing logarithmically with the problem size as the original ILI does on non-overlapping building blocks as well as that the population requirement is insensitive to the problem structure consisting of similar substructures as long as the overall problem size is identical.",

Univariate marginal distribution algorithm (UMDA) which is a class algorithm of estimation of distribution algorithms attracts more and more attention in recent years. In this paper a new multi-population and diffusion UMDA (MDUMDA) is proposed for dynamic multimodal problems. The multi-population approach is used to locate multiple local optima which are useful to find the global optimal solution quickly to dynamic multimodal problems. The diffusion model is used to increase the diversity in a guided fashion, which makes the neighbor individuals of previous optimal solutions move gradually from the previous optimal solutions and enlarge the search space. This approach uses both the information of current population and the part history information of the optimal solutions. Finally experimental studies on the moving peaks benchmark are carried out to evaluate the proposed algorithm and compare the performance of MDUMDA and multi-population quantum swarm optimization (MQSO) from the literature. The experimental results show that the MDUMDA is effective for the function with moving optimum and can adapt to the dynamic environments rapidly.",

In this paper, we study the behavior of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) in functions whose structure is defined by using different network topologies which include grids, small-world networks and random graphs. In order to do that, we use several descriptors such as the population size, the number of evaluations as well as the structures learned during the search. Furthermore, we take measures from the field of complex networks such as clustering coefficient or characteristic path length in order to quantify the topological properties of the function structure and analyze their relation with the behavior of EDAs. The results show that these measures are useful to have better understanding of this type of algorithms which have exhibited a high sensitivity to the topological characteristics of the function structure.

        "description": "Recent years have seen an increasing interest in Markov networks as an alternative approach to probabilistic modelling in estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). Distribution Estimation Using Markov network (DEUM) is one of the early EDAs to use this approach. Over the years, several different versions of DEUM have been proposed using different Markov network structures, and are shown to work well in a number of different optimisation problems. One of the key similarities between all of the DEUM algorithms proposed so far is that they all assume the interaction between variables in the problem to be pre-given. In other words, they do not learn the structure of Markov network, and assume that it is known in advance. This work presents a recent development in DEUM framework - a fully multivariate DEUM algorithm that can automatically learn the undirected structure of the problem, automatically find the cliques from the structure and automatically estimate a joint probability model of the Markov network. This model is then sampled using Monte Carlo samplers. The chapter also reviews some of the key works on use of Markov networks in EDAs, and explains the fitness modelling concept used by DEUM. The proposed DEUM algorithm can be applied to any general optimisation problems even when the structure is not known.",

Both spikes and input features in ipESNN are represented as quantum bits being in a superposition of two states (1 and 0) defined by a probability density function. This representation allows for the state of an entire ipESNN at any time to be represented probabilistically in a quantum bit register and probabilistically optimised until convergence using quantum gate operators and a fitness function. The proposed ipESNN is a promising framework for both engineering applications and brain data modeling as it offers faster and more efficient feature selection and model optimization in a large dimensional space in addition to revealing new knowledge that is not possible to obtain using other models.

The framework used is the standard Markowitz mean-variance formulation for portfolio optimization with constraints of practical interest, such as minimum and maximum investments per asset and/or on groups of assets. Imposing limits on the number of different assets that can be included in the investment transforms portfolio selection into an NP-complete mixed-integer quadratic optimization problem that is difficult to solve by standard methods. An implementation of the algorithm that employs a genetic algorithm with a set representation, an appropriately defined mutation operator and Random Assortment Recombination for crossover (RAR-GA) is compared with implementations using Simulated Annealing (SA) and various Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs). An empirical investigation of the performance of the portfolios selected with these different methods using financial data shows that RAR-GA and SA are superior to the implementations with EDAs in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. The use of pruning heuristics that effectively reduce the dimensionality of the problem by identifying and eliminating from the universe of investment assets that are not expected to appear in the optimal portfolio leads to significant improvements in performance and makes EDAs competitive with RAR-GA and SA.",

Particularly, we analyze the k solutions with the highest probability in the distributions estimated during the search. In order to study the relationship between the probabilistic model and the fitness function, we focus on calculating, for the k most probable solutions (MPSs), the probability values, the function values and the correlation between both sets of values at each step of the algorithm. Furthermore, the objective functions of the k MPSs are contrasted with the k best individuals in the population. We complete the analysis by calculating the position of the optimum in the k MPSs during the search and the genotypic diversity of these solutions. We carry out the analysis by optimizing functions of different natures such as Trap5, two variants of Ising spin glass and Max-SAT. The results not only show information about the relationship between the probabilistic model and the fitness function, but also allow us to observe characteristics of the search space, the quality of the setup of the parameters and even distinguish between successful and unsuccessful runs.",

        "description": "Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) that use marginal product model factorizations have been widely applied to a broad range of mainly binary optimization problems. In this paper, we introduce the affinity propagation EDA (AffEDA) which learns a marginal product model by clustering a matrix of mutual information learned from the data using a very efficient message-passing algorithm known as affinity propagation. The introduced algorithm is tested on a set of binary and nonbinary decomposable functions and using a hard combinatorial class of problem known as the HP protein model. The results show that the algorithm is a very efficient alternative to other EDAs that use marginal product model factorizations such as the extended compact genetic algorithm (ECGA) and improves the quality of the results achieved by ECGA when the cardinality of the variables is increased.",

        "description": "Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) are widely used in stochastic optimization. Impressive experimental results have been reported in the literature. However, little work has been done on analyzing the computation time of EDAs in relation to the problem size. It is still unclear how well EDAs (with a finite population size larger than two) will scale up when the dimension of the optimization problem (problem size) goes up. This paper studies the computational time complexity of a simple EDA, i.e., the univariate marginal distribution algorithm (UMDA), in order to gain more insight into EDAs complexity. First, we discuss how to measure the computational time complexity of EDAs. A classification of problem hardness based on our discussions is then given. Second, we prove a theorem related to problem hardness and the probability conditions of EDAs. Third, we propose a novel approach to analyzing the computational time complexity of UMDA using discrete dynamic systems and Chernoff bounds. Following this approach, we are able to derive a number of results on the first hitting time of UMDA on a well-known unimodal pseudo-boolean function, i.e., the LeadingOnes problem, and another problem derived from LeadingOnes, named BVLeadingOnes. Although both problems are unimodal, our analysis shows that LeadingOnes is easy for the UMDA, while BVLeadingOnes is hard for the UMDA. Finally, in order to address the key issue of what problem characteristics make a problem hard for UMDA, we discuss in depth the idea of \"margins\" (or relaxation). We prove theoretically that the UMDA with margins can solve the BVLeadingOnes problem efficiently.",

        "description": "The goal of this research is to deduce important guidelines for designing effective Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs). These guidelines will enhance the designed algorithms in balancing the intensification and diversification effects of EDAs. Most EDAs have the advantage of incorporating probabilistic models which can generate chromosomes with the non-disruption of salient genes. This advantage, however, may cause the problem of the premature convergence of EDAs resulted in the probabilistic models no longer generating diversified solutions. In addition, due to overfitting of the search space, probabilistic models cannot really represent the general information of the population. Therefore, this research will deduce important guidelines through the convergency speed analysis of EDAs under different computational times for designing effective EDA algorithms. The major idea is to increase the population diversity gradually by hybridizing EDAs with other meta-heuristics and replacing the procedures of sampling new solutions. According to that, this research further proposes an Adaptive EA/G to improve the performance of EA/G. The proposed algorithm solves the single machine scheduling problems with earliness/tardiness cost in a just-in-time scheduling environment. The experimental results indicated that the Adaptive EA/G outperforms ACGA and EA/G statistically significant in different stopping criteria. This paper, hence, is of importance in the field of EDAs as well as for the researchers in studying the scheduling problems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "description": "Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) are a set of techniques that belong to the field of Evolutionary Computation. They are similar to Genetic Algorithms (GAs), in the sense that, given a problem, they use a population of individuals to represent solutions, and this population is made to evolve towards the most promising solutions. However, instead of using the usual GA-operators such as mutation or crossover, EDAs learn a probabilistic model that tries to capture the main characteristics of the problem. Based on this idea, several EDAs have been introduced in the last years, showing a good performance and being able to solve problems of different complexity. One important drawback of EDAs is the significant computational effort required by the utilization of probabilistic models, when applied to real-world problems. This fact has led the research community to apply parallel schemes to EDAs, as a viable way to reduce execution times. Schemes already proposed for GAs have been used as the foundation for these parallel schemes. In this chapter, we make a review of parallel EDAs, with a main focus: identifying those parts that are susceptible of parallelization. Then we describe a collection of parallelization strategies proposed in the literature. Additionally, we provide some recommendations for those that are considering the implementation of parallel EDAs on state-of-the-art parallel computers.",

In this context a new class, Shrinkage EDAs, based on shrinkage estimation is presented. Also, a novel mutation operator based on a regularization of the entropy is discussed. Another key contribution of the chapter is the development of a new surrogate fitness model based on the search distributions. With this method the evolution starts in the fitness landscape, switches to the log-probability landscape of the model and then backtracks to continue in the original landscape if the optimum is not found. For the sake of completeness the chapter reviews other techniques for improving the sampling efficiency of EDAs.

GNP uses multiple reusable nodes to construct directed-graph structures to represent its solutions. Recently, many research has clarified that GNP can work well in data mining area. In this paper, a novel evolutionary paradigm named GNP with Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (GNP-EDAs) is proposed and used to solve traffic prediction problems using class association rule mining. In GNP-EDAs, a probabilistic model is constructed by estimating the probability distribution from the selected elite individuals of the previous generation to replace the conventional genetic operators, such as crossover and mutation. The probabilistic model is capable of enhancing the evolution to achieve the ultimate objective. In this paper, two methods are proposed based on extracting the probabilistic information on the node connections and node transitions of GNP-EDAs to construct the probabilistic model. A comparative study of the proposed paradigm and the conventional GNP is made to solve the traffic prediction problems using class association rule mining. The simulation results showed that GNP-EDAs can extract the class association rules more effectively, when the number of the candidate class association rules increases. And the classification accuracy of the proposed method shows good results in traffic prediction systems.",

The emergent modelling is half theoretical - with respect to selection, completely characterized by stochastic calculus and half empirical - concerning the generation of new individuals.

It adopts the distribution of selected individuals in search space and models the probability distributions to generate the next population. However, the primary gap of EDAs is lock of diversity between individuals. Hence, we introduce the IAs that is a new branch in computational intelligence. The main concepts of IAs are suppression and hypermutation that make the individuals be more diversity. Moreover, the primary gap of IAs is to pay no attention to the relation between individuals.

In recent years, a new class of EAs called estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) has emerged based on probabilistic modeling of the search space. Instances of EDAs include population based incremental learning (PBIL) algorithm. The PBIL algorithm is an easy to understand heuristic optimization technique that is inspired by the genetic algorithm and the competitive learning paradigm. PBIL includes many of the features from the genetic algorithm such as binary string representation, the notion of individuals, fitness measures and mutations. Contrary to the genetic algorithm it does not maintain a population of individuals but instead PBIL contains a probability vector. At each generation a new population of individuals is sampled according to the probabilities specified in the probability vector. The population is evaluated and the probability vector is updated by dragging it towards the best individual in the population. In recent years, the investigation of synchronization of chaotic systems has attracted much attention of researchers. Chaos synchronization has been applied in many fields such as secure communication, chemical, engineering, and biological systems, among others. This paper presents the synchronization of two identical discrete chaotic systems subject the different initial conditions by designing a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller.

Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) are a class of evolutionary algorithms which perform a two-step process: building a probabilistic model from which good solutions may be generated and then using this model to generate new individuals. Two distinct research trends that emerged in the past few years are the hybridization of PSO and EDA algorithms and the parallelization of EDAs to exploit the idea of exchanging the probabilistic model information. In this work, we propose the use of a cooperative PSO/EDA algorithm based on the exchange of heterogeneous probabilistic models. The model is heterogeneous because the cooperating PSO/EDA algorithms use different methods to sample the search space. Three different exchange approaches are tested and compared in this work. In all these approaches, the amount of information exchanged is adapted based on the performance of the two cooperating swarms. The performance of the cooperative model is compared to the existing state-of-the-art PSO cooperative approaches using a suite of well-known benchmark optimization functions.",

Empirical studies demonstrate that both GA and EDA are successful in finding good solutions in price optimizing and speed optimizing negotiation, respectively. However, both are not successful in price and speed concurrent optimizing (P-S-Optimizing) negotiation. From these results, finally, this paper suggests a novel method to find best response strategies for P-S-Optimizing negotiation.",

The Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) can get the same or better solutions with less operators and parameters, but the EDAs need more function evaluations than that of the GA.

This paper investigates three commonly used metrics, nonlinearity, simultaneity, and entropy. Then it proposes a new interaction-detection metric which aims at what GAs really need. The proposed metric, namely the differential mutual complement, is based on both the disruption and reproduction effects of the crossover operator on significant schemata. Empirical results show that DSMGA with the proposed metric performs better than the other existing metrics on the aspects of sensitivity to threshold and function evaluation. This new metric is shown to perform well on DSMGA and could be expected to work with other EDAs.",

In particular, we generate landscapes with parameterised, linear ridge structure and perform pairwise comparisons of algorithms to gain insight into what kind of problems are easy and difficult for one algorithm instance relative to another. We apply this methodology to investigate the specific issue of explicit dependency modelling in simple continuous Estimation of Distribution Algorithms. Experimental results reveal specific examples of landscapes (with certain identifiable features) where dependency modelling is useful, harmful or has little impact on average algorithm performance. The results are related to some previous intuition about the behaviour of these algorithms, but at the same time lead to new insights into the relationship between dependency modelling in EDAs and the structure of the problem landscape. The overall methodology is quite general and could be used to examine specific features of other algorithms.",

Estimation of Distribution Algorithms, a special class of Genetic Algorithms, can build complex models of the iterations among variables in the problem, solving several intractable problems in tractable polynomial time. However, the model building process can be computationally expensive and efficiency enhancements are oftentimes necessary to make tractable problems practical. This paper presents a new model building approach, called ClusterMI, inspired both by the Extended Compact Genetic Algorithm and the Dependency Structure Matrix Genetic Algorithm. The new approach has a more efficient model building process, resulting in speed ups of 10 times for moderate size problems and potentially hundreds of times for large problems. Moreover, the new approach may be easily extended to perform incremental evolution, eliminating the burden of representing the population explicitly.",

In order to enhance the features and capabilities of genetic algorithms, tremendous effort has been invested within the research community. One of the major development trends to improve genetic algorithms is trying to extract and exploit the relationship among decision variables, such as estimation of distribution algorithms and perturbation-based methods. In this study, we make an attempt to enable a perturbation-based method, inductive linkage identification (ILI), to detect general problem structures, in which one decision variable can link to an arbitrary number of other variables. Experiments on circular problem structures composed of order-4 and order-5 trap functions are conducted. The results indicate that the proposed technique requires a population size growing logarithmically with the problem size as the original ILI does on non-overlapping building blocks as well as that the population requirement is insensitive to the problem structure consisting of similar substructures as long as the overall problem size is identical.",

Univariate marginal distribution algorithm (UMDA) which is a class algorithm of estimation of distribution algorithms attracts more and more attention in recent years. In this paper a new multi-population and diffusion UMDA (MDUMDA) is proposed for dynamic multimodal problems. The multi-population approach is used to locate multiple local optima which are useful to find the global optimal solution quickly to dynamic multimodal problems. The diffusion model is used to increase the diversity in a guided fashion, which makes the neighbor individuals of previous optimal solutions move gradually from the previous optimal solutions and enlarge the search space. This approach uses both the information of current population and the part history information of the optimal solutions. Finally experimental studies on the moving peaks benchmark are carried out to evaluate the proposed algorithm and compare the performance of MDUMDA and multi-population quantum swarm optimization (MQSO) from the literature. The experimental results show that the MDUMDA is effective for the function with moving optimum and can adapt to the dynamic environments rapidly.",

In this paper, we study the behavior of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) in functions whose structure is defined by using different network topologies which include grids, small-world networks and random graphs. In order to do that, we use several descriptors such as the population size, the number of evaluations as well as the structures learned during the search. Furthermore, we take measures from the field of complex networks such as clustering coefficient or characteristic path length in order to quantify the topological properties of the function structure and analyze their relation with the behavior of EDAs. The results show that these measures are useful to have better understanding of this type of algorithms which have exhibited a high sensitivity to the topological characteristics of the function structure.

        "description": "Recent years have seen an increasing interest in Markov networks as an alternative approach to probabilistic modelling in estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). Distribution Estimation Using Markov network (DEUM) is one of the early EDAs to use this approach. Over the years, several different versions of DEUM have been proposed using different Markov network structures, and are shown to work well in a number of different optimisation problems. One of the key similarities between all of the DEUM algorithms proposed so far is that they all assume the interaction between variables in the problem to be pre-given. In other words, they do not learn the structure of Markov network, and assume that it is known in advance. This work presents a recent development in DEUM framework - a fully multivariate DEUM algorithm that can automatically learn the undirected structure of the problem, automatically find the cliques from the structure and automatically estimate a joint probability model of the Markov network. This model is then sampled using Monte Carlo samplers. The chapter also reviews some of the key works on use of Markov networks in EDAs, and explains the fitness modelling concept used by DEUM. The proposed DEUM algorithm can be applied to any general optimisation problems even when the structure is not known.",

Both spikes and input features in ipESNN are represented as quantum bits being in a superposition of two states (1 and 0) defined by a probability density function. This representation allows for the state of an entire ipESNN at any time to be represented probabilistically in a quantum bit register and probabilistically optimised until convergence using quantum gate operators and a fitness function. The proposed ipESNN is a promising framework for both engineering applications and brain data modeling as it offers faster and more efficient feature selection and model optimization in a large dimensional space in addition to revealing new knowledge that is not possible to obtain using other models. Further development of ipESNN are the neuro-genetic models - ipESNG, that are introduced too, along with open research questions.",

The framework used is the standard Markowitz mean-variance formulation for portfolio optimization with constraints of practical interest, such as minimum and maximum investments per asset and/or on groups of assets. Imposing limits on the number of different assets that can be included in the investment transforms portfolio selection into an NP-complete mixed-integer quadratic optimization problem that is difficult to solve by standard methods. An implementation of the algorithm that employs a genetic algorithm with a set representation, an appropriately defined mutation operator and Random Assortment Recombination for crossover (RAR-GA) is compared with implementations using Simulated Annealing (SA) and various Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs). An empirical investigation of the performance of the portfolios selected with these different methods using financial data shows that RAR-GA and SA are superior to the implementations with EDAs in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. The use of pruning heuristics that effectively reduce the dimensionality of the problem by identifying and eliminating from the universe of investment assets that are not expected to appear in the optimal portfolio leads to significant improvements in performance and makes EDAs competitive with RAR-GA and SA.",

For that reason, in this work we exploit the probabilistic models that EDAs based on Bayesian networks are able to learn in order to provide new information about their behavior. Particularly, we analyze the k solutions with the highest probability in the distributions estimated during the search. In order to study the relationship between the probabilistic model and the fitness function, we focus on calculating, for the k most probable solutions (MPSs), the probability values, the function values and the correlation between both sets of values at each step of the algorithm. Furthermore, the objective functions of the k MPSs are contrasted with the k best individuals in the population. We complete the analysis by calculating the position of the optimum in the k MPSs during the search and the genotypic diversity of these solutions. We carry out the analysis by optimizing functions of different natures such as Trap5, two variants of Ising spin glass and Max-SAT. The results not only show information about the relationship between the probabilistic model and the fitness function, but also allow us to observe characteristics of the search space, the quality of the setup of the parameters and even distinguish between successful and unsuccessful runs.",
