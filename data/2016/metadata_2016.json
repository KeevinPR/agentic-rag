In this paper, an estimation of distribution algorithm with local sampling strategy for community detection in complex networks is presented to optimize the modularity density function. In the proposed algorithm, the evolution probability model is built according to eminent individuals selected by simulated annealing mechanism and a local sampling strategy based on a local similarity model is adopted to improve both the speed and the accuracy for detecting community structure in complex networks. At the same time, a more general version of the criterion function with a tunable parameter. lambda is used to avoid the resolution limit.

        "description": "The extension of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) to the multi-objective domain has led to multi-objective optimization EDAs (MOEDAs). Most MOEDAs have limited themselves to porting single-objective EDAs to the multi-objective domain. Although MOEDAs have proved to be a valid approach, the last point is an obstacle to the achievement of a significant improvement regarding \"standard\" multi-objective optimization evolutionary algorithms. Adapting the model-building algorithm is one way to achieve a substantial advance. Most model-building schemes used so far by EDAs employ off-the-shelf machine learning methods. However, the model-building problem has particular requirements that those methods do not meet and even evade. The focus of this paper is on the model-building issue and how it has not been properly understood and addressed by most MOEDAs. We delve down into the roots of this matter and hypothesize about its causes. To gain a deeper understanding of the subject we propose a novel algorithm intended to overcome the drawbacks of current MOEDAs. This new algorithm is the multi-objective neural estimation of distribution algorithm (MONEDA). MONEDA uses a modified growing neural gas network for model-building (MB-GNG). MB-GNG is a custom-made clustering algorithm that meets the above demands. Thanks to its custom-made model-building algorithm, the preservation of elite individuals and its individual replacement scheme, MONEDA is capable of scalably solving continuous multi-objective optimization problems. It performs better than similar algorithms in terms of a set of quality indicators and computational resource requirements.",

        "description": "Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) constitutes a class of evolutionary algorithms that can extract and exploit knowledge acquired throughout the optimization process. The most critical step in the EDAs is the estimation of the joint probability distribution associated to the variables from the most promising solutions determined by the evaluation function. Recently, a new approach to EDAs has been developed, based on copula theory, to improve the estimation of the joint probability distribution function. However, most copula-based EDAs still present two major drawbacks: focus on copulas with constant parameters, and premature convergence. This paper presents a new copula-based estimation of distribution algorithm for numerical optimization problems, named EDA based on Multivariate Elliptical Copulas (EDA-MEC). This model,uses multivariate copulas to estimate the probability distribution for generating a population of individuals. The EDA-MEC differs from Other copula-based EDAs in several aspects: the copula parameter is dynamically estimated, using dependence measures; it uses a variation of the learned probability distribution to generate individuals that help to avoid premature convergence; and uses a heuristic to reinitialize the population as an additional technique to preserve the diversity of solutions. The paper shows, by means of a set of parametric tests, that this approach improves the overall performance of the optimization process when compared with other copula-based EDAs and with other efficient heuristics such as the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES).

Since the byproduct gas system of steel industry is rather complicated and its data-acquisition process might be frequently affected by the unexpected operational factors, the data-missing phenomenon usually occurs, which might lead to the failure of model establishment or inaccurate information discovery. In this study, a data imputation method based on the manufacturing characteristics is proposed for resolving the data-missing problem in steel industry. A novel correlation analysis, named by non-equal-length granules correlation coefficient (NGCC), is reported, and the corresponding model based on Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) is established to study the correlation of the similar procedures. To verify the performance of the proposed method, this study considers three typical features of the gas flow data with different missing ratios. The experiment results indicate that it is greatly effective for the missing data imputation of byproduct gas, and exhibits better performance on the accuracy compared to the other methods.

        "description": "Population based evolutionary algorithms now form an integral part of fuel management in nuclear reactors and are frequently being used for fuel loading pattern optimization (LPO) problems. In this, paper we have applied Estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) to optimize initial core loading pattern (LP) of AHWR-LEU. In EDA, new solutions are generated by sampling the probability distribution model estimated from the selected best candidate solutions. The weighing factor 'alpha' decides the fraction of current best solution for updating the probability distribution function after each generation. A wider use of EDA warrants a comprehensive study on parameters like population size, weighing factor 'alpha' and initial probability distribution function. In the present study, we have done an extensive analysis on these parameters (population size, weighing factor 'alpha' and initial probability distribution function) in EDA. It is observed that choosing a very small value of 'alpha' may limit the search of optimized solutions in the near vicinity of initial probability distribution function and better loading patterns which are away from initial distribution function may not be considered with due weightage. It is also observed that increasing the population size improves the optimized loading pattern, however the algorithm still fails if the initial distribution function is not close to the expected optimized solution. We have tried to find out the suitable values for 'alpha' and population size to be considered for AHWR-LEU initial core loading pattern optimization problem. For sake of comparison and completeness, we have also addressed the initial core optimization of AHWR-LEU by using Genetic algorithm (GA). In GA too, similar dependence on population size and initial distribution function is observed. However, by increasing the population size, the results in GA optimization improved drastically.

In turning processes, both spindle speed and processing time affect the final energy consumption and thus the spindle speed and scheduling scheme need to be optimized simultaneously. Since the turning workshop can be regarded as the flexible flow shop, this paper formulates a mixed integer nonlinear programming model for the energy-efficient scheduling of the flexible flow shop. Accordingly, a new decoding method is developed for the optimization of both spindle speed and scheduling scheme simultaneously, and an estimation of the distribution algorithm adopting the new decoding method is proposed to solve large-size problems. The parameters of this algorithm are determined by statistics from a simplified practical case. Validation results of the proposed method show that the makespan is shortened to a large extent, and the consumed energy is significantly saved.

        "description": "The main purpose of the vehicle routing problem (VRP) is to deliver a set of customers with known demands on minimum-travel routes and terminating at the same depot. The vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW) requires the delivery made in a specific time window for every customer and returning to the depot before a due time. Contrary to current research, an estimation of distribution-algorithm-based approach coupled with a simulation model is proposed and developed to solve the problem and implement the solution. The approach mentioned makes use of a Bayesian network as a probability model to describe the distribution of the solution space. Furthermore, the approach taken in this study combines the key advantages of both estimation of distribution algorithms (EDA) and simulation. The simulation is used to model the VRPTW environment, while the EDA is used to guide the overall search process to identify the best performing ones. Solomon's (Oper Res 35:254-265, 1987) instances served as input and test parameters in order to show that there exists a relationship and interaction between vertices and positions on the sequence of the VRPTW solution. A better position for each vertex on the sequence can be estimated through a Bayesian network. Experimental results show that the EDA performance was better in 70 % of the cases, as average, for the number of vehicles used in all the trails with respect the other algorithms proposed as a benchmark for comparison with the EDA scheme.",

Such algorithms work well when the EDA's statistical model matches the structure of the domain. Many EDAs use statistical models that represent domain structure with directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). While useful in many areas, DAGs have inherent restrictions that make undirected graph models a viable alternative for many domains. This paper introduces a new EDA, the Markovian Learning Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (MARLEDA), that makes effective use of this idea by employing a Markov random field model. MARLEDA is evaluated on four combinatorial optimization tasks, OneMax, deceptive trap functions, the 2D Rosenbrock function, and 2D Ising spin glasses. MARLEDA is shown to perform better than standard genetic algorithms and a DAG-based EDA. Improving the modeling capabilities of EDAs in this manner brings them closer to effective applications in difficult real-world domains, such as computational biology and autonomous agent design.

        "description": "This paper describes an artificial immune algorithm (IA) combined with estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA), named IA-EDA, for the traveling salesman problem (TSP). Two components are incorporated in IA-EDA to further improve the performance of the conventional IA. First, aiming to strengthen the information exchange during different solutions, two kinds of EDAs involving univariate marginal distribution algorithm and population-based incremental learning are altered based on the permutation representation of TSP. It is expected that new promising candidate solutions can be sampled from the constructed probabilistic model of EDA. Second, a heuristic refinement local search operator is proposed to repair the infeasible solutions sampled by EDA. Therefore, IA-EDA can alleviate the deficiencies of the conventional IA and can find better solutions for TSP by well balancing the exploitation and exploration of the search. Experiments are conducted based on a number of benchmark instances with size up to 100 000 cities. Simulation results show that IA-EDA is effective for improving the performance of the conventional IA and can produce better or competitive solutions than other hybrid algorithms.

In the literature, various formulations of the ASS problems have been established by taking different scheduling requirements into account, and various methods have been developed to cope with these ASS problems. However, it is usually uneasy to generalize a method designed for one ASS formulation to another, while an approach that is able to handle different ASS problems is of great significance since air traffic controllers may need to switch among different scheduling requirements in practice. Motivated by this observation, an approach that is applicable to a number of different problem formulations of ASS is proposed in this paper. Specifically, the ASS problems that include different objective functions and constraints are firstly abstracted as a constrained permutation-based problem. After that, a Sequence Searching and Evaluation (SSE) approach is developed for the constrained permutation-based problem. The SSE solves different ASS problems by separating the sequence searching in one stage using an Estimation of Distribution Algorithm framework, and evaluating sequences in the second stage. Experiment results show that SSE is capable of obtaining competitive solutions for a variety of ASS problems.",

Particle swarm optimization (PSO) has been shown to be a fast converging algorithm for WDN optimization. An improved estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) using historic best positions to construct a sample space is hybridized with PSO both in sequential and in parallel to improve population diversity control and avoid premature convergence. Two water distribution network benchmark examples from the literature are adopted to evaluate the performance of the proposed hybrid algorithms. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithms achieved the literature record minimum (6.081 M$) for the small size Hanoi network. For the large size Balerma network, the parallel hybrid achieved a slightly lower minimum (1.921Ma,not sign) than the current literature reported best minimum (1.923Ma,not sign). The average number of evaluations needed to achieve the minimum is one order smaller than most existing algorithms. With a fixed, small number of evaluations, the sequential hybrid outperforms the parallel hybrid showing its capability for fast convergence. The fitness and diversity of the populations were tracked for the proposed algorithms. The track record suggests that constructing an EDA sample space with historic best positions can improve diversity control significantly. Parallel hybridization also helps to improve diversity control yet its effect is relatively less significant.",

Most existing methodologies have demonstrated success for problems with two and three objectives but face significant challenges in many-objective optimization.

The project of C-Multi is based on two phases; the first uses a unique particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to discover different regions of the Pareto front. The second phase uses multiple swarms to specialize on a dedicate part. On each sub swarm, an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) is used to focus on convergence to its allocated region. In this study, the influence of two critical components of C-Multi, the archiving method and the number of swarms, is investigated by empirical analysis. As a result of this investigation, an improved variant of C-Multi is obtained, and its performance is compared to I-Multi, a multi-swarm algorithm that has a similar approach but does not use EDAs.

We define and estimate the bias due to recursion in grammar-based EDAs in GP, using methods derived from computational linguistics. We confirm the extent of bias in some simple experimental examples. We then propose some methods to repair this bias. We apply the estimation of bias, and its repair, to some more practical applications. We experimentally demonstrate the extent of bias arising from recursion, and the performance improvements that can result from correcting it.",

The objective of this problem is to find a robust optimal solution for a finite set of possible scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel robust optimization approach, called an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) with stochastic local search (SLS), to tackle this problem. The proposed method integrates an EDA with a novel two phase SLS procedure to minimize the maximal total cost over a set of different scenarios. The SLS procedure avoids excessive fitness evaluations of unpromising moves in local search. Our experimental results on two sets of benchmark problems (a total of 55 problem instances) showed that the proposed approach outperformed existing state-of-the-art algorithms.",

The essence of path planning of the aircraft is a multiobjective optimization problem. To deal with this problem efficiently, this paper proposes an adaptive multiobjective estimation of distribution algorithm named as AMEDA. In AMEDA, a novel clustering-based multivariate Gaussian sampling strategy is designed. At each generation, a clustering analysis approach is utilized to discover the distribution structure of the population. Based on the distribution information, with a certain probability, a local or a global multivariate Gaussian model (MGM) is built for each solution to sample a new solution. A covariance sharing strategy is designed in AMEDA to reduce the complexity of building MGMs, and an adaptive update strategy of the probability that controls the contributions of the two types of MGMs is developed to dynamically balance exploration and exploitation. Experiments show that AMEDA is efficient to deal with the path planning model of the aircraft. Meanwhile, it is convenient to provide multiple flight paths with different characteristics for the decision makers.",

        "description": "In a video surveillance system with a single static camera, tracking results of moving persons can be effectively used for camera self-calibration. However, the current methods need to depend on robustness of both tracking and segmentation procedures. RANSAC has been widely used to remove outliers in finding the vertical vanishing point and the horizon line, but the performance is degraded when the proportion of outliers is high. Last but not least, all of them require excessive simplifications in the algorithmic procedures resulting in increasing reprojection error. In this paper, a robust segmentation and tracking system is applied to provide accurate estimation of head and foot locations of moving persons. The noise in the computation of vanishing points is handled by mean shift clustering and Laplace linear regression through convex optimization. We also propose to use the estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) to search for the local optimal solution for camera calibration that minimizes average reprojection error on the ground plane, while relaxing the assumptions on camera parameters.

Optimization problems with many hundreds or thousands of variables are called large-scale global optimization (LSGO) problems. Many well-known real-world LSGO problems are not separable and are complex for detailed analysis, thus they are viewed as the black-box optimization problems. The most advanced algorithms for LSGO are based on cooperative coevolution schemes using the problem decomposition. These algorithms are mainly proposed for the real-valued search space and cannot be applied for problems with discrete or mixed variables. In this paper a novel technique is proposed, that uses a binary genetic algorithm as the core technique. The estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) is used for collecting statistical data based on the past search experience to provide the problem decomposition by fixing genes in chromosomes. Such an EDA-based decomposition technique has the benefits of the random grouping methods and the dynamic learning methods. The EDA-based decomposition GA using the island model is also discussed. The results of numerical experiments for benchmark problems from the CEC competition are presented and discussed. The experiments show that the approach demonstrates efficiency comparable to other advanced techniques.",

By using this model, there will be a selection based on the area instead of selection based on the individual, and all individual information could use to produce new solution. In the proposed algorithm, considering the simultaneous use of global information about search area, local information of the solutions and the Voronoi based probability model lead to produce more diverse solutions and prevent sticking in local optima.

Under this extension, the problem contains two stages. At the first assignment stage, a set N of n jobs is distributed among F factories with flowline eligibility constraint, i.e., not all the factories are available for every job. Then each factory can be regarded as a regular permutation flow shop scheduling problem (PFSP) in which jobs assigned to each factory have to be processed on m machines according to the given permutation. The objective is to minimize the maximum completion time or makespan of all the factories. The flowline eligibility constraint adds asymmetry and complexity to the regular DPFSP. In the proposed hybrid estimation of distribution algorithm (hybrid EDA), a heuristic of Framinan and Leisten (FLH) based solution-generate method (FLHSGM), two novel factory-based operators are proposed, and an effective local search based on variable neighborhood search (VNS) is employed and incorporated into EDA. Numerical simulations with comprehensive computational and statistical analysis are carried out. The experimental results and comparisons with existing algorithms show that the FLHSGM and the VNS-based local search enhances the search ability of EDA and the effectiveness of the hybrid EDA in solving both small-scale and large-scale DPFSP with flowline eligibility.",

In this paper we devise an Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) for continuous optimisation that exploits intrinsic dimension without knowing the influential subspace of the input space, or its dimension, by employing the idea of random embedding. While the idea is applicable to any optimiser, EDA is known to be remarkably successful in low dimensional problems but prone to the curse of dimensionality in larger problems because its model building step requires large population sizes. Our method, Random Embedding in Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (REMEDA) remedies this weakness and is able to optimise very large dimensional problems as long as their intrinsic dimension is low.",

        "description": "The challenges of solving problems naturally represented as permutations by Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) have been a recent focus of interest in the evolutionary computation community. One of the most common alternative representations for permutation based problems is the Random Key (RK), which enables the use of continuous approaches for this problem domain. However, the use of RK in EDAs have not produced competitive results to date and more recent research on permutation based EDAs have focused on creating superior algorithms with specially adapted representations. In this paper, we present RK-EDA; a novel RK based EDA that uses a cooling scheme to balance the exploration and exploitation of a search space by controlling the variance in its probabilistic model. Unlike the general performance of RK based EDAs, RK-EDA is actually competitive with the best EDAs on common permutation test problems: Flow Shop Scheduling, Linear Ordering, Quadratic Assignment, and Travelling Salesman Problems.",

Firstly, a speed-up evaluation method is developed according to the property of NFSSP with SDSTs and RDs. Secondly, the genetic information both order of jobs and the promising blocks of jobs are concerned to generate the guided probabilistic model. Thirdly, after the HEDA based global exploration, a problem dependent local search is developed to emphasize exploitation. Due to the reasonable balance between HEDA based global search and problem-dependent local search as well as the comprehensive utilization of the speed-up evaluation, TCT-NFSSP with SDSTs and RDs can be solved effectively and efficiently. Computational results and comparisons demonstrate the superiority of HEDA in terms of searching quality, robustness, and efficiency.",

        "description": "With the current level of pollution in atmosphere caused by fossil fuel emissions, coupled with the ominous fuel scarcity, efficient generation at the power stations is necessary. This paper proposes a multi-objective optimization model to maximize social welfare using the Bees Foraging Algorithm (BFA) and Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) highlighting the importance of treating generator efficiency parameters along with generation bid. This is because the generator bids alone are a poor representation of efficiency, being influenced by economic attitudes. Along with Economic Load Dispatch (ELD), the model reduces fossil fuel emissions and increases the efficiency of operating generators through curtailment to shift the operating point of generators to a more efficient region, while maintaining constraints of the system. The generation side curtailment is reflected on distribution side, where curtailment schemes based on the willingness to pay of the consumer and priority based incentive is used, thereby performing environmental dispatch. The improved efficiency reduces fuel consumption per MW thereby reducing fuel cost (Rs/h) and emission (ton/h), therefore maintaining generation efficiency with profit retention. The paper therefore establish that Independent System Operator (ISO), by real-time control of incentives and curtailment, encourage efficient consumption pattern among consumers and production among generating companies (GENCO). The results confirm that the proposed model benefits the society i.e. consumers, power producers and the environment.",

Optimization problems with many hundreds or thousands of variables are called large-scale global optimization (LGSO) problems. The most advanced algorithms for LSGO are proposed for continuous problems and are based on cooperative coevolution schemes using the problem decomposition. In this paper a novel technique is proposed. A genetic algorithm is used as the core technique. The estimation of distribution algorithm is used for collecting statistical data based on the past search experience to provide the problem decomposition by fixing genes in chromosomes. Such an EDA-based decomposition technique has the benefits of the random grouping methods and the dynamic learning methods. The results of numerical experiments for benchmark problems from the CEC' 13 competition are presented. The experiments show that the approach demonstrates efficiency comparable to other advanced algorithms.",

        "description": "In this paper we propose a new Copula-based Estimation of Distribution Algorithm, to solve Many-objective optimization problem and to get new optimal solutions in very court time. Our algorithm uses the proprieties of Copula and exploits their statistical properties to make new solutions using the founded optimal solutions through the estimation of their distribution. The first step of the proposed Copula-based Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (CEDA-SVM) is taking initial solutions offered by any MOEA (Multi Objective Evolutionary Algorithm), and then creates Copulas to estimate their distribution, and we use Support Vector Machine (SVM) to learn the Pareto solutions model; those Copulas will be used to generate new solutions and SVM to avoid the expensive function evaluations. The idea of using the estimated distribution of the optimal solutions helps CEDA-SVM to avoid running the optimizer (MOEA) every time we need new alternatives solutions when the founded ones are not satisfactory. We tested CEDA-SVM on a set of many-objective benchmark problems traditionally used by the community, namely DTLZ (1, 2, 3, and 4) with different dimensions (3, 5, 8, 10, and 15). We used CEDA along with MOEA/D-Schy and MOEA/D-BI as two examples of MOEA thus resulting in two variants CEDA-MOAE/D-Sey and CEDA-MOEA/D-BI and compare them with MOEA/D-Schy and MOEA/D-BI. The results of our experiments show that, with both variants of CEDA-SVM, new solutions can be obtained in a very small time compared to the other algorithms.

As a test problem, we consider permutation flowshop scheduling, minimizing the total flow time an 120 different problem :instances (Taillard benchmark). The performance of GOMEA is compared with the recently published generalized Mallows estimation of distribution algorithm (GM-EDA). Statistical tests show that results of GOMEA variants are almost always significantly better than results of GM-EDA. Moreover, even without using local search, the new GOMEA variants obtained the best-known solution for 30 instances in every run and even new upper bounds for several instances. Finally, the time complexity per solution for building a dependency model to drive variation is an order of complexity less for GOMEA than for GM-FDA, al together suggesting that GOMEA also holds much promise for permutation optimization.",

And also, its high error matching ratio caused by the large number of iterations always raises the possibility of false registration. To deal with these drawbacks, a novel multi-objective optimization-based image registration method is proposed, named MO-IRM. In MO-IRM, a multi-objective estimation model is built to describe the feature matching pairs (data set), with no need for the pre-check process that is necessary in some improved RANSAC algorithms to eliminate the error-matching pairs. Moreover, a full variate Gaussian model-based RM-MEDA without clustering process (FRM-MEDA) is presented to solve the established multi-objective model. FRM-MEDA only requires a few iterations to find out a correct model. FRM-MEDA can not only greatly reduce the computational overhead but also effectively decrease the possibility of false registration. The proposed MO-IRM is compared with RM-MEDA, NSGA-square and the RANSAC based registration algorithm on the Dazu grottoes image database. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves ideal registration performances on both two images and multiple images, and greatly outperforms the compared algorithms on the runtime.",

Traditional EAs may perform better but are slow to optimize if a problem is sufficiently noisy that most large solutions are equally ineffective and it is only when much smaller solutions are discovered that effective optimization may begin. By using targeting, TEDA is able to drive down the feature set size quickly and so speeds up this process.

The good performance of the proposed new paradigm was demonstrated over different configurations and datasets. First, several CSS stacking classifiers were constructed on the RekEmozio dataset, using some specific standard base classifiers and a total of 123 spectral, quality and prosodic features computed using in-house feature extraction algorithms. These initial CSS stacking classifiers were compared to other multi-classifier systems and the employed standard classifiers built on the same set of speech features. Then, new CSS stacking classifiers were built on RekEmozio using a different set of both acoustic parameters (extended version of the Geneva Minimalistic Acoustic Parameter Set (eGeMAPS)) and standard classifiers and employing the best meta-classifier of the initial experiments. The performance of these two CSS stacking classifiers was evaluated and compared. Finally, the new paradigm was tested on the well-known Berlin Emotional Speech database. We compared the performance of single, standard stacking and CSS stacking systems using the same parametrization of the second phase.

We pay special attention to the problem of PA-SSI, which is universally significant in collaborative product development (CPD). The objective of PA-SSI is to develop an optimized model to exchange a singular sketch (spline) to ensure that the exchanged model both maintains high geometric fidelity and can be effectively edited in the target CAD system. The proposed method applies the estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) to automatically solve this problem, and a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is built according to the promising solutions. Furthermore, Hausdorff distance is adopted to calculate the fitness, and a local optimization operator is designed to enhance the global search capability of the population. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can maintain a sufficiently high geometric fidelity, and ensure that the exchanged model of the target CAD system can be parametrically edited.",

        "description": "In this paper, an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA)-based memetic algorithm (MA) is proposed for solving the distributed assembly permutation flow-shop scheduling problem (DAPFSP) with the objective to minimize the maximum completion time. A novel bi-vector-based method is proposed to represent a solution for the DAPFSP. In the searching phase of the EDA-based MA (EDAMA), the EDA-based exploration and the local-search-based exploitation are incorporated within the MA framework. For the EDA-based exploration phase, a probability model is built to describe the probability distribution of superior solutions. Besides, a novel selective-enhancing sampling mechanism is proposed for generating new solutions by sampling the probability model. For the local-search-based exploitation phase, the critical path of the DAPFSP is analyzed to avoid invalid searching operators. Based on the analysis, a critical-path-based local search strategy is proposed to further improve the potential solutions obtained in the EDA-based searching phase. Moreover, the effect of parameter setting is investigated based on the Taguchi method of design-of-experiment. Suitable parameter values are suggested for instances with different scales. Finally, numerical simulations based on 1710 benchmark instances are carried out. The experimental results and comparisons with existing algorithms show the effectiveness of the EDAMA in solving the DAPFSP. In addition, the best-known solutions of 181 instances are updated by the EDAMA.",

        "description": "Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) were proposed as an alternative for traditional evolutionary algorithms in which reproduction operators could rely on information extracted from the population to enable a more effective search. Since information is usually represented as a probabilistic graphic model, the effectiveness of EDAs strongly depends on how accurately such models represent the population. In this sense, models of increasing complexity have been employed by EDAs, with the most successful ones being able to encode multivariate factorizations of joint probability distributions. However, some studies have shown that even multivariate EDAs fail to build accurate models for problems in which there is an intrinsic pairwise independence between variables. This study elucidates how pairwise independence impacts the linkage learning procedures of multivariate EDAs and affects their accuracy. First, the necessary conditions for learning additively separable functions are assessed, from which it is shown that extreme multimodality can induce pairwise independence. Second, it is demonstrated that in the presence of pairwise independence the approximate linkage learning procedures employed by many EDAs are not able to retrieve high-order dependences. Finally, in an attempt to infer how likely pairwise independence occur in practical problems, the case of non-separable functions is empirically investigated. For this purpose, the NK-model and the Linkage-Tree Genetic Algorithm (LTGA) were used as a study case and a range of usefulness for the LTGA was estimated according to N (problem size) and K (degree of interactions among variables and multimodality). The results indicated that LTGA linkage learning is probably more useful for K <= 6 on instances with random linkages (this range grows with N), and for K <= 9 on instances with nearest-neighbor linkages (this range is stable with N). Outside these ranges, pairwise independence is more likely to occur, which deteriorates models accuracy and impairs LTGA performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

Most data clustering algorithms require the user to set a number of pre-defined parameters that have decisive impact in the formation of clusters, such as the number of clusters (initial or final), cluster radius, minimum number of objects, and similar parameters. In addition, several clustering algorithms are limited with regard to the shape of clusters that can be found, a limitation usually resulting from the optimisation process performed over a given distance metric. In this work, we propose a novel clustering algorithm that addresses the two aforementioned problems regarding the amount of parameters and cluster shape. Our approach makes use of the theory of Estimation of Distribution Algorithms in order to probabilistic sample a set of must-link/cannot link constraints in order to generate a data partition with the proper number of clusters. We name our method PASCAL, and we empirically show that it is capable of not only detecting the right number of clusters but also of properly assigning objects to the correct cluster in a variety of artificial and real problems whose solutions are known in advance.",

        "description": "Estimation of distribution algorithms are considered to be a new class of evolutionary algorithms which are applied as an alternative to genetic algorithms. Such algorithms sample the new generation from a probabilistic model of promising solutions. The search space of the optimization problem is improved by such probabilistic models. In the Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA), the set of promising solutions forms a Bayesian network and the new solutions are sampled from the built Bayesian network. This paper proposes a novel real-coded stochastic BOA for continuous global optimization by utilizing a stochastic Bayesian network. In the proposed algorithm, the new Bayesian network takes advantage of using a stochastic structure (that there is a probability distribution function for each edge in the network) and the new generation is sampled from the stochastic structure. In order to generate a new solution, some new structure, and therefore a new Bayesian network is sampled from the current stochastic structure and the new solution will be produced from the sampled Bayesian network. Due to the stochastic structure used in the sampling phase, each sample can be generated based on a different structure. Therefore the different dependency structures can be preserved. Before the new generation is generated, the stochastic network's probability distributions are updated according to the fitness evaluation of the current generation. The proposed method is able to take advantage of using different dependency structures through the sampling phase just by using one stochastic structure. The experimental results reported in this paper show that the proposed algorithm increases the quality of the solutions on the general optimization benchmark problems.",

They are able to take advantage of correlation structure to drive the search more efficiently, and they are able to provide insights about the structure of the search space. However, model building in high dimensions is extremely challenging, and as a result existing EDAs may become less attractive in large-scale problems because of the associated large computational requirements. Large-scale continuous global optimisation is key to many modern-day real-world problems. Scaling up EAs to large-scale problems has become one of the biggest challenges of the field. This paper pins down some fundamental roots of the problem and makes a start at developing a new and generic framework to yield effective and efficient EDA-type algorithms for large-scale continuous global optimisation problems. Our concept is to introduce an ensemble of random projections to low dimensions of the set of fittest search points as a basis for developing a new and generic divide-and-conquer methodology. Our ideas are rooted in the theory of random projections developed in theoretical computer science, and in developing and analysing our framework we exploit some recent results in nonasymptotic random matrix theory.",

While a large update strength is desirable for exploitation, there is a general trade-off : too strong updates can lead to genetic drift and poor performance. We demonstrate this trade-off for the cGA and a simple MMAS ACO algorithm on the OneMax function. More precisely, we obtain lower bounds on the expected runtime of Omega(K root n + n log n) and Omega(root n/rho + n log n), respectively, showing that the update strength should be limited to 1/K, rho = O (1/(root n log n)). In fact, choosing 1/K, rho similar to 1/(root n log n) both algorithms efficiently optimize OneMax in expected time O (n log n). Our analyses provide new insights into the stochastic behavior of probabilistic model-building GAs and propose new guidelines for setting the update strength in global optimization.",

Some authors have suggested that employing a heavy tailed search distribution, such as a Cauchy, may make EDA better explore a high dimensional search space. However, other authors have found Cauchy search distributions are less effective than Gaussian search distributions in high dimensional problems. In this paper, we set out to resolve this controversy. To achieve this we run extensive experiments on a battery of high-dimensional test functions, and develop some theory which shows that small search steps are always more likely to move the search distribution towards the global optimum than large ones and, in particular, large search steps in high-dimensional spaces do badly in this respect with high probability. We hypothesise that, since exploration by large steps is mostly counterproductive in high dimensions, and since the fraction of good directions decays exponentially fast with increasing dimension, instead one should focus mainly on finding the right direction in which to move the search distribution. We propose a minor change to standard Gaussian EDA which implicitly achieves this aim, and our experiments on a sequence of test functions confirm the good performance of our new approach.",

Among methods that try to scale up EDA to high dimensional problems, EDA-MCC was recently proposed. It controls the complexity of the search distribution by thresholding correlation estimates as a means to approximate the prominent dependency structure among the search variables and discard irrelevant detail.|However, it is known that the correlation coefficient can only determine statistical dependence when the data distribution is Gaussian. In this paper, we develop a new variant of EDA-MCC called EDA-MCC-MI which uses mutual information (MI) estimates to determine dependencies between the search variables, replacing linear correlation. Our method is in a better position to determine the correct dependency structure than the EDA-MCC can do, simply because MI is zero if and only if the variables are independent, whereas a zero correlation does not imply independence in general. Empirical comparison results show that EDA-MCC-MI is never worse than EDA-MCC even when the search distribution is Gaussian. Our implementation employs a nonparametric MI estimator, hence it is easily extensible to any other, non-Gaussian search distribution.",

We study the proposed method in different test suites and compare its performance with some other well-known optimization methods. The comparative study demonstrates the good figures of merit of the MOCE+ method in complex test suites. Finally, the proposed method is applied to the multi-objective optimization of a micro-drilling process. Two conflicting targets are considered: total drilling time and vibrations on the plane that is perpendicular to the drilling axis. The Pareto front, obtained through the optimization process, is analyzed through quality metrics and the available options in the decision-making process. Overall, the quality metrics of the MOCE+ method were better than the metrics of the other optimization methods considered in this work.

Thus, they do not allow for a straightforward application of traditional optimization techniques. In these settings, randomized search heuristics such as evolutionary algorithms are a popular choice because they are often assumed to exhibit some kind of resistance to noise. Empirical evidence suggests that some algorithms, such as estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) are robust against a scaling of the noise intensity, even without resorting to explicit noise-handling techniques such as resampling.|In this paper, we want to support such claims with mathematical rigor. We introduce the concept of graceful scaling in which the run time of an algorithm scales polynomially with noise intensity. We study a monotone fitness function over binary strings with additive noise taken from a Gaussian distribution. We show that myopic heuristics cannot efficiently optimize the function under arbitrarily intense noise without any explicit noise-handling. Furthermore, we prove that using a population does not help. Finally we show that a simple EDA called the Compact Genetic Algorithm can overcome the shortsightedness of mutation-only heuristics to scale gracefully with noise. We conjecture that recombinative genetic algorithms also have this property.|This extended abstract summarizes our work \"The Benefit of Recombination in Noisy Evolutionary Search,\" which appeared in Proceedings of International Symposium on Algorithms and Computation (ISAAC), 2015, pp.140-150.",

        "description": "Decomposition to smaller sub-problems is a general approach in problem solving. Many of the real-world problems can be decomposed into a number of sub-problems which may be solved easier. Appropriate decomposition is a significant issue specially for optimization problems where the optimal solution is usually obtained by combining the solutions of sub-problems. Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) are a type of evolutionary algorithms that learn a model of problem from the population of candidate solutions.|This model is intended to capture the interactions between problem variables, thus facilitating problem decomposition and is used to generate new solutions. In this paper, a novel type of problems is presented that is designed to challenge the model building process in discrete EDAs. The main idea is to propose a set of problems that their candidate solutions can be simultaneously decomposed into different sub-problems. This means that the candidate solution of a problem may be interpreted by two or more different structure where only one is true, resulting in the optimal solution to that problem. Some of these decompositions or structures may be more likely according to the low-order statistics collected from the population of candidate solutions, but may not necessarily lead to the optimal solution. Learning the correct structure/decomposition is a challenge for the model building process in EDA. The experimental results show that the proposed problems are indeed difficult for EDAs even when expressive models such as Bayesian networks are used to capture the interactions in the problem.",

        "description": "Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) were proposed as an alternative for traditional evolutionary algorithms in which reproduction operators could rely on information extracted from the population to enable a more effective search. Since information is usually represented as a probabilistic graphic model, the effectiveness of EDAs strongly depends on how accurately such models represent the population. In this sense, models of increasing complexity have been employed by EDAs, with the most successful ones being able to encode multivariate factorizations of joint probability distributions. However, some studies have shown that even multivariate EDAs fail to build accurate models for problems in which there is an intrinsic pairwise independence between variables. This study elucidates how pairwise independence impacts the linkage learning procedures of multivariate EDAs and affects their accuracy. First, the necessary conditions for learning additively separable functions are assessed, from which it is shown that extreme multimodality can induce pairwise independence. Second, it is demonstrated that in the presence of pairwise independence the approximate linkage learning procedures employed by many EDAs are not able to retrieve high-order dependences. Finally, in an attempt to infer how likely pairwise independence occur in practical problems, the case of non-separable functions is empirically investigated. For this purpose, the NK-model and the Linkage-Tree Genetic Algorithm (LTGA) were used as a study case and a range of usefulness for the LTGA was estimated according to N (problem size) and K (degree of interactions among variables and multimodality). The results indicated that LTGA linkage learning is probably more useful for K <= 6 on instances with random linkages (this range grows with N), and for K <= 9 on instances with nearest-neighbor linkages (this range is stable with N). Outside these ranges, pairwise independence is more likely to occur, which deteriorates models accuracy and impairs LTGA performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

Most data clustering algorithms require the user to set a number of pre-defined parameters that have decisive impact in the formation of clusters, such as the number of clusters (initial or final), cluster radius, minimum number of objects, and similar parameters. In addition, several clustering algorithms are limited with regard to the shape of clusters that can be found, a limitation usually resulting from the optimisation process performed over a given distance metric. In this work, we propose a novel clustering algorithm that addresses the two aforementioned problems regarding the amount of parameters and cluster shape. Our approach makes use of the theory of Estimation of Distribution Algorithms in order to probabilistic sample a set of must-link/cannot link constraints in order to generate a data partition with the proper number of clusters. We name our method PASCAL, and we empirically show that it is capable of not only detecting the right number of clusters but also of properly assigning objects to the correct cluster in a variety of artificial and real problems whose solutions are known in advance.",

        "description": "Estimation of distribution algorithms are considered to be a new class of evolutionary algorithms which are applied as an alternative to genetic algorithms. Such algorithms sample the new generation from a probabilistic model of promising solutions. The search space of the optimization problem is improved by such probabilistic models. In the Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA), the set of promising solutions forms a Bayesian network and the new solutions are sampled from the built Bayesian network. This paper proposes a novel real-coded stochastic BOA for continuous global optimization by utilizing a stochastic Bayesian network. In the proposed algorithm, the new Bayesian network takes advantage of using a stochastic structure (that there is a probability distribution function for each edge in the network) and the new generation is sampled from the stochastic structure. In order to generate a new solution, some new structure, and therefore a new Bayesian network is sampled from the current stochastic structure and the new solution will be produced from the sampled Bayesian network. Due to the stochastic structure used in the sampling phase, each sample can be generated based on a different structure. Therefore the different dependency structures can be preserved. Before the new generation is generated, the stochastic network's probability distributions are updated according to the fitness evaluation of the current generation. The proposed method is able to take advantage of using different dependency structures through the sampling phase just by using one stochastic structure. The experimental results reported in this paper show that the proposed algorithm increases the quality of the solutions on the general optimization benchmark problems.",

They are able to take advantage of correlation structure to drive the search more efficiently, and they are able to provide insights about the structure of the search space. However, model building in high dimensions is extremely challenging, and as a result existing EDAs may become less attractive in large-scale problems because of the associated large computational requirements. Large-scale continuous global optimisation is key to many modern-day real-world problems. Scaling up EAs to large-scale problems has become one of the biggest challenges of the field. This paper pins down some fundamental roots of the problem and makes a start at developing a new and generic framework to yield effective and efficient EDA-type algorithms for large-scale continuous global optimisation problems. Our concept is to introduce an ensemble of random projections to low dimensions of the set of fittest search points as a basis for developing a new and generic divide-and-conquer methodology. Our ideas are rooted in the theory of random projections developed in theoretical computer science, and in developing and analysing our framework we exploit some recent results in nonasymptotic random matrix theory.",

While a large update strength is desirable for exploitation, there is a general trade-off : too strong updates can lead to genetic drift and poor performance. We demonstrate this trade-off for the cGA and a simple MMAS ACO algorithm on the OneMax function. More precisely, we obtain lower bounds on the expected runtime of Omega(K root n + n log n) and Omega(root n/rho + n log n), respectively, showing that the update strength should be limited to 1/K, rho = O (1/(root n log n)). In fact, choosing 1/K, rho similar to 1/(root n log n) both algorithms efficiently optimize OneMax in expected time O (n log n). Our analyses provide new insights into the stochastic behavior of probabilistic model-building GAs and propose new guidelines for setting the update strength in global optimization.",

In order to do so, we conduct experiments with Estimation of distribution algorithms as well as the fitness landscape analysis and the deception analysis. Our results indicate that the first difficulties arise from the inappropriate fitness function and representation of solutions coupled with a huge search space. The fitness landscape analysis does not reveal any significant differences that could justify the assumed jump in problem difficulty when going from Boolean functions with 6 inputs to those with 8 inputs.

Some authors have suggested that employing a heavy tailed search distribution, such as a Cauchy, may make EDA better explore a high dimensional search space. However, other authors have found Cauchy search distributions are less effective than Gaussian search distributions in high dimensional problems. In this paper, we set out to resolve this controversy. To achieve this we run extensive experiments on a battery of high-dimensional test functions, and develop some theory which shows that small search steps are always more likely to move the search distribution towards the global optimum than large ones and, in particular, large search steps in high-dimensional spaces do badly in this respect with high probability. We hypothesise that, since exploration by large steps is mostly counterproductive in high dimensions, and since the fraction of good directions decays exponentially fast with increasing dimension, instead one should focus mainly on finding the right direction in which to move the search distribution. We propose a minor change to standard Gaussian EDA which implicitly achieves this aim, and our experiments on a sequence of test functions confirm the good performance of our new approach.",

It controls the complexity of the search distribution by thresholding correlation estimates as a means to approximate the prominent dependency structure among the search variables and discard irrelevant detail.|However, it is known that the correlation coefficient can only determine statistical dependence when the data distribution is Gaussian. In this paper, we develop a new variant of EDA-MCC called EDA-MCC-MI which uses mutual information (MI) estimates to determine dependencies between the search variables, replacing linear correlation. Our method is in a better position to determine the correct dependency structure than the EDA-MCC can do, simply because MI is zero if and only if the variables are independent, whereas a zero correlation does not imply independence in general. Empirical comparison results show that EDA-MCC-MI is never worse than EDA-MCC even when the search distribution is Gaussian. Our implementation employs a nonparametric MI estimator, hence it is easily extensible to any other, non-Gaussian search distribution.",

The Pareto front, obtained through the optimization process, is analyzed through quality metrics and the available options in the decision-making process. Overall, the quality metrics of the MOCE+ method were better than the metrics of the other optimization methods considered in this work.

In this paper we review recent work on EDAs that apply MPAs and propose ways to further extend the useful synergies between MPAs and EDAs. Furthermore, we analyze some of the implications that MPA developments can have in their future application to EDAs and other evolutionary algorithms.",

        "description": "Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) were proposed as an alternative for traditional evolutionary algorithms in which reproduction operators could rely on information extracted from the population to enable a more effective search. Since information is usually represented as a probabilistic graphic model, the effectiveness of EDAs strongly depends on how accurately such models represent the population. In this sense, models of increasing complexity have been employed by EDAs, with the most successful ones being able to encode multivariate factorizations of joint probability distributions. However, some studies have shown that even multivariate EDAs fail to build accurate models for problems in which there is an intrinsic pairwise independence between variables. This study elucidates how pairwise independence impacts the linkage learning procedures of multivariate EDAs and affects their accuracy. First, the necessary conditions for learning additively separable functions are assessed, from which it is shown that extreme multimodality can induce pairwise independence. Second, it is demonstrated that in the presence of pairwise independence the approximate linkage learning procedures employed by many EDAs are not able to retrieve high-order dependences. Finally, in an attempt to infer how likely pairwise independence occur in practical problems, the case of non-separable functions is empirically investigated. For this purpose, the NK-model and the Linkage-Tree Genetic Algorithm (LTGA) were used as a study case and a range of usefulness for the LTGA was estimated according to N (problem size) and K (degree of interactions among variables and multimodality). The results indicated that LTGA linkage learning is probably more useful for K <= 6 on instances with random linkages (this range grows with N), and for K <= 9 on instances with nearest-neighbor linkages (this range is stable with N). Outside these ranges, pairwise independence is more likely to occur, which deteriorates models accuracy and impairs LTGA performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "description": "Data clustering is an unsupervised learning task that can be regarded as the combinatorial optimisation NP-hard problem of assigning N objects to one (or more) among k clusters. Most data clustering algorithms require the user to set a number of pre-defined parameters that have decisive impact in the formation of clusters, such as the number of clusters (initial or final), cluster radius, minimum number of objects, and similar parameters. In addition, several clustering algorithms are limited with regard to the shape of clusters that can be found, a limitation usually resulting from the optimisation process performed over a given distance metric. In this work, we propose a novel clustering algorithm that addresses the two aforementioned problems regarding the amount of parameters and cluster shape. Our approach makes use of the theory of Estimation of Distribution Algorithms in order to probabilistic sample a set of must-link/cannot link constraints in order to generate a data partition with the proper number of clusters. We name our method PASCAL, and we empirically show that it is capable of not only detecting the right number of clusters but also of properly assigning objects to the correct cluster in a variety of artificial and real problems whose solutions are known in advance.",

        "description": "Estimation of distribution algorithms are considered to be a new class of evolutionary algorithms which are applied as an alternative to genetic algorithms. Such algorithms sample the new generation from a probabilistic model of promising solutions. The search space of the optimization problem is improved by such probabilistic models. In the Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA), the set of promising solutions forms a Bayesian network and the new solutions are sampled from the built Bayesian network. This paper proposes a novel real-coded stochastic BOA for continuous global optimization by utilizing a stochastic Bayesian network. In the proposed algorithm, the new Bayesian network takes advantage of using a stochastic structure (that there is a probability distribution function for each edge in the network) and the new generation is sampled from the stochastic structure. In order to generate a new solution, some new structure, and therefore a new Bayesian network is sampled from the current stochastic structure and the new solution will be produced from the sampled Bayesian network. Due to the stochastic structure used in the sampling phase, each sample can be generated based on a different structure. Therefore the different dependency structures can be preserved. Before the new generation is generated, the stochastic network's probability distributions are updated according to the fitness evaluation of the current generation. The proposed method is able to take advantage of using different dependency structures through the sampling phase just by using one stochastic structure. The experimental results reported in this paper show that the proposed algorithm increases the quality of the solutions on the general optimization benchmark problems.",

They are able to take advantage of correlation structure to drive the search more efficiently, and they are able to provide insights about the structure of the search space. However, model building in high dimensions is extremely challenging, and as a result existing EDAs may become less attractive in large-scale problems because of the associated large computational requirements. Large-scale continuous global optimisation is key to many modern-day real-world problems. Scaling up EAs to large-scale problems has become one of the biggest challenges of the field. This paper pins down some fundamental roots of the problem and makes a start at developing a new and generic framework to yield effective and efficient EDA-type algorithms for large-scale continuous global optimisation problems. Our concept is to introduce an ensemble of random projections to low dimensions of the set of fittest search points as a basis for developing a new and generic divide-and-conquer methodology. Our ideas are rooted in the theory of random projections developed in theoretical computer science, and in developing and analysing our framework we exploit some recent results in nonasymptotic random matrix theory.",

While a large update strength is desirable for exploitation, there is a general trade-off : too strong updates can lead to genetic drift and poor performance. We demonstrate this trade-off for the cGA and a simple MMAS ACO algorithm on the OneMax function. More precisely, we obtain lower bounds on the expected runtime of Omega(K root n + n log n) and Omega(root n/rho + n log n), respectively, showing that the update strength should be limited to 1/K, rho = O (1/(root n log n)). In fact, choosing 1/K, rho similar to 1/(root n log n) both algorithms efficiently optimize OneMax in expected time O (n log n). Our analyses provide new insights into the stochastic behavior of probabilistic model-building GAs and propose new guidelines for setting the update strength in global optimization.",

In order to do so, we conduct experiments with Estimation of distribution algorithms as well as the fitness landscape analysis and the deception analysis. Our results indicate that the first difficulties arise from the inappropriate fitness function and representation of solutions coupled with a huge search space. The fitness landscape analysis does not reveal any significant differences that could justify the assumed jump in problem difficulty when going from Boolean functions with 6 inputs to those with 8 inputs.

Like many metaheuristics, EDAs can suffer from an autocatalytic process in which convergence begets more convergence.

The greedy approach has the disadvantage of usually becoming trapped in local optima, while the branch and bound approach, basically A* search, usually comes down to approximate search because of memory requirements, losing in this way its guaranteed optimality. Here, we carry out a comparative study of several MH algorithms (iterated local search (ILS) methods, variable neighborhood search (VNS) methods, genetic algorithms (GAs) and estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs)) and a tailored algorithm A* to address parameter estimation in GMMs. We use 22 real datasets of different complexity, all but one of which were created by the authors by preprocessing real raw data.

Some authors have suggested that employing a heavy tailed search distribution, such as a Cauchy, may make EDA better explore a high dimensional search space. However, other authors have found Cauchy search distributions are less effective than Gaussian search distributions in high dimensional problems. In this paper, we set out to resolve this controversy. To achieve this we run extensive experiments on a battery of high-dimensional test functions, and develop some theory which shows that small search steps are always more likely to move the search distribution towards the global optimum than large ones and, in particular, large search steps in high-dimensional spaces do badly in this respect with high probability. We hypothesise that, since exploration by large steps is mostly counterproductive in high dimensions, and since the fraction of good directions decays exponentially fast with increasing dimension, instead one should focus mainly on finding the right direction in which to move the search distribution. We propose a minor change to standard Gaussian EDA which implicitly achieves this aim, and our experiments on a sequence of test functions confirm the good performance of our new approach.",

Among methods that try to scale up EDA to high dimensional problems, EDA-MCC was recently proposed. It controls the complexity of the search distribution by thresholding correlation estimates as a means to approximate the prominent dependency structure among the search variables and discard irrelevant detail.|However, it is known that the correlation coefficient can only determine statistical dependence when the data distribution is Gaussian. In this paper, we develop a new variant of EDA-MCC called EDA-MCC-MI which uses mutual information (MI) estimates to determine dependencies between the search variables, replacing linear correlation. Our method is in a better position to determine the correct dependency structure than the EDA-MCC can do, simply because MI is zero if and only if the variables are independent, whereas a zero correlation does not imply independence in general. Empirical comparison results show that EDA-MCC-MI is never worse than EDA-MCC even when the search distribution is Gaussian. Our implementation employs a nonparametric MI estimator, hence it is easily extensible to any other, non-Gaussian search distribution.",

We study the proposed method in different test suites and compare its performance with some other well-known optimization methods. The comparative study demonstrates the good figures of merit of the MOCE+ method in complex test suites.

Two conflicting targets are considered: total drilling time and vibrations on the plane that is perpendicular to the drilling axis. The Pareto front, obtained through the optimization process, is analyzed through quality metrics and the available options in the decision-making process. Overall, the quality metrics of the MOCE+ method were better than the metrics of the other optimization methods considered in this work.

Thus, they do not allow for a straightforward application of traditional optimization techniques. In these settings, randomized search heuristics such as evolutionary algorithms are a popular choice because they are often assumed to exhibit some kind of resistance to noise. Empirical evidence suggests that some algorithms, such as estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) are robust against a scaling of the noise intensity, even without resorting to explicit noise-handling techniques such as resampling.|In this paper, we want to support such claims with mathematical rigor. We introduce the concept of graceful scaling in which the run time of an algorithm scales polynomially with noise intensity. We study a monotone fitness function over binary strings with additive noise taken from a Gaussian distribution. We show that myopic heuristics cannot efficiently optimize the function under arbitrarily intense noise without any explicit noise-handling. Furthermore, we prove that using a population does not help. Finally we show that a simple EDA called the Compact Genetic Algorithm can overcome the shortsightedness of mutation-only heuristics to scale gracefully with noise. We conjecture that recombinative genetic algorithms also have this property.|This extended abstract summarizes our work \"The Benefit of Recombination in Noisy Evolutionary Search,\" which appeared in Proceedings of International Symposium on Algorithms and Computation (ISAAC), 2015, pp.140-150.",

Many of the real-world problems can be decomposed into a number of sub-problems which may be solved easier. Appropriate decomposition is a significant issue specially for optimization problems where the optimal solution is usually obtained by combining the solutions of sub-problems. Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) are a type of evolutionary algorithms that learn a model of problem from the population of candidate solutions.|This model is intended to capture the interactions between problem variables, thus facilitating problem decomposition and is used to generate new solutions. In this paper, a novel type of problems is presented that is designed to challenge the model building process in discrete EDAs. The main idea is to propose a set of problems that their candidate solutions can be simultaneously decomposed into different sub-problems. This means that the candidate solution of a problem may be interpreted by two or more different structure where only one is true, resulting in the optimal solution to that problem. Some of these decompositions or structures may be more likely according to the low-order statistics collected from the population of candidate solutions, but may not necessarily lead to the optimal solution. Learning the correct structure/decomposition is a challenge for the model building process in EDA. The experimental results show that the proposed problems are indeed difficult for EDAs even when expressive models such as Bayesian networks are used to capture the interactions in the problem.",

        "description": "Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) were proposed as an alternative for traditional evolutionary algorithms in which reproduction operators could rely on information extracted from the population to enable a more effective search. Since information is usually represented as a probabilistic graphic model, the effectiveness of EDAs strongly depends on how accurately such models represent the population. In this sense, models of increasing complexity have been employed by EDAs, with the most successful ones being able to encode multivariate factorizations of joint probability distributions. However, some studies have shown that even multivariate EDAs fail to build accurate models for problems in which there is an intrinsic pairwise independence between variables. This study elucidates how pairwise independence impacts the linkage learning procedures of multivariate EDAs and affects their accuracy. First, the necessary conditions for learning additively separable functions are assessed, from which it is shown that extreme multimodality can induce pairwise independence. Second, it is demonstrated that in the presence of pairwise independence the approximate linkage learning procedures employed by many EDAs are not able to retrieve high-order dependences. Finally, in an attempt to infer how likely pairwise independence occur in practical problems, the case of non-separable functions is empirically investigated. For this purpose, the NK-model and the Linkage-Tree Genetic Algorithm (LTGA) were used as a study case and a range of usefulness for the LTGA was estimated according to N (problem size) and K (degree of interactions among variables and multimodality). The results indicated that LTGA linkage learning is probably more useful for K <= 6 on instances with random linkages (this range grows with N), and for K <= 9 on instances with nearest-neighbor linkages (this range is stable with N). Outside these ranges, pairwise independence is more likely to occur, which deteriorates models accuracy and impairs LTGA performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "description": "Data clustering is an unsupervised learning task that can be regarded as the combinatorial optimisation NP-hard problem of assigning N objects to one (or more) among k clusters. Most data clustering algorithms require the user to set a number of pre-defined parameters that have decisive impact in the formation of clusters, such as the number of clusters (initial or final), cluster radius, minimum number of objects, and similar parameters. In addition, several clustering algorithms are limited with regard to the shape of clusters that can be found, a limitation usually resulting from the optimisation process performed over a given distance metric. In this work, we propose a novel clustering algorithm that addresses the two aforementioned problems regarding the amount of parameters and cluster shape. Our approach makes use of the theory of Estimation of Distribution Algorithms in order to probabilistic sample a set of must-link/cannot link constraints in order to generate a data partition with the proper number of clusters. We name our method PASCAL, and we empirically show that it is capable of not only detecting the right number of clusters but also of properly assigning objects to the correct cluster in a variety of artificial and real problems whose solutions are known in advance.",

Several recommendation techniques have been developed since the Internet explosion to achieve this filtering task. In an attempt to recommend relevant songs to users, we propose an hybrid recommender that considers real-world users information and high-level representation for audio data. We use a deep learning technique, convolutional deep neural networks, to represent an audio segment in a n-dimensional vector, whose dimensions define the probability of the segment to belong to a specific music genre. To capture the listening behavior of a user, we investigate a state-of-the-art technique, estimation of distribution algorithms.

        "description": "Estimation of distribution algorithms are considered to be a new class of evolutionary algorithms which are applied as an alternative to genetic algorithms. Such algorithms sample the new generation from a probabilistic model of promising solutions. The search space of the optimization problem is improved by such probabilistic models. In the Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA), the set of promising solutions forms a Bayesian network and the new solutions are sampled from the built Bayesian network. This paper proposes a novel real-coded stochastic BOA for continuous global optimization by utilizing a stochastic Bayesian network. In the proposed algorithm, the new Bayesian network takes advantage of using a stochastic structure (that there is a probability distribution function for each edge in the network) and the new generation is sampled from the stochastic structure. In order to generate a new solution, some new structure, and therefore a new Bayesian network is sampled from the current stochastic structure and the new solution will be produced from the sampled Bayesian network. Due to the stochastic structure used in the sampling phase, each sample can be generated based on a different structure. Therefore the different dependency structures can be preserved. Before the new generation is generated, the stochastic network's probability distributions are updated according to the fitness evaluation of the current generation. The proposed method is able to take advantage of using different dependency structures through the sampling phase just by using one stochastic structure. The experimental results reported in this paper show that the proposed algorithm increases the quality of the solutions on the general optimization benchmark problems.",

        "description": "Estimations of distribution algorithms (EDAs) are a major branch of evolutionary algorithms (EA) with some unique advantages in principle. They are able to take advantage of correlation structure to drive the search more efficiently, and they are able to provide insights about the structure of the search space. However, model building in high dimensions is extremely challenging, and as a result existing EDAs may become less attractive in large-scale problems because of the associated large computational requirements. Large-scale continuous global optimisation is key to many modern-day real-world problems. Scaling up EAs to large-scale problems has become one of the biggest challenges of the field. This paper pins down some fundamental roots of the problem and makes a start at developing a new and generic framework to yield effective and efficient EDA-type algorithms for large-scale continuous global optimisation problems. Our concept is to introduce an ensemble of random projections to low dimensions of the set of fittest search points as a basis for developing a new and generic divide-and-conquer methodology. Our ideas are rooted in the theory of random projections developed in theoretical computer science, and in developing and analysing our framework we exploit some recent results in nonasymptotic random matrix theory.",

While a large update strength is desirable for exploitation, there is a general trade-off : too strong updates can lead to genetic drift and poor performance. We demonstrate this trade-off for the cGA and a simple MMAS ACO algorithm on the OneMax function. More precisely, we obtain lower bounds on the expected runtime of Omega(K root n + n log n) and Omega(root n/rho + n log n), respectively, showing that the update strength should be limited to 1/K, rho = O (1/(root n log n)). In fact, choosing 1/K, rho similar to 1/(root n log n) both algorithms efficiently optimize OneMax in expected time O (n log n). Our analyses provide new insights into the stochastic behavior of probabilistic model-building GAs and propose new guidelines for setting the update strength in global optimization.",

We show that EDAs that learn bivariate interactions can improve the results of GAs for some of the programs considered.

In this paper, we investigate how to obtain the maximal possible nonlinearity in balanced Boolean functions, but we also analyze how difficult is the problem itself. In order to do so, we conduct experiments with Estimation of distribution algorithms as well as the fitness landscape analysis and the deception analysis. Our results indicate that the first difficulties arise from the inappropriate fitness function and representation of solutions coupled with a huge search space. The fitness landscape analysis does not reveal any significant differences that could justify the assumed jump in problem difficulty when going from Boolean functions with 6 inputs to those with 8 inputs.

Like many metaheuristics, EDAs can suffer from an autocatalytic process in which convergence begets more convergence. In Thresheld Convergence, convergence is \"held\" back by a threshold function, and this new technique has been successfully applied to other metaheuristics to prevent autocatalytic convergence from cascading into premature convergence. In this paper, Thresheld Convergence is applied to Estimation Multivariate Normal Algorithm with a key difference: convergence is controlled in the parameter space instead of the search space.

The task we undertake is to learn parameters for defining the GMM from a dataset of complete rankings/permutations. Several approaches can be found in the literature, some of which are based on greedy search and branch and bound search. The greedy approach has the disadvantage of usually becoming trapped in local optima, while the branch and bound approach, basically A* search, usually comes down to approximate search because of memory requirements, losing in this way its guaranteed optimality. Here, we carry out a comparative study of several MH algorithms (iterated local search (ILS) methods, variable neighborhood search (VNS) methods, genetic algorithms (GAs) and estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs)) and a tailored algorithm A* to address parameter estimation in GMMs. We use 22 real datasets of different complexity, all but one of which were created by the authors by preprocessing real raw data.

        "description": "We consider the problem of high dimensional black box optimisation via Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDA) and the use of heavy-tailed search distributions in this setting. Some authors have suggested that employing a heavy tailed search distribution, such as a Cauchy, may make EDA better explore a high dimensional search space. However, other authors have found Cauchy search distributions are less effective than Gaussian search distributions in high dimensional problems. In this paper, we set out to resolve this controversy. To achieve this we run extensive experiments on a battery of high-dimensional test functions, and develop some theory which shows that small search steps are always more likely to move the search distribution towards the global optimum than large ones and, in particular, large search steps in high-dimensional spaces do badly in this respect with high probability. We hypothesise that, since exploration by large steps is mostly counterproductive in high dimensions, and since the fraction of good directions decays exponentially fast with increasing dimension, instead one should focus mainly on finding the right direction in which to move the search distribution. We propose a minor change to standard Gaussian EDA which implicitly achieves this aim, and our experiments on a sequence of test functions confirm the good performance of our new approach.",

        "description": "Most studies of Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDA) are restricted to low dimensional problems due to EDA being susceptible to the curse of dimensionality. Among methods that try to scale up EDA to high dimensional problems, EDA-MCC was recently proposed. It controls the complexity of the search distribution by thresholding correlation estimates as a means to approximate the prominent dependency structure among the search variables and discard irrelevant detail.|However, it is known that the correlation coefficient can only determine statistical dependence when the data distribution is Gaussian. In this paper, we develop a new variant of EDA-MCC called EDA-MCC-MI which uses mutual information (MI) estimates to determine dependencies between the search variables, replacing linear correlation. Our method is in a better position to determine the correct dependency structure than the EDA-MCC can do, simply because MI is zero if and only if the variables are independent, whereas a zero correlation does not imply independence in general. Empirical comparison results show that EDA-MCC-MI is never worse than EDA-MCC even when the search distribution is Gaussian. Our implementation employs a nonparametric MI estimator, hence it is easily extensible to any other, non-Gaussian search distribution.",

One of the main advantages of EDAs is that the fusion of prior information into the optimization procedure is straightforward, thereby reducing convergence time when such information is available. This study presents the modified Multi-Objective Cross-Entropy (MOCE+) method, based on a new procedure for addressing constraints: (i) the use of variable cutoff values for selecting the elitist population; and, (ii) filtering of the elitist population after each epoch. We study the proposed method in different test suites and compare its performance with some other well-known optimization methods. The comparative study demonstrates the good figures of merit of the MOCE+ method in complex test suites. Finally, the proposed method is applied to the multi-objective optimization of a micro-drilling process. Two conflicting targets are considered: total drilling time and vibrations on the plane that is perpendicular to the drilling axis. The Pareto front, obtained through the optimization process, is analyzed through quality metrics and the available options in the decision-making process. Overall, the quality metrics of the MOCE+ method were better than the metrics of the other optimization methods considered in this work. The reported optimization of the micro-drilling process with the proposed method could potentially have a direct impact on improvements in industrial efficiency. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

        "description": "Practical optimization problems frequently include uncertainty about the quality measure, for example due to noisy evaluations. Thus, they do not allow for a straightforward application of traditional optimization techniques. In these settings, randomized search heuristics such as evolutionary algorithms are a popular choice because they are often assumed to exhibit some kind of resistance to noise. Empirical evidence suggests that some algorithms, such as estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) are robust against a scaling of the noise intensity, even without resorting to explicit noise-handling techniques such as resampling.|In this paper, we want to support such claims with mathematical rigor. We introduce the concept of graceful scaling in which the run time of an algorithm scales polynomially with noise intensity. We study a monotone fitness function over binary strings with additive noise taken from a Gaussian distribution. We show that myopic heuristics cannot efficiently optimize the function under arbitrarily intense noise without any explicit noise-handling. Furthermore, we prove that using a population does not help. Finally we show that a simple EDA called the Compact Genetic Algorithm can overcome the shortsightedness of mutation-only heuristics to scale gracefully with noise. We conjecture that recombinative genetic algorithms also have this property.|This extended abstract summarizes our work \"The Benefit of Recombination in Noisy Evolutionary Search,\" which appeared in Proceedings of International Symposium on Algorithms and Computation (ISAAC), 2015, pp.140-150.",

Many of the real-world problems can be decomposed into a number of sub-problems which may be solved easier. Appropriate decomposition is a significant issue specially for optimization problems where the optimal solution is usually obtained by combining the solutions of sub-problems. Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) are a type of evolutionary algorithms that learn a model of problem from the population of candidate solutions.|This model is intended to capture the interactions between problem variables, thus facilitating problem decomposition and is used to generate new solutions. In this paper, a novel type of problems is presented that is designed to challenge the model building process in discrete EDAs. The main idea is to propose a set of problems that their candidate solutions can be simultaneously decomposed into different sub-problems. This means that the candidate solution of a problem may be interpreted by two or more different structure where only one is true, resulting in the optimal solution to that problem. Some of these decompositions or structures may be more likely according to the low-order statistics collected from the population of candidate solutions, but may not necessarily lead to the optimal solution. Learning the correct structure/decomposition is a challenge for the model building process in EDA. The experimental results show that the proposed problems are indeed difficult for EDAs even when expressive models such as Bayesian networks are used to capture the interactions in the problem.",
