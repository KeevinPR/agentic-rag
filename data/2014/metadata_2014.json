        "description": "Under certain mild condition, the Pareto-optimal set (PS) of a continuous multiobjective optimization problem, with m objectives, is a piece-wise continuous (m - 1)-dimensional manifold. This regularity property is important, yet has been unfortunately ignored in many evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) studies. The first work that explicitly takes advantages of this regularity property in EMO is the regularity model-based multiobjective estimation of distribution algorithm (RM-MEDA). However, its performance largely depends on its model parameter, which is problem dependent. Manifold learning, also known as nonlinear dimensionality reduction, is able to discover the geometric property of a low-dimensional manifold embedded in the high-dimensional ambient space. This paper presents a general framework that applies advanced manifold learning techniques in EMO. At each generation, we first use a principal curve algorithm to obtain an approximation of the PS manifold. Then, the Laplacian eigenmaps algorithm is employed to find the low-dimensional representation of this PS approximation. Afterwards, we identify the neighborhood relationship in this low-dimensional representation, which is also applicable for the original high-dimensional data. Based on the neighborhood relationship, we can interpolate new candidate solutions that obey the geometric property of the PS manifold. Empirical results validate the effectiveness of our proposal.(C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "description": "The estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) has recently emerged as a promising alternative to traditional evolutionary algorithms for solving combinatorial optimisation problems. This paper presents a novel two-phase simulation-based EDA (TPSB-EDA) for minimising the makespan of a hybrid flow shop under stochastic processing times. To address the stochastic scheduling problem efficiently, the proposed TPSB-EDA incorporates a two-phase simulation model to estimate the performance of candidate solutions. In this model, an optimal back propagation network is firstly applied to identify a set of roughly good solutions, and then the selected solutions are further evaluated by a discrete-event simulation algorithm. Moreover, an annealing selection mechanism (ASM) is adopted to preserve the population diversity of EDA. Different from the selection operators of common EDAs, the ASM uses Boltzmann probability in the annealing algorithm to select part of population to establish the probabilistic model. Computation results indicate that the TPSB-EDA provides good solutions in the aspects of solution quality and computational efficiency.",

        "description": "Predictive rule models for early warning of cyanobacterial blooms in freshwater ecosystems were developed using a hybrid evolutionary algorithm (HEA). The HEA has been designed to evolve IF-THEN-ELSE model structures using genetic programming and to optimize the stochastical constants contained in the model using population-based algorithms. This paper intensively investigates the performances of the following six alternative population-based algorithms for parameter optimization (PO) of rule models within this hybrid methodology: 1) hill climbing (HC); 2) simulated annealing (SA); 3) genetic algorithm (GA); 4) differential evolution (DE); 5) covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES); and 6) estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA). The comparative study was carried out by predictive modeling of chlorophyll-a concentrations and the potentially toxic cyanobacterium Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii cell concentrations based on water quality time-series data in Lake Wivenhoe, Queensland, Australia, from 1998 to 2009. The experimental results demonstrate that with these PO methods, the rule models discovered by the HEA proved to be both predictive and explanatory whose IF condition indicates threshold values for some crucial water quality parameters. When comparing different PO algorithms, HC always performed best followed by DE, GA, and EDA, while CMA-ES performed worst and the performance of SA varied with different data sets.",

        "description": "Decomposition-based algorithms for multi-objective optimization problems have increased in popularity in the past decade. Although convergence to the Pareto optimal front (PF) for such algorithms can often be superior to that of Pareto-based alternatives, the problem of effectively distributing Pareto optimal solutions in a high-dimensional space has not been solved. In this work, we introduce a novel concept which we call generalized decomposition. Generalized decomposition provides a framework with which the decision maker (DM) can guide the underlying search algorithm toward specific regions of interest, or the entire Pareto front, with the desired distribution of Pareto optimal solutions. The method simplifies many-objective problems by unifying the three performance objectives of an a posteriori multi-objective optimizer - convergence to the PF, evenly distributed Pareto optimal solutions and coverage of the entire front - to only one, that of convergence. A framework, established on generalized decomposition, and an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) based on low-order statistics, namely the cross-entropy method, is created to illustrate the benefits of the proposed concept for many-objective problems. The algorithm - MACE-gD - is shown to be highly competitive with the existing best-in-class decomposition-based algorithm (MOEA/D) and a more elaborate EDA method (RM-MEDA). (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

First, two special polynomially solvable cases of the problem and a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model are proposed. Since the large-scale problem needs a long time when the MIP is solved using the CPLEX, the improved estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) is proposed to solve the problem with a large size. EDA depends on the probabilistic model, which denotes the distribution of decision variables in the feasible region space. Meanwhile, EDA owns efficient search capability and convergence. To obtain an improved initial population, an efficient initialization scheme based on the feature of two special cases and a heuristic algorithm are adopted in the process of constructing the initial population. The probabilistic model is composited based on elite solutions from each generation. Simultaneously, mutation is embedded tomaintain the diversity of the population. Compared with the results, numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithm can obtain good near-optimal solutions within a short period.",

        "description": "A large number of studies have been conducted in the area of semiconductor final test scheduling (SFTS) problems. As a specific example of the simultaneous multiple resources scheduling problem, intelligent manufacturing planning and scheduling based on meta-heuristic methods, such as the genetic algorithm (GA), simulated annealing, and particle swarm optimization, have become common tools for finding satisfactory solutions within reasonable computational times in real settings. However, only a few studies have analyzed the effects of interdependent relations during group decision-making activities. Moreover, for complex and large problems, local constraints and objectives from each managerial entity and their contributions toward global objectives cannot be effectively represented in a single model. This paper proposes a novel cooperative estimation of distribution algorithm (CEDA) to overcome these challenges. The CEDA extends a co-evolutionary framework incorporating a divide-and-conquer strategy. Numerous experiments have been conducted, and the results confirmed that CEDA outperforms hybrid GAs for several SFTS problems.",

        "description": "This paper proposes a new multiobjective estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) based on joint probabilistic modeling of objectives and variables. This EDA uses the multidimensional Bayesian network as its probabilistic model. In this way, it can capture the dependencies between objectives, variables and objectives, as well as the dependencies learned between variables in other Bayesian network-based EDAs. This model leads to a problem decomposition that helps the proposed algorithm find better tradeoff solutions to the multiobjective problem. In addition to Pareto set approximation, the algorithm is also able to estimate the structure of the multiobjective problem. To apply the algorithm to many-objective problems, the algorithm includes four different ranking methods proposed in the literature for this purpose. The algorithm is first applied to the set of walking fish group problems, and its optimization performance is compared with a standard multiobjective evolutionary algorithm and another competitive multiobjective EDA. The experimental results show that on several of these problems, and for different objective space dimensions, the proposed algorithm performs significantly better and on some others achieves comparable results when compared with the other two algorithms. The algorithm is then tested on the set of CEC09 problems, where the results show that multiobjective optimization based on joint model estimation is able to obtain considerably better fronts for some of the problems compared with the search based on conventional genetic operators in the state-of-the-art multiobjective evolutionary algorithms.",

However, the economic aspects are a critical factor to extensive use of this distillation sequence in real applications. In this research, a novel stochastic optimization algorithm called Boltzmann univariate marginal distribution algorithm (BUMDA) with constraints handling has been implemented to optimize HIDiC sequences. Three binary mixtures were examined: butanol-isobutanol, n-heptane-cyclohexane, and benzene-toluene. The evaluation was performed by applying a new robust methodology using the interface Matlab-Excel-Aspen Plus. The model Radfrac was used in the simulations in Aspen Plus. The minimization of the total annual cost was established as the fitness function of the problem. Results showed the great robustness presented by the BUMDA algorithm for solving successfully this kind of complex optimization problem. Thus, the HIDiC design to separate the alcohol mixture showed energy savings of 84% and a cost that was lower (2%) than that of the conventional column. In addition, the hydrocarbon mixtures reached energy savings of 62.5% (n-heptane-cyclohexane) and 52.5% (benzene-toluene). Nevertheless, the total annual cost (TAC) of the HIDiC is larger than the TAC of the conventional column (32% and 35%, respectively).",

RM-MEDA employs a model-based method to generate new solutions, however, this method is easy to generate poor solutions when the population has no obvious regularity. To overcome this drawback, our proposed method add a new solution generation strategy, local learning, to the original RM-MEDA. Local learning produces solutions by sampling some solutions from the neighborhood of elitist solutions in the parent population. As it is easy to search some promising solutions in the neighborhood of an elitist solution, local learning can get some useful solutions which help the population attain a fast and accurate convergence. The experimental results on a set of test instances with variable linkages show that the implement of local learning can accelerate convergence speed and add a more accurate convergence to the Pareto optimal.",

        "description": "An important problem in the study of evolutionary algorithms is how to continuously predict promising solutions while simultaneously escaping from local optima. In this paper, we propose an elitist probability schema (EPS) for the first time, to the best of our knowledge. Our schema is an index of binary strings that expresses the similarity of an elitist population at every string position. EPS expresses the accumulative effect of fitness selection with respect to the coding similarity of the population. For each generation, EPS can quantify the coding similarity of the population objectively and quickly. One of our key innovations is that EPS can continuously predict promising solutions while simultaneously escaping from local optima in most cases. To demonstrate the abilities of the EPS, we designed an elitist probability schema genetic algorithm and an elitist probability schema compact genetic algorithm. These algorithms are estimations of distribution algorithms (EDAs). We provided a fair comparison with the persistent elitist compact genetic algorithm (PeCGA), quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm (QEA), and particle swarm optimization (PSO) for the 0-1 knapsack problem. The proposed algorithms converged quicker than PeCGA, QEA, and PSO, especially for the large knapsack problem. Furthermore, the computation time of the proposed algorithms was less than some EDAs that are based on building explicit probability models, and was approximately the same as QEA and PSO. This is acceptable for evolutionary algorithms, and satisfactory for EDAs. The proposed algorithms are successful with respect to convergence performance and computation time, which implies that EPS is satisfactory.",

In order to further our understandings of the collaboration between EDAs and discretization methods, in this paper, we propose a quality measure of discretization methods for EDAs. We then utilize the proposed quality measure to analyze three discretization methods: fixed-width histogram (FWH). fixed-height histogram (FHH), and greedy random split (GRS). Analytical measurements are obtained for FHH and FWH, and sampling measurements are conducted for FHH. FWH, and GRS. Furthermore, we integrate Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA), a representative EDA, with the three discretization methods to conduct experiments and to observe the performance difference. A good agreement is reached between the discretization quality measurements and the numerical optimization results.

A master-slave topology has been formulated in which the master strategically sorts out portions of the search space in four phases with the help of a clustering algorithm and assumes the role of an estimation of distribution algorithm to model the solution distribution within the space using a Gaussian mixture model without variable dependency. The new algorithm models a solution distribution by considering not only the mean vector of clustered solutions obtained from previous searches, as per the continuous univariate marginal distribution algorithm, but also by including information about the quality of solutions. With sorted probability distributions assigned by the master, slaves use genetic algorithms to extensively explore the solution space.

Then, a hybrid Pareto-archived estimation of distribution algorithm (HPAEDA) is presented to solve the MOMIRCPSP-MS-RI. To be specific, the individual of the population is encoded as the activity-mode-priority-resource list (AMPRL), and a hybrid probability model is used to predict the most promising search area, and a Pareto archive is used to preserve the non-dominated solutions that have been explored, and another archive is used to preserve the solutions for updating the probability model. Moreover, specific sampling mechanism and updating mechanism for the probability model are both provided to track the most promising search area via the EDA-based evolutionary search. Finally, the modeling methodology and the HPAEDA are tested by an example of a video codec based on the H.261 image compression standard. Simulation results and comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness of the modeling methodology and the proposed algorithm. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "description": "In this paper, a novel evolutionary algorithm called estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) is proposed for solving a special class of nonlinear bilevel programming problems (BLPPs) in which the lower level problem is a convex programming problem for each given upper level decision. This special type of BLPP is transformed into a equivalent single-level constrained optimization problem using the Karush-Kuhn-er conditions of the lower level problem. Then, we propose an EDA based on the statistical information of the superior candidate solutions to solve the transformed problem. We stress that the new population of individuals is sampled from the probabilistic distribution of those superior solutions. Thus, one of the main advantages of EDA over most other meta-heuristics is its ability to adapt the operators to the structure of the problem, although adaptation in EDA is usually limited by the initial choice of the probabilistic model. In addition, two specific rules are established in the initialization procedure to make use of the hierarchical structure of BLPPs and to handle the constraints. Moreover, without requiring the differentiability of the objective function, or the convexity of the search space of the equivalent problem, the proposed algorithm can address nonlinear BLPPs with non-differentiable or non-convex upper level objective function and upper level constraint functions. Finally, the proposed algorithm has been applied to 16 benchmark problem; in five of these problems, all of the upper level variables and lower level variables are 10-dimensional. The numerical results compared with those of other methods reveal the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

It is characterized by combining a Bayesian network and evolutionary algorithms to solve nearly decomposable optimization problems. BOA is less popularly applied to solve high dimensionality complex optimization problems. A key reason is that the cost of training all dimensions by BOA becomes expensive with the increase of problem dimensionality. Since data are relatively sparse in a high dimensional space, even though BOA can train all dimensions simultaneously, the interdependent relations between different dimensions are difficult to learn. Its search ability is thus significantly reduced. In this paper, we propose a team of Bayesian optimization algorithms (TBOA) to search and learn dimensionality. TBOA consists of multiple BOAs, in which each BOA corresponds to a dimension of the solution domain and it is responsible for the search of this dimension's value region. The proposed TBOA is used to solve the real problem of task assignment in heterogeneous computing systems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the computational cost of the overall training in TBOA is decreased very significantly while keeping high solution accuracy.",

Although several extensions of CMAES to multi-objective (MO) optimization exist, no extension incorporates a key component of the most robust and general CMA-ES variant: the association of a population with each Gaussian distribution that drives optimization. To achieve this, we use a recently introduced framework for extending population-based algorithms from single- to multi-objective optimization. We compare, using six well-known benchmark problems, the performance of the newly constructed MO-CMA- ES with existing variants and with the estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) known as iMAMaLGaM, that is also an instance of the framework, extending the single- objective EDA iAMaLGaM to MO. Results underline the advantages of being able to use populations. Because many real-world problems have constraints, we also study the use of four constraint-handling techniques. We find that CMA-ES is typically less robust to these techniques than iAMaLGaM. Moreover, whereas we could verify that a penalty method that was previously used in literature leads to fast convergence, we also find that it has a high risk of finding only nearly, but not entirely, feasible solutions. We therefore propose that other constraint-handling techniques should be preferred in general.",

Factorization encoded by models in most of the EDAs are constrained. However for optimization of many real-world problems, finding the model capable of representing complex interactions without much computational complexity overhead is the key challenge. On the other hand factor graph which is the most natural graphical model for representing additively decomposable functions is rarely employed in EDAs. In this paper we introduce Factor Graph based EDA (FGEDA) which learns factor graph as the model and estimate the probability distribution represented by the learned factor graph using Markov blanket canonical factorization. The class of factorization that is employed for approximation of distribution in FGEDA is expanded relative to famous EDAs. We have used matrix factorization for learning the factor graph of the problem based on the pairwise mutual information between pair of variables. Gibbs sampling and BB- wise crossover are used to generate new samples. Empirical evaluation as well as theoretical analysis of the approach show the efficiency and power of FGEDA in the optimization of functions with complex interactions.

We define a class of grammar that can represent the structure of a problem space as a hierarchy of multivariate patterns (schemata), and a compression algorithm that can infer an instance of the grammar from a collection of sample individuals. Unlike conventional sequential grammars the rules of the grammar define unordered set-membership productions and are therefore insensitive to gene ordering or physical linkage. We show that when grammars are inferred from populations of fit individuals on shuffled nearest-neighbour NK-landscape problems, there is a correlation between the compressibility of a population and the degree of inherent problem structure. We also demonstrate how the information captured by the grammatical model from a population can aid evolutionary search. By using the lexicon of schemata inferred into a grammar to facilitate variation, we show that a population is able to incrementally learn and then exploit its own structure to find fitter regions of the search space, and ultimately locate the global optimum.",

This paper is dedicated to extend EDA to solve one of the most active research problems - stock trading, which has been rarely revealed in the EDA literature. A recent proposed graph-based EDA called reinforced probabilistic model building genetic network programming (RPMBGNP) is investigated to create stock trading rules. With its distinguished directed graph-based individual structure and the reinforcement learning-based probabilistic modeling, we demonstrate the effectiveness of RPMBGNP for the stock trading task through real-market stock data, where much higher profits are obtained than traditional non-EDA models.",

        "description": "Based on the regularity that: the Pareto set of a continuous m-objectives problem is a piecewise continuous (m-1)-dimensional manifold, a novel hybrid multi-objective optimization algorithm is proposed in this paper. In the early evolutionary stage, traditional crossover and mutation operations are used to produce offspring, in addition, the locally linear embedding (LLE) with small neighbor parameter approach is introduced to learn the local geometry of the manifold. When certain regularity in population's distribution is detected, new offspring are sampled from the probability models created by the statistical distribution information. An entropy-based criterion is imported to determine the switching time of the two different phases of evolutionary search. The proposed hybrid multi-objective estimation of distribution algorithm combining locally linear embedding (HMOEDA_LLE) adopts several widely used test problems to conduct the comparison experiments with two state-of-the-art multi-objective evolutionary algorithms NSGA-II and RM-MEDA. The simulated results show the effectiveness of the entropy-based criterion and the proposed algorithm has better optimization performance.",

To demonstrate the importance of both priori and posteriori knowledge, in this paper, we proposes a decomposition based estimation of distribution algorithm with priori and posteriori knowledge (MEDA/D-PP) to tackle multiobjective knapsack problems (MOKPs). In MEDA/D-PP, an MOKP is decomposed into a number of single objective subproblems and those subproblems are optimized simultaneously. A probability model, which incorporates both priori and posteriori knowledge, is built for each subproblem to sample new trail solutions.

Estimation of Distribution Algorithm was proposed in which probabilistic models extracted relevant features of the complex search space and then generated new individuals during optimization. In order to decrease the dependences among control variables in dynamic optimization, affinity propagation was applied to cluster the individuals in evolutionary iterations. In each cluster, the probabilistic density function of Gaussian mixture model refined the promising spaces with high quality solutions and avoided the random combination of different control variables. To evaluate the performance of the new approach, three dynamic optimization problems of chemical process are used as cases comparing with three state-of-the-art global optimization methods.

As most Pareto based algorithms scale poorly according to the number of objectives, researchers are working on alternatives to overcome these limitations. An algorithm that has shown good results in solving MaOPs is the Iterated Multi-swarm (I-Multi) which presents a clever multi-swarm strategy to spread the solutions across different areas of the objective space while keeping a good convergence. As the I-Multi is a very recent algorithm, alternative approaches are yet to be explored. Here we investigate the use of an Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) in the multi-swarm stage of I-Multi. EDAs create a model based on the best solutions found and sample new solutions based in this model. An EDA that presents good performance is the rBOA which is a real-valued version of the Bayesian optimization algorithm. This work presents an algorithm called C-Multi consisting of a hybrid between the I-Multi and the rBOA with the aim to join the diversity strength of I-Multi and the convergence characteristic of rBOA. An experimental study is conducted using the seven well-known DTLZ test functions with 3, 5, 10, 15 and 20 objectives to evaluate the performance of the algorithms as the number of objectives scales up. The results point that the new algorithm presents superior convergence and diversity on hard problems.",

The regularity by the manifold features just build probability distribution model by globally statistical information from the population, yet, the efficiency of promising individuals is not well exploited, which is not beneficial to search and optimization process. Hereby, an incremental tournament local searcher is designed to exploit local information efficiently and accelerate convergence to the true Pareto-optimal front.

However, the Gaussian distribution as a search operator is prone to premature convergence when the population is far from the optimum. Recent work suggests that replacing the univariate Gaussian with a univariate Cauchy distribution in EDA holds promise in alleviating this problem because it is able to make larger jumps in the search space due to the Cauchy distribution's heavy tails. In this paper, we propose the use of a multivariate Cauchy distribution to blend together the advantages of multivariate modelling with the ability of escaping early convergence to efficiently explore the search space. Experiments on 16 benchmark functions demonstrate the superiority of multivariate Cauchy EDA against univariate Cauchy EDA, and its advantages against multivariate Gaussian EDA when the population lies far from the optimum.",

This study based on integration of Quantum Genetic Algorithm (QGA) and Estimation of Distribution Algorithm, EDA, (for simplicity we use Q-EDA) for flowshop scheduling, a well-known NP hard Problem, while focusing on the total flow time minimization criterion. A relatively new method has been adopted for the encoding of jobs sequence in flowshop known as angel rotations instead of random keys, so QGA become more efficient. Further, EDA has been integrated to update the population of QGA by making a probability model. This probabilistic model is built and used to generate new candidate solutions which comprised on best individuals, obtained after several repetitions of proposed (Q-EDA) approach. As both heuristics based on probabilistic characteristics, so exhibits excellent learning capability and have minimum chances of being trapped in local optima. The results obtained during this study are presented and compared with contemporary approaches in literature. The current hybrid Q-EDA has implemented on different benchmark problems. The experiments has showed better convergence and results. It is concluded that hybrid Q-EDA algorithm can generally produce better results while implemented for Flowshop Scheduling Problem (FSSP).",

From these models, new solutions can be sampled without disruption of Building Blocks, leading to a more effective search. The key aspect of EDAs is the model-building step and better models should enable a better exploration of the search space. However, high-quality models require computationally expensive algorithms, resulting in too costly EDAs. This paper proposes an efficient implementation of the tournament selection algorithm (TS), called Compressed Tournament Selection (CTS). CTS avoids the insertion of repeated solutions in the population during the TS. Therefore, model-building can be performed on a reduced population (equivalent to the original), improving the EDAs' performance as a whole. In the experiments the method was applied to the Extended Compact Genetic Algorithm and the results showed that by using an appropriate tournament size, CTS can lead to high speed-ups without a decrease of model quality. Besides, CTS keeps the characteristics of TS and can be easily used to enhance the efficiency of any EDA based on the tournament selection algorithm.",

Recently, support vector regression (SVR) has been widely applied to solve nonlinear predicting problems in many fields and has obtained good performance in many situations; however it is still difficult to optimize SVR's parameters. Previously, some optimization algorithms have been used to find better parameters of SVR, but these existing algorithms usually are not fully satisfactory. In this paper, we first improve estimation of distribution algorithms (EDA) in order to maintain the diversity of the population, and then a hybrid improved estimation of distribution algorithms (IEDA) and SVR model, called IEDA-SVR model, is proposed. IEDA is used to optimize parameters of SVR, and IEDA-SVR model is used to predict software reliability.

However, either of them has its drawback: Cartesian coordinate systems result in an enormous search space, whilst polar coordinate systems are unfit for local modifications resulting e.g., from mutation and/or crossover. In order to overcome these two drawbacks, we solve the UAV path planning in a new coordinate system. As the new coordinate system is only a rotation of Cartesian coordinate system, it is inherently easy for local modification. Besides, this new coordinate system has successfully reduced the search space by explicitly dividing the mission space into several subspaces. Within this new coordinate system, an Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) based path planner is proposed in this paper. Some experiments have been designed to test different aspects of the new path planner. The results show the effectiveness of this planner.",

Then Archimedean copula sampling algorithm is used to generate offsprings. Average ranking is used to identify the best individuals in order to guide search process. Population with the current population and current offsprings population is sorted based on average ranking, and the best individuals are selected to form the next population.

Four classic permutation benchmark problems are used to evaluate the factoradic-based algorithms in comparison with published work with other representations. Our experiments demonstrate that the factoradic representation is a competitive approach to apply to permutation problems.

Although there are some previous works on finding the strategies through coevolutionary learning using evolutionary algorithms (EAs), their coevolving strategies tend to converge to non-global optima (which bring about ineffective negotiation outcomes for participating agents) due to biased coevolution and failures in coevolution. To cope with these drawbacks, this work introduces and compares novel genetic algorithms (GAs) and estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) that have additional capability of dynamic diversity control: (1) the dynamic diversity controlling GA ((DC)-C-2-GA), (2) the dynamic diversity controlling EDA ((DC)-C-2-EDA), (3) the improved (DC)-C-2-GA ((IDC)-C-2-GA) and (4) the improved (DC)-C-2-EDA ((IDC)-C-2-EDA). While (DC)-C-2-GA and (DC)-C-2-EDA adopt the novel diversification and refinement (DR) procedure, (IDC)-C-2-GA and (IDC)-C-2-EDA adopt the modified and enhanced DR (mDR) procedure with two additional local heuristics population repair and local neighborhood search. An extensive series of experiments were carried out to compare and evaluate the performance of the simple GA (S-GA), the simple EDA (S-EDA), and the novel GAs and EDAs in coevolving effective negotiation strategies of two self-interested negotiation agents for their various deadline combinations. Favorable empirical results showed that (i) (IDC)-C-2-EDA could coevolve (near-)optimal negotiation strategies for all the considered cases due to its good generalization performance and (ii) it also generally 'outperformed S-GA, S-EDA, (DC)-C-2-GA, (DC)-C-2-EDA and (IDC)-C-2-GA in terms of solution accuracy, coevolutionary search capability and average coevolution restart ratio. Interestingly, it was also found that the coevolution performance of (IDC)-C-2-GA and (IDC)-C-2-EDA is complementary in that (IDC)-C-2-GA and (IDC)-C-2-EDA generally achieved better results in the cases of equal and different deadlines, respectively.

We start with an EDA that uses a bigram model, then extend this scheme to higher-order models. However, directly replacing the bigram model with a higher-order model often results in premature convergence. We give an explanation on why this is the case along with some empirical support for our intuition. Following that, we propose a technique that combines multiple models of different orders, which allows for smooth transition from lower-order models to higher-order ones.

The EDA literature describes necessary and unnecessary interactions in terms of the relationship between problem structure and the structure of probabilistic graphical models discovered by the EDA. In this paper we introduce a classification of problems based on monotonicity invariance. We observe that the minimal problem structures for these classes often reveal that significant proportions of detected structures are unnecessary. We perform a complete classification of all functions on 3 bits. We consider nonmonotonicity linkage discovery using perturbation methods and derive a concept of directed ordinal linkage associated to optimization schedules. The resulting refined classification factored out by relabeling, shows a hierarchy of nine directed ordinal linkage classes for all 3-bit functions. We show that this classification allows precise analysis of computational complexity and parallelizability and conclude with a number of suggestions for future work.",

In this paper, we bring the strengths of GONTEAs to the multiobjective (MO) optimization realm. To this end, we modify the linkage learning procedure and the variation operator of GOMEAs to better suit the need of finding the whole Paretooptimal front rather than a single best solution. Based on state-of-the-art studies on MOEAs; we further pinpoint and incorporate two other essential components for a scalable MO optimizer. First, the use of;in elitist archive is beneficial for keeping track of non-dominated solutions when the main population size is limited. Second, clustering can be crucial if different parts of the Pareto-optimal front need to be handled differently. By combining these elements, we construct a multi-objective GOMEA (MO-GOMEA). Experimental results on various MO optimization problems confirm the capability and scalability of our MO-GOMEA that compare favorably with those of the well-known GA NSG A11 and the more recently introduced FDA mohBOA.",

        "description": "In this paper, several variation operators based on Pareto efficiency, extracted from Differential Evolution, Estimation of Distribution Algorithms, Evolution Strategies and Evolutionary Programming, are compared in order to determine whether or not they increase the performance of the non-Pareto based versions. Firstly, we compare the selected variation operators in pairs, each operator with a modification of itself, in which we remove those elements related to the Pareto efficiency. Then, in a second experiment we compare among the selected operators, the variation operators used in the NSGA-II algorithm and the ones presented by the authors, PBCO and RBMO. In all the experiments the variation operators are incorporated in a well-known algorithm usually considered as a reference for making the comparisons, the NSGA-II algorithm. The experiments show that the Pareto based variation operators selected from the literature do not usually present a better behavior than their non-Pareto based versions; and none of them presents a better performance than the one reached by the variation operators defined by the authors, which were entirely built around the Pareto information of the individuals. These facts suggest that more effort should be placed in the design of variation operators devoted to multi-objective algorithms in order to achieve superior results to those obtained by means of general variation operators.

We show mathematically that simple rules with exponential number of resamplings lead to a log-log convergence rate. In particular, in this case the log of the distance to the optimum is linear on the log of the number of resamplings. As well as with number of resamplings polynomial in the inverse step-size. We show empirically that this convergence rate is obtained also with polynomial number of resamplings. In this polynomial resampling setting, using classical evolution strategies and an ad hoc choice of the number of resamplings, we seemingly get the same rate as those obtained with specific Estimation of Distribution Algorithms designed for noisy setting.|We also experiment non-adaptive polynomial resamplings. Compared to the state of the art, our results provide (i) proofs of log-log convergence for evolution strategies (which were not covered by existing results) in the case of objective functions with quadratic expectations and constant noise, (ii) log-log rates also for objective functions with expectation E[f(x)] = parallel to x -x*parallel to(p), where x* represents the optimum (iii) experiments with different parameterizations than those considered in the proof.

        "description": "Model-based Genetic Algorithms (GM), as the Linkage Tree Genetic Algorithm (LTGA) and most Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs), assume a reductionist perspective when solving optimization problems. They use machine-learning techniques to discover problem's substructures that might be useful to generate new solutions. This idea was grounded on Simon's near-decomposability principle and Holland's Building Block (BB)-hypothesis, and have enabled the development of effective algorithms in some contexts. Although near-decomposability is commonly seen in nature, we cannot assume the same occurs for optimization problems. Therefore, the existence of problems where these algorithms are not effective is also focus of research. Recent studies have argued that Multidimensional Knapsack Problems (MKPs) are examples of such cases. This paper extends these studies with an extensive comparison of various LTGA variants for the MKP. Using a well-known GA as reference, we analyzed the difficulties faced by the LTGA and explained why its linkage-tree model is not of much help to solve the problem. The results have shown that the LTGA was not able to outperform the GA and performed very similarly to a LTGA using random linkage-models. Further analysis of the linkage-trees, grounded on the knapsack-core concept, enabled interesting conclusions about the reason that linkage-learning did not provide useful information to solve MKPs in the settings used for the experiments.

        "description": "Artificial chromosomes with genetic algorithm (ACGA) is one of the latest versions of the estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). This algorithm has already been applied successfully to solve different kinds of scheduling problems. However, due to the fact that its probabilistic model does not consider variable interactions, ACGA may not perform well in some scheduling problems, particularly if sequence dependent setup times are considered. This is due to the fact that the previous job will influence the processing time of the next job. Simply capturing ordinal information from the parental distribution is not sufficient for a probabilistic model. As a result, this paper proposes a bi-variate probabilistic model to add into the ACGA. This new algorithm is called the ACGA2 and is used to solve single machine scheduling problems with sequence-dependent setup times in a common due-date environment. A theoretical analysis is given in this paper. Some heuristics and local search algorithm variable neighborhood search (VNS) are also employed in the ACGA2. The results indicate that the average error ratio of this ACGA2 is half the error ratio of the ACGA. In addition, when ACGA2 is applied in combination with other heuristic methods and VNS, the hybrid algorithm achieves optimal solution quality in comparison with other algorithms in the literature. Thus, the proposed algorithms are effective for solving the scheduling problems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.",

        "description": "We consider the problem of high dimensional black-box optimisation via Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDA). The Gaussian distribution is commonly used as a search operator in most of the EDA methods. However there are indications in the literature that heavy tailed distributions may perform better due to their higher exploration capabilities. Univariate heavy tailed distributions were already proposed for high dimensional problems. In 2D problems it has been reported that a multivariate heavy tailed (such as Cauchy) search distribution is able to blend together the strengths of multivariate modelling with a high exploration power. In this paper, we study whether a similar scheme would work well in high dimensional search problems. To get around of the difficulty of multivariate model building in high dimensions we employ a recently proposed random projections (RP) ensemble based approach which we modify to get samples from a multivariate Cauchy using the scale-mixture representation of the Cauchy distribution. Our experiments show that the resulting RP-based multivariate Cauchy EDA consistently improves on the performance of the univariate Cauchy search distribution. However, intriguingly, the RP-based multivariate Gaussian EDA has the best performance among these methods. It appears that the highly explorative nature of the multivariate Cauchy sampling is exacerbated in high dimensional search spaces and the population based search loses its focus and effectiveness as a result. Finally, we present an idea to increase exploration while maintaining exploitation and focus by using the RP-based multivariate Gaussian EDA in which the RP matrices are drawn with i.i.d. heavy tailed entries. This achieves improved performance and is competitive with the state of the art.",

From these models, new solutions can be sampled without disruption of Building Blocks, leading to a more effective search. The key aspect of EDAs is the model-building step and better models should enable a better exploration of the search space. However, high-quality models require computationally expensive algorithms, resulting in too costly EDAs. This paper proposes an efficient implementation of the tournament selection algorithm (TS), called Compressed Tournament Selection (CTS). CTS avoids the insertion of repeated solutions in the population during the TS. Therefore, model-building can be performed on a reduced population (equivalent to the original), improving the EDAs' performance as a whole. In the experiments the method was applied to the Extended Compact Genetic Algorithm and the results showed that by using an appropriate tournament size, CTS can lead to high speed-ups without a decrease of model quality. Besides, CTS keeps the characteristics of TS and can be easily used to enhance the efficiency of any EDA based on the tournament selection algorithm.",

The data during software lifecycle is used to analyze and predict software reliability. However, predicting the variability of software reliability with time is very difficult. Recently, support vector regression (SVR) has been widely applied to solve nonlinear predicting problems in many fields and has obtained good performance in many situations; however it is still difficult to optimize SVR's parameters. Previously, some optimization algorithms have been used to find better parameters of SVR, but these existing algorithms usually are not fully satisfactory. In this paper, we first improve estimation of distribution algorithms (EDA) in order to maintain the diversity of the population, and then a hybrid improved estimation of distribution algorithms (IEDA) and SVR model, called IEDA-SVR model, is proposed. IEDA is used to optimize parameters of SVR, and IEDA-SVR model is used to predict software reliability. We compare IEDA-SVR model with other software reliability models using real software failure data sets.

However, either of them has its drawback: Cartesian coordinate systems result in an enormous search space, whilst polar coordinate systems are unfit for local modifications resulting e.g., from mutation and/or crossover. In order to overcome these two drawbacks, we solve the UAV path planning in a new coordinate system. As the new coordinate system is only a rotation of Cartesian coordinate system, it is inherently easy for local modification. Besides, this new coordinate system has successfully reduced the search space by explicitly dividing the mission space into several subspaces. Within this new coordinate system, an Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) based path planner is proposed in this paper. Some experiments have been designed to test different aspects of the new path planner. The results show the effectiveness of this planner.",

Although there are some previous works on finding the strategies through coevolutionary learning using evolutionary algorithms (EAs), their coevolving strategies tend to converge to non-global optima (which bring about ineffective negotiation outcomes for participating agents) due to biased coevolution and failures in coevolution. To cope with these drawbacks, this work introduces and compares novel genetic algorithms (GAs) and estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) that have additional capability of dynamic diversity control: (1) the dynamic diversity controlling GA ((DC)-C-2-GA), (2) the dynamic diversity controlling EDA ((DC)-C-2-EDA), (3) the improved (DC)-C-2-GA ((IDC)-C-2-GA) and (4) the improved (DC)-C-2-EDA ((IDC)-C-2-EDA). While (DC)-C-2-GA and (DC)-C-2-EDA adopt the novel diversification and refinement (DR) procedure, (IDC)-C-2-GA and (IDC)-C-2-EDA adopt the modified and enhanced DR (mDR) procedure with two additional local heuristics population repair and local neighborhood search. An extensive series of experiments were carried out to compare and evaluate the performance of the simple GA (S-GA), the simple EDA (S-EDA), and the novel GAs and EDAs in coevolving effective negotiation strategies of two self-interested negotiation agents for their various deadline combinations. Favorable empirical results showed that (i) (IDC)-C-2-EDA could coevolve (near-)optimal negotiation strategies for all the considered cases due to its good generalization performance and (ii) it also generally 'outperformed S-GA, S-EDA, (DC)-C-2-GA, (DC)-C-2-EDA and (IDC)-C-2-GA in terms of solution accuracy, coevolutionary search capability and average coevolution restart ratio. Interestingly, it was also found that the coevolution performance of (IDC)-C-2-GA and (IDC)-C-2-EDA is complementary in that (IDC)-C-2-GA and (IDC)-C-2-EDA generally achieved better results in the cases of equal and different deadlines, respectively.

        "description": "Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) have emerged from the synergy between machine-learning techniques and Genetic Algorithms (GAs). EDAs rely on probabilistic modeling for obtaining information about the underlying structure of optimization problems and implementing effective reproduction operators. The effectiveness of EDAs depends on the capacity of the model-building to extract reliable information about the problem. In this study we analyze additively separable functions and argue that the degree of multimodality of such functions defines their linkage-learning difficulty. Besides, by using entropy-based concepts and Jensen's inequality, we show how allelic pairwise independence may appear as a consequence of an increasing multimodality. The results characterize the linkage-learning difficulty of well-known functions, like the deceptive trap, bipolar and concatenated parity.",

Specifically, we focus on the use of probabilistic models that are based on n-gram statistics. These models have been used extensively in modeling statistical properties of sequences. We start with an EDA that uses a bigram model, then extend this scheme to higher-order models. However, directly replacing the bigram model with a higher-order model often results in premature convergence. We give an explanation on why this is the case along with some empirical support for our intuition. Following that, we propose a technique that combines multiple models of different orders, which allows for smooth transition from lower-order models to higher-order ones. Furthermore, this technique can also be used to incorporate other heuristics and prior knowledge about the problem into the search mechanism.",

Existing discretization algorithms, such as the fixed-height histogram (FHH) and the split-on-demand (SoD), utilize merely densities of selected chromosomes to build next-generation population, and therefore have limited exploration. This paper adds the concept of model building to FHH and SoD to solve these problems. The model utilizes a variety of information from selected chromosomes to improve the abilities of FHH and SoD to identify promising regions for future exploration. Specifically, a model of expected values of selected chromosomes is combined with FHH and SoD to form expected-value FHH and expected-value SoD. The expected-value-discretization algorithms outperform their original versions on an exploration test function as well as the 25 benchmark functions used in the SoD paper. This paper also introduces a model of differential-expected-value of selected chromosomes. The differential-expected-value FHH and differential-expected-value SoD outperform their expected-value versions when tested on the exploration test function and the 25 benchmark functions.",

Discovering structure is a feature of a range of algorithms, including estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) and perturbation methods (PMs). The complexity of structure has traditionally been used as a broad measure of problem difficulty, as the computational complexity relates directly to the complexity of structure. The EDA literature describes necessary and unnecessary interactions in terms of the relationship between problem structure and the structure of probabilistic graphical models discovered by the EDA. In this paper we introduce a classification of problems based on monotonicity invariance. We observe that the minimal problem structures for these classes often reveal that significant proportions of detected structures are unnecessary. We perform a complete classification of all functions on 3 bits. We consider nonmonotonicity linkage discovery using perturbation methods and derive a concept of directed ordinal linkage associated to optimization schedules. The resulting refined classification factored out by relabeling, shows a hierarchy of nine directed ordinal linkage classes for all 3-bit functions. We show that this classification allows precise analysis of computational complexity and parallelizability and conclude with a number of suggestions for future work.",

Firstly, we compare the selected variation operators in pairs, each operator with a modification of itself, in which we remove those elements related to the Pareto efficiency. Then, in a second experiment we compare among the selected operators, the variation operators used in the NSGA-II algorithm and the ones presented by the authors, PBCO and RBMO. In all the experiments the variation operators are incorporated in a well-known algorithm usually considered as a reference for making the comparisons, the NSGA-II algorithm. The experiments show that the Pareto based variation operators selected from the literature do not usually present a better behavior than their non-Pareto based versions; and none of them presents a better performance than the one reached by the variation operators defined by the authors, which were entirely built around the Pareto information of the individuals. These facts suggest that more effort should be placed in the design of variation operators devoted to multi-objective algorithms in order to achieve superior results to those obtained by means of general variation operators.

We show empirically that this convergence rate is obtained also with polynomial number of resamplings. In this polynomial resampling setting, using classical evolution strategies and an ad hoc choice of the number of resamplings, we seemingly get the same rate as those obtained with specific Estimation of Distribution Algorithms designed for noisy setting.|We also experiment non-adaptive polynomial resamplings. Compared to the state of the art, our results provide (i) proofs of log-log convergence for evolution strategies (which were not covered by existing results) in the case of objective functions with quadratic expectations and constant noise, (ii) log-log rates also for objective functions with expectation E[f(x)] = parallel to x -x*parallel to(p), where x* represents the optimum (iii) experiments with different parameterizations than those considered in the proof.

        "description": "Model-based Genetic Algorithms (GM), as the Linkage Tree Genetic Algorithm (LTGA) and most Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs), assume a reductionist perspective when solving optimization problems. They use machine-learning techniques to discover problem's substructures that might be useful to generate new solutions. This idea was grounded on Simon's near-decomposability principle and Holland's Building Block (BB)-hypothesis, and have enabled the development of effective algorithms in some contexts. Although near-decomposability is commonly seen in nature, we cannot assume the same occurs for optimization problems. Therefore, the existence of problems where these algorithms are not effective is also focus of research. Recent studies have argued that Multidimensional Knapsack Problems (MKPs) are examples of such cases. This paper extends these studies with an extensive comparison of various LTGA variants for the MKP. Using a well-known GA as reference, we analyzed the difficulties faced by the LTGA and explained why its linkage-tree model is not of much help to solve the problem. The results have shown that the LTGA was not able to outperform the GA and performed very similarly to a LTGA using random linkage-models. Further analysis of the linkage-trees, grounded on the knapsack-core concept, enabled interesting conclusions about the reason that linkage-learning did not provide useful information to solve MKPs in the settings used for the experiments.

        "description": "Artificial chromosomes with genetic algorithm (ACGA) is one of the latest versions of the estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). This algorithm has already been applied successfully to solve different kinds of scheduling problems. However, due to the fact that its probabilistic model does not consider variable interactions, ACGA may not perform well in some scheduling problems, particularly if sequence dependent setup times are considered. This is due to the fact that the previous job will influence the processing time of the next job. Simply capturing ordinal information from the parental distribution is not sufficient for a probabilistic model. As a result, this paper proposes a bi-variate probabilistic model to add into the ACGA. This new algorithm is called the ACGA2 and is used to solve single machine scheduling problems with sequence-dependent setup times in a common due-date environment. A theoretical analysis is given in this paper. Some heuristics and local search algorithm variable neighborhood search (VNS) are also employed in the ACGA2. The results indicate that the average error ratio of this ACGA2 is half the error ratio of the ACGA. In addition, when ACGA2 is applied in combination with other heuristic methods and VNS, the hybrid algorithm achieves optimal solution quality in comparison with other algorithms in the literature. Thus, the proposed algorithms are effective for solving the scheduling problems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.",

        "description": "We consider the problem of high dimensional black-box optimisation via Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDA). The Gaussian distribution is commonly used as a search operator in most of the EDA methods. However there are indications in the literature that heavy tailed distributions may perform better due to their higher exploration capabilities. Univariate heavy tailed distributions were already proposed for high dimensional problems. In 2D problems it has been reported that a multivariate heavy tailed (such as Cauchy) search distribution is able to blend together the strengths of multivariate modelling with a high exploration power. In this paper, we study whether a similar scheme would work well in high dimensional search problems. To get around of the difficulty of multivariate model building in high dimensions we employ a recently proposed random projections (RP) ensemble based approach which we modify to get samples from a multivariate Cauchy using the scale-mixture representation of the Cauchy distribution. Our experiments show that the resulting RP-based multivariate Cauchy EDA consistently improves on the performance of the univariate Cauchy search distribution. However, intriguingly, the RP-based multivariate Gaussian EDA has the best performance among these methods. It appears that the highly explorative nature of the multivariate Cauchy sampling is exacerbated in high dimensional search spaces and the population based search loses its focus and effectiveness as a result. Finally, we present an idea to increase exploration while maintaining exploitation and focus by using the RP-based multivariate Gaussian EDA in which the RP matrices are drawn with i.i.d. heavy tailed entries. This achieves improved performance and is competitive with the state of the art.",

From these models, new solutions can be sampled without disruption of Building Blocks, leading to a more effective search. The key aspect of EDAs is the model-building step and better models should enable a better exploration of the search space. However, high-quality models require computationally expensive algorithms, resulting in too costly EDAs. This paper proposes an efficient implementation of the tournament selection algorithm (TS), called Compressed Tournament Selection (CTS). CTS avoids the insertion of repeated solutions in the population during the TS. Therefore, model-building can be performed on a reduced population (equivalent to the original), improving the EDAs' performance as a whole. In the experiments the method was applied to the Extended Compact Genetic Algorithm and the results showed that by using an appropriate tournament size, CTS can lead to high speed-ups without a decrease of model quality. Besides, CTS keeps the characteristics of TS and can be easily used to enhance the efficiency of any EDA based on the tournament selection algorithm.",

In order to overcome these two drawbacks, we solve the UAV path planning in a new coordinate system. As the new coordinate system is only a rotation of Cartesian coordinate system, it is inherently easy for local modification. Besides, this new coordinate system has successfully reduced the search space by explicitly dividing the mission space into several subspaces.

While (DC)-C-2-GA and (DC)-C-2-EDA adopt the novel diversification and refinement (DR) procedure, (IDC)-C-2-GA and (IDC)-C-2-EDA adopt the modified and enhanced DR (mDR) procedure with two additional local heuristics population repair and local neighborhood search. An extensive series of experiments were carried out to compare and evaluate the performance of the simple GA (S-GA), the simple EDA (S-EDA), and the novel GAs and EDAs in coevolving effective negotiation strategies of two self-interested negotiation agents for their various deadline combinations. Favorable empirical results showed that (i) (IDC)-C-2-EDA could coevolve (near-)optimal negotiation strategies for all the considered cases due to its good generalization performance and (ii) it also generally 'outperformed S-GA, S-EDA, (DC)-C-2-GA, (DC)-C-2-EDA and (IDC)-C-2-GA in terms of solution accuracy, coevolutionary search capability and average coevolution restart ratio. Interestingly, it was also found that the coevolution performance of (IDC)-C-2-GA and (IDC)-C-2-EDA is complementary in that (IDC)-C-2-GA and (IDC)-C-2-EDA generally achieved better results in the cases of equal and different deadlines, respectively.

In this study we analyze additively separable functions and argue that the degree of multimodality of such functions defines their linkage-learning difficulty. Besides, by using entropy-based concepts and Jensen's inequality, we show how allelic pairwise independence may appear as a consequence of an increasing multimodality.

Specifically, we focus on the use of probabilistic models that are based on n-gram statistics. These models have been used extensively in modeling statistical properties of sequences. We start with an EDA that uses a bigram model, then extend this scheme to higher-order models. However, directly replacing the bigram model with a higher-order model often results in premature convergence. We give an explanation on why this is the case along with some empirical support for our intuition. Following that, we propose a technique that combines multiple models of different orders, which allows for smooth transition from lower-order models to higher-order ones. Furthermore, this technique can also be used to incorporate other heuristics and prior knowledge about the problem into the search mechanism.",

This paper adds the concept of model building to FHH and SoD to solve these problems. The model utilizes a variety of information from selected chromosomes to improve the abilities of FHH and SoD to identify promising regions for future exploration. Specifically, a model of expected values of selected chromosomes is combined with FHH and SoD to form expected-value FHH and expected-value SoD. The expected-value-discretization algorithms outperform their original versions on an exploration test function as well as the 25 benchmark functions used in the SoD paper. This paper also introduces a model of differential-expected-value of selected chromosomes.

Discovering structure is a feature of a range of algorithms, including estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) and perturbation methods (PMs). The complexity of structure has traditionally been used as a broad measure of problem difficulty, as the computational complexity relates directly to the complexity of structure. The EDA literature describes necessary and unnecessary interactions in terms of the relationship between problem structure and the structure of probabilistic graphical models discovered by the EDA. In this paper we introduce a classification of problems based on monotonicity invariance. We observe that the minimal problem structures for these classes often reveal that significant proportions of detected structures are unnecessary. We perform a complete classification of all functions on 3 bits. We consider nonmonotonicity linkage discovery using perturbation methods and derive a concept of directed ordinal linkage associated to optimization schedules. The resulting refined classification factored out by relabeling, shows a hierarchy of nine directed ordinal linkage classes for all 3-bit functions. We show that this classification allows precise analysis of computational complexity and parallelizability and conclude with a number of suggestions for future work.",

Firstly, we compare the selected variation operators in pairs, each operator with a modification of itself, in which we remove those elements related to the Pareto efficiency. Then, in a second experiment we compare among the selected operators, the variation operators used in the NSGA-II algorithm and the ones presented by the authors, PBCO and RBMO. In all the experiments the variation operators are incorporated in a well-known algorithm usually considered as a reference for making the comparisons, the NSGA-II algorithm. The experiments show that the Pareto based variation operators selected from the literature do not usually present a better behavior than their non-Pareto based versions; and none of them presents a better performance than the one reached by the variation operators defined by the authors, which were entirely built around the Pareto information of the individuals. These facts suggest that more effort should be placed in the design of variation operators devoted to multi-objective algorithms in order to achieve superior results to those obtained by means of general variation operators.

We show empirically that this convergence rate is obtained also with polynomial number of resamplings. In this polynomial resampling setting, using classical evolution strategies and an ad hoc choice of the number of resamplings, we seemingly get the same rate as those obtained with specific Estimation of Distribution Algorithms designed for noisy setting.|We also experiment non-adaptive polynomial resamplings. Compared to the state of the art, our results provide (i) proofs of log-log convergence for evolution strategies (which were not covered by existing results) in the case of objective functions with quadratic expectations and constant noise, (ii) log-log rates also for objective functions with expectation E[f(x)] = parallel to x -x*parallel to(p), where x* represents the optimum (iii) experiments with different parameterizations than those considered in the proof.

        "description": "Model-based Genetic Algorithms (GM), as the Linkage Tree Genetic Algorithm (LTGA) and most Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs), assume a reductionist perspective when solving optimization problems. They use machine-learning techniques to discover problem's substructures that might be useful to generate new solutions. This idea was grounded on Simon's near-decomposability principle and Holland's Building Block (BB)-hypothesis, and have enabled the development of effective algorithms in some contexts. Although near-decomposability is commonly seen in nature, we cannot assume the same occurs for optimization problems. Therefore, the existence of problems where these algorithms are not effective is also focus of research. Recent studies have argued that Multidimensional Knapsack Problems (MKPs) are examples of such cases. This paper extends these studies with an extensive comparison of various LTGA variants for the MKP. Using a well-known GA as reference, we analyzed the difficulties faced by the LTGA and explained why its linkage-tree model is not of much help to solve the problem. The results have shown that the LTGA was not able to outperform the GA and performed very similarly to a LTGA using random linkage-models. Further analysis of the linkage-trees, grounded on the knapsack-core concept, enabled interesting conclusions about the reason that linkage-learning did not provide useful information to solve MKPs in the settings used for the experiments.

        "description": "Artificial chromosomes with genetic algorithm (ACGA) is one of the latest versions of the estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). This algorithm has already been applied successfully to solve different kinds of scheduling problems. However, due to the fact that its probabilistic model does not consider variable interactions, ACGA may not perform well in some scheduling problems, particularly if sequence dependent setup times are considered. This is due to the fact that the previous job will influence the processing time of the next job. Simply capturing ordinal information from the parental distribution is not sufficient for a probabilistic model. As a result, this paper proposes a bi-variate probabilistic model to add into the ACGA. This new algorithm is called the ACGA2 and is used to solve single machine scheduling problems with sequence-dependent setup times in a common due-date environment. A theoretical analysis is given in this paper. Some heuristics and local search algorithm variable neighborhood search (VNS) are also employed in the ACGA2. The results indicate that the average error ratio of this ACGA2 is half the error ratio of the ACGA. In addition, when ACGA2 is applied in combination with other heuristic methods and VNS, the hybrid algorithm achieves optimal solution quality in comparison with other algorithms in the literature. Thus, the proposed algorithms are effective for solving the scheduling problems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.",

        "description": "We consider the problem of high dimensional black-box optimisation via Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDA). The Gaussian distribution is commonly used as a search operator in most of the EDA methods. However there are indications in the literature that heavy tailed distributions may perform better due to their higher exploration capabilities. Univariate heavy tailed distributions were already proposed for high dimensional problems. In 2D problems it has been reported that a multivariate heavy tailed (such as Cauchy) search distribution is able to blend together the strengths of multivariate modelling with a high exploration power. In this paper, we study whether a similar scheme would work well in high dimensional search problems. To get around of the difficulty of multivariate model building in high dimensions we employ a recently proposed random projections (RP) ensemble based approach which we modify to get samples from a multivariate Cauchy using the scale-mixture representation of the Cauchy distribution. Our experiments show that the resulting RP-based multivariate Cauchy EDA consistently improves on the performance of the univariate Cauchy search distribution. However, intriguingly, the RP-based multivariate Gaussian EDA has the best performance among these methods. It appears that the highly explorative nature of the multivariate Cauchy sampling is exacerbated in high dimensional search spaces and the population based search loses its focus and effectiveness as a result. Finally, we present an idea to increase exploration while maintaining exploitation and focus by using the RP-based multivariate Gaussian EDA in which the RP matrices are drawn with i.i.d. heavy tailed entries. This achieves improved performance and is competitive with the state of the art.",

From these models, new solutions can be sampled without disruption of Building Blocks, leading to a more effective search. The key aspect of EDAs is the model-building step and better models should enable a better exploration of the search space. However, high-quality models require computationally expensive algorithms, resulting in too costly EDAs. This paper proposes an efficient implementation of the tournament selection algorithm (TS), called Compressed Tournament Selection (CTS). CTS avoids the insertion of repeated solutions in the population during the TS. Therefore, model-building can be performed on a reduced population (equivalent to the original), improving the EDAs' performance as a whole. In the experiments the method was applied to the Extended Compact Genetic Algorithm and the results showed that by using an appropriate tournament size, CTS can lead to high speed-ups without a decrease of model quality. Besides, CTS keeps the characteristics of TS and can be easily used to enhance the efficiency of any EDA based on the tournament selection algorithm.",

Previously, some optimization algorithms have been used to find better parameters of SVR, but these existing algorithms usually are not fully satisfactory.

However, either of them has its drawback: Cartesian coordinate systems result in an enormous search space, whilst polar coordinate systems are unfit for local modifications resulting e.g., from mutation and/or crossover. In order to overcome these two drawbacks, we solve the UAV path planning in a new coordinate system. As the new coordinate system is only a rotation of Cartesian coordinate system, it is inherently easy for local modification. Besides, this new coordinate system has successfully reduced the search space by explicitly dividing the mission space into several subspaces. Within this new coordinate system, an Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) based path planner is proposed in this paper. Some experiments have been designed to test different aspects of the new path planner. The results show the effectiveness of this planner.",

It is shown in this work how the incorporation of copula functions and graphical models for modeling the dependencies among variables provides some theoretical advantages over traditional EDAs. By means of copula functions and two well known graphical models, this paper presents a novel approach for defining new EDAs. Either dependence is modeled by a copula function chosen from a predefined set of six functions that aim to cover a wide range of inter-relations. It is also shown how the use of mutual information in the learning of graphical models implies a natural way of employing copula entropies. The experimental results on separable and non-separable functions show that the two new EDAs, which adopt copula functions to model dependencies, perform better than their original version with Gaussian variables.",

        "description": "Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) are a class of evolutionary optimization algorithms based on probability distribution model. This chapter extends the basic EDAs for tackling multiobjective optimization problems by incorporating multivariate Archimedean copulas for constructing probability distribution model, and using the concept of average ranking. In the algorithm, Archimedean copula is used to construct probability distribution model in EDA. By estimating Kendall's tau and using the relationship of parameter of Archimedean copula generator and Kendall's tau, the parameter of generator in Archimedean copula are first estimated from the current population. Then Archimedean copula sampling algorithm is used to generate offsprings. Average ranking is used to identify the best individuals in order to guide search process. Population with the current population and current offsprings population is sorted based on average ranking, and the best individuals are selected to form the next population. The algorithm is tested to compare with NSGA-II, GDE, MOEP, and MOPSO based on convergence metric and diversity metric using a set of benchmark functions. Experimental results show that the algorithm is effective on the benchmark functions.",

In particular, permutation representations suitable for Estimation of Distribution algorithms (EDAs) are known to present several challenges. Therefore, it is of interest to investigate novel representations and their properties. In this paper, we present a study of the factoradic representation which offers new modelling insights through the use of three algorithmic frameworks, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and two EDAs. Four classic permutation benchmark problems are used to evaluate the factoradic-based algorithms in comparison with published work with other representations. Our experiments demonstrate that the factoradic representation is a competitive approach to apply to permutation problems. EDAs and more specifically, univariate EDAs show the most robust performance on the benchmarks studied. The factoradic representation also leads to better performance than adaptations of EDAs for continuous spaces, overall similar performance to integer-based EDAs and occasionally matches results of specialised EDAs, justifying further study.",

        "description": "Finding optimal strategies for negotiation with incomplete information is a challenging issue in agent-based automated negotiation research. Although there are some previous works on finding the strategies through coevolutionary learning using evolutionary algorithms (EAs), their coevolving strategies tend to converge to non-global optima (which bring about ineffective negotiation outcomes for participating agents) due to biased coevolution and failures in coevolution. To cope with these drawbacks, this work introduces and compares novel genetic algorithms (GAs) and estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) that have additional capability of dynamic diversity control: (1) the dynamic diversity controlling GA ((DC)-C-2-GA), (2) the dynamic diversity controlling EDA ((DC)-C-2-EDA), (3) the improved (DC)-C-2-GA ((IDC)-C-2-GA) and (4) the improved (DC)-C-2-EDA ((IDC)-C-2-EDA). While (DC)-C-2-GA and (DC)-C-2-EDA adopt the novel diversification and refinement (DR) procedure, (IDC)-C-2-GA and (IDC)-C-2-EDA adopt the modified and enhanced DR (mDR) procedure with two additional local heuristics population repair and local neighborhood search. An extensive series of experiments were carried out to compare and evaluate the performance of the simple GA (S-GA), the simple EDA (S-EDA), and the novel GAs and EDAs in coevolving effective negotiation strategies of two self-interested negotiation agents for their various deadline combinations. Favorable empirical results showed that (i) (IDC)-C-2-EDA could coevolve (near-)optimal negotiation strategies for all the considered cases due to its good generalization performance and (ii) it also generally 'outperformed S-GA, S-EDA, (DC)-C-2-GA, (DC)-C-2-EDA and (IDC)-C-2-GA in terms of solution accuracy, coevolutionary search capability and average coevolution restart ratio. Interestingly, it was also found that the coevolution performance of (IDC)-C-2-GA and (IDC)-C-2-EDA is complementary in that (IDC)-C-2-GA and (IDC)-C-2-EDA generally achieved better results in the cases of equal and different deadlines, respectively.

The computational effort in generating the supervised information is reduced by an active learning strategy. In particular, the model is learned from a set of informative training objective vectors. The training objective vectors are approximated Pareto-optimal vectors obtained by solving different scalarized problem instances. The experimental results show that ALP achieves an accurate Pareto front approximation with a lower computational effort than state-of-the-art estimation of distribution algorithms and widely known genetic techniques.",

EDAs rely on probabilistic modeling for obtaining information about the underlying structure of optimization problems and implementing effective reproduction operators. The effectiveness of EDAs depends on the capacity of the model-building to extract reliable information about the problem. In this study we analyze additively separable functions and argue that the degree of multimodality of such functions defines their linkage-learning difficulty. Besides, by using entropy-based concepts and Jensen's inequality, we show how allelic pairwise independence may appear as a consequence of an increasing multimodality. The results characterize the linkage-learning difficulty of well-known functions, like the deceptive trap, bipolar and concatenated parity.",

Specifically, we focus on the use of probabilistic models that are based on n-gram statistics. These models have been used extensively in modeling statistical properties of sequences. We start with an EDA that uses a bigram model, then extend this scheme to higher-order models. However, directly replacing the bigram model with a higher-order model often results in premature convergence. We give an explanation on why this is the case along with some empirical support for our intuition. Following that, we propose a technique that combines multiple models of different orders, which allows for smooth transition from lower-order models to higher-order ones. Furthermore, this technique can also be used to incorporate other heuristics and prior knowledge about the problem into the search mechanism.",

Existing discretization algorithms, such as the fixed-height histogram (FHH) and the split-on-demand (SoD), utilize merely densities of selected chromosomes to build next-generation population, and therefore have limited exploration. This paper adds the concept of model building to FHH and SoD to solve these problems. The model utilizes a variety of information from selected chromosomes to improve the abilities of FHH and SoD to identify promising regions for future exploration. Specifically, a model of expected values of selected chromosomes is combined with FHH and SoD to form expected-value FHH and expected-value SoD. The expected-value-discretization algorithms outperform their original versions on an exploration test function as well as the 25 benchmark functions used in the SoD paper. This paper also introduces a model of differential-expected-value of selected chromosomes. The differential-expected-value FHH and differential-expected-value SoD outperform their expected-value versions when tested on the exploration test function and the 25 benchmark functions.",

Discovering structure is a feature of a range of algorithms, including estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) and perturbation methods (PMs). The complexity of structure has traditionally been used as a broad measure of problem difficulty, as the computational complexity relates directly to the complexity of structure. The EDA literature describes necessary and unnecessary interactions in terms of the relationship between problem structure and the structure of probabilistic graphical models discovered by the EDA. In this paper we introduce a classification of problems based on monotonicity invariance. We observe that the minimal problem structures for these classes often reveal that significant proportions of detected structures are unnecessary. We perform a complete classification of all functions on 3 bits. We consider nonmonotonicity linkage discovery using perturbation methods and derive a concept of directed ordinal linkage associated to optimization schedules. The resulting refined classification factored out by relabeling, shows a hierarchy of nine directed ordinal linkage classes for all 3-bit functions. We show that this classification allows precise analysis of computational complexity and parallelizability and conclude with a number of suggestions for future work.",

Firstly, we compare the selected variation operators in pairs, each operator with a modification of itself, in which we remove those elements related to the Pareto efficiency. Then, in a second experiment we compare among the selected operators, the variation operators used in the NSGA-II algorithm and the ones presented by the authors, PBCO and RBMO. In all the experiments the variation operators are incorporated in a well-known algorithm usually considered as a reference for making the comparisons, the NSGA-II algorithm. The experiments show that the Pareto based variation operators selected from the literature do not usually present a better behavior than their non-Pareto based versions; and none of them presents a better performance than the one reached by the variation operators defined by the authors, which were entirely built around the Pareto information of the individuals. These facts suggest that more effort should be placed in the design of variation operators devoted to multi-objective algorithms in order to achieve superior results to those obtained by means of general variation operators.

We show empirically that this convergence rate is obtained also with polynomial number of resamplings. In this polynomial resampling setting, using classical evolution strategies and an ad hoc choice of the number of resamplings, we seemingly get the same rate as those obtained with specific Estimation of Distribution Algorithms designed for noisy setting.|We also experiment non-adaptive polynomial resamplings. Compared to the state of the art, our results provide (i) proofs of log-log convergence for evolution strategies (which were not covered by existing results) in the case of objective functions with quadratic expectations and constant noise, (ii) log-log rates also for objective functions with expectation E[f(x)] = parallel to x -x*parallel to(p), where x* represents the optimum (iii) experiments with different parameterizations than those considered in the proof.

They use machine-learning techniques to discover problem's substructures that might be useful to generate new solutions. This idea was grounded on Simon's near-decomposability principle and Holland's Building Block (BB)-hypothesis, and have enabled the development of effective algorithms in some contexts. Although near-decomposability is commonly seen in nature, we cannot assume the same occurs for optimization problems. Therefore, the existence of problems where these algorithms are not effective is also focus of research. Recent studies have argued that Multidimensional Knapsack Problems (MKPs) are examples of such cases. This paper extends these studies with an extensive comparison of various LTGA variants for the MKP. Using a well-known GA as reference, we analyzed the difficulties faced by the LTGA and explained why its linkage-tree model is not of much help to solve the problem. The results have shown that the LTGA was not able to outperform the GA and performed very similarly to a LTGA using random linkage-models. Further analysis of the linkage-trees, grounded on the knapsack-core concept, enabled interesting conclusions about the reason that linkage-learning did not provide useful information to solve MKPs in the settings used for the experiments.

        "description": "Artificial chromosomes with genetic algorithm (ACGA) is one of the latest versions of the estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). This algorithm has already been applied successfully to solve different kinds of scheduling problems. However, due to the fact that its probabilistic model does not consider variable interactions, ACGA may not perform well in some scheduling problems, particularly if sequence dependent setup times are considered. This is due to the fact that the previous job will influence the processing time of the next job. Simply capturing ordinal information from the parental distribution is not sufficient for a probabilistic model. As a result, this paper proposes a bi-variate probabilistic model to add into the ACGA. This new algorithm is called the ACGA2 and is used to solve single machine scheduling problems with sequence-dependent setup times in a common due-date environment. A theoretical analysis is given in this paper. Some heuristics and local search algorithm variable neighborhood search (VNS) are also employed in the ACGA2. The results indicate that the average error ratio of this ACGA2 is half the error ratio of the ACGA. In addition, when ACGA2 is applied in combination with other heuristic methods and VNS, the hybrid algorithm achieves optimal solution quality in comparison with other algorithms in the literature. Thus, the proposed algorithms are effective for solving the scheduling problems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.",

        "description": "We consider the problem of high dimensional black-box optimisation via Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDA). The Gaussian distribution is commonly used as a search operator in most of the EDA methods. However there are indications in the literature that heavy tailed distributions may perform better due to their higher exploration capabilities. Univariate heavy tailed distributions were already proposed for high dimensional problems. In 2D problems it has been reported that a multivariate heavy tailed (such as Cauchy) search distribution is able to blend together the strengths of multivariate modelling with a high exploration power. In this paper, we study whether a similar scheme would work well in high dimensional search problems. To get around of the difficulty of multivariate model building in high dimensions we employ a recently proposed random projections (RP) ensemble based approach which we modify to get samples from a multivariate Cauchy using the scale-mixture representation of the Cauchy distribution. Our experiments show that the resulting RP-based multivariate Cauchy EDA consistently improves on the performance of the univariate Cauchy search distribution. However, intriguingly, the RP-based multivariate Gaussian EDA has the best performance among these methods. It appears that the highly explorative nature of the multivariate Cauchy sampling is exacerbated in high dimensional search spaces and the population based search loses its focus and effectiveness as a result. Finally, we present an idea to increase exploration while maintaining exploitation and focus by using the RP-based multivariate Gaussian EDA in which the RP matrices are drawn with i.i.d. heavy tailed entries. This achieves improved performance and is competitive with the state of the art.",
