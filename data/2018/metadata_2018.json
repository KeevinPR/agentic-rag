        "description": "With the increasing level of mass-customization and globalization of competition, environmentally friendly production scheduling for distributed manufacturing considering customer satisfaction has received growing attention. Meanwhile, uncertain scheduling is becoming a force to be considered within intelligent manufacturing industries. However, little research has been found that surveyed the uncertain distributed scheduling considering both energy consumption and customer satisfaction. In this article, the fuzzy distributed hybrid flow-shop scheduling problem considering on-time delivery (FDHFSP-OTD) is addressed, and a 3-D estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) with reinforcement learning (RL) is proposed to minimize the makespan and total energy consumption while maximizing delivery accuracy. First, two heuristics and a random method are designed and used cooperatively for initialization. Next, an EDA with a 3-D probability matrix is innovated to generate offspring. Then, a biased decoding method based on Q-learning is proposed to adjust the direction of evolution self-adaptively. Moreover, a local intensification strategy is employed for further enhancement of elite solutions. The effect of major parameters is analyzed and the best combination of values is determined through extensive experiments. The numerical results prove the effectiveness of each specially designed strategy and method, and the comparisons with existing algorithms demonstrate the high-potential of the 3D-EDA/RL in solving the FDHFSP-OTD.",

        "description": "This article studies an operation optimization problem in a steelmaking process. Shortly before the tapping of molten steel from the basic oxygen furnace (BOF), end-point control measures are applied to achieve the required final molten steel quality. While it is difficult to build an exact mathematical model for this process, the control inputs and the corresponding outputs are available by collecting production data. We build a data-driven model for the process. To optimize the control parameters, an improved estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) is developed using a probabilistic model comprising different distributions. A resampling mechanism is incorporated into the EDA to guide the new population to a broader and more promising area when the search becomes ineffective. To further enhance the solution quality, we add a local improvement to update the current best individual through simplified gravitational search and information learning. Experiments are conducted using real data from a BOF steelmaking process. The results show that the algorithm can help to achieve the specified molten steel quality. To evaluate the proposed algorithm as a general optimization algorithm, we test it on some complex benchmark functions. The results illustrate that it outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms across a wide range of problems.",

        "description": "The two-stage flow-shop scheduling problem investigated in this work aims minimize the resource consumption of non-identical job sizes. The flow shop consists of two batch-processing machines (BPMs): a parallel batch BPM and a sequential BPM. The makespan and resource consumption are considered together in this study, the makespan is the constraint condition, and the resource consumption is the objective. A copula-based Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (cEDA) is used to solve the problem. In this study, the individuals are coded by the allocated resource sequences of all jobs in two machines, and the convex resource consumption function is adopted to simulate the relationship between the processing time of the jobs and the resources allocated to the jobs. A Gaussian distribution is adopted as the marginal probabilistic distribution of all the components. The proposed copula function C-1 assumes independence among the components, whereas the Clayton copula function C-2 assumes that all components are interrelated and introduced for comparison. The computational experiments and comparisons verify the effectiveness of the proposed cEDA. In addition, the copula functions C-1 and C-2 adopted in the proposed cEDA approach are compared.

The Probabilistic Graphic Model (PGM) of HMOBEDA expands the possibilities for exploration as it provides the joint probability of decision variables, objectives, and configuration parameters of an embedded local search. This work investigates different sampling mechanisms of HMOBEDA, applying the considered approaches to two different combinatorial MaOPs. Moreover, the paper provides a broad set of statistical analyses on its PGM model. These analyses have been carried out to evaluate how the interactions among variables, objectives and local search parameters are captured by the model and how information collected from different runs can be aggregated and explored in a Probabilistic Pareto Front. In experiments, two variants of HMOBEDA are compared with the original version, each one with a different set of evidences fixed during the sampling process. Results for instances of multi-objective knapsack problem with 2-5 and 8 objectives show that the best variant outperforms the original HMOBEDA in terms of convergence and diversity in the solution set. This best variant is then compared with five state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms using the knapsack problem instances as well as a set of MNK-landscape instances with 2, 3, 5 and 8 objectives. HMOBEDA outperforms all of them.",

        "description": "This paper proposes a distance-based two-stage energy management strategy for power-split plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). One stage is for long-term optimization and the other is for short-term adaptation to actual traffic conditions. Energy consumption in PHEVs depends on the characteristics of the drivetrain as well as the operating conditions such as power demands and their split. Thus, prior to departure, the operating conditions for a whole trip are optimized for the drivetrain characteristics and trip information, which generates optimal speed and state-of-charge profiles. While driving, the operating conditions are adapted to current traffic conditions for a short horizon on the basis of long-term optimization results. In consideration of the changeability of traffic conditions, the proposed energy management strategy is performed in a distance domain, which localizes the effects of changes in traffic conditions on the long-term optimization results. Therefore, this distance-based two-stage strategy improves the balance between the optimality and the real-time computing time, which is suitable for online management. A model for the propulsion system in a PHEV and the energy management strategy were formulated in a distance domain. An estimation of distribution algorithm was used for long-term optimization and local adaptation.",

        "description": "Understanding how the time complexity of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) depend on their parameter settings and characteristics of fitness landscapes is a fundamental problem in evolutionary computation. Most rigorous results were derived using a handful of key analytic techniques, including drift analysis. However, since few of these techniques apply effortlessly to population-based EAs, most time complexity results concern simple EAs, such as the (1+1) EA. We present the level-based theorem, a new technique tailored to population-based processes. It applies to any nonelitist process where offspring are sampled independently from a distribution depending only on the current population. Given conditions on this distribution, our technique provides upper bounds on the expected time until the process reaches a target state. The technique is demonstrated on pseudo-Boolean functions, the sorting problem, and approximation of optimal solutions in combinatorial optimization. The conditions of the theorem are often straightforward to verify, even for genetic algorithms and estimation of distribution algorithms which were considered highly nontrivial to analyze. The proofs for the example applications are available in the supplementary materials. Finally, we prove that the theorem is nearly optimal for the processes considered. Given the information the theorem requires about the process, a much tighter bound cannot be proved.",

        "description": "The performance of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms deteriorates appreciably in solving many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs) which encompass more than three objectives. One of the known rationales is the loss of selection pressure which leads to the selected parents not generating promising offspring toward Pareto-optimal front (PF) with diversity. Estimation of distribution algorithms sample new solutions with a probabilistic model built from the statistics extracting over the existing solutions so as to mitigate the adverse impact of genetic operators. In this paper, an improved regularity-based estimation of distribution algorithm is proposed to effectively tackle unconstrained MaOPs. In the proposed algorithm, diversity repairing mechanism is utilized to mend the areas, where need nondominated solutions with a closer proximity to the PF. Then favorable solutions are generated by the model built from the regularity of the solutions surrounding a group of representatives. These two steps collectively enhance the selection pressure which gives rise to the superior convergence of the proposed algorithm. In addition, dimension reduction technique is employed in the decision space to speed up the estimation search of the proposed algorithm. Finally, by assigning the Pareto-optimal solutions to the uniformly distributed reference vectors, a set of solutions with excellent diversity and convergence is obtained. To measure the performance, NSGA-III, GrEA, MOEA/D, HypE, MBN-EDA, and RM-MEDA are selected to perform comparison experiments over DTLZ and DTLZ(-) test suites with 3-, 5-, 8-, 10-, and 15-objective. Experimental results quantified by the selected performance metrics reveal that the proposed algorithm shows considerable competitiveness in addressing unconstrained MaOPs.",

        "description": "Both differential evolution (DE) and estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) are popular and effective evolutionary algorithms (EM) in solving global optimization problems. The two algorithms utilize different kinds of information for generating offspring solutions. In the former, the mutation and crossover operators use the individual information to create trial solutions, while in the later, a probabilistic model is built for sampling new trial solutions, which extracts the population distribution information. It is therefore natural to make use of both kinds of information for generating solutions. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that hybridizes DE and EDA, named as DE/GM, which utilizes both DE crossover/mutation operators and a Gaussian probabilistic model based operator for offspring generation. The basic idea is to generate some of trial solutions by the EDA operator, and to generate the rest by the DE operator. To validate the performance of DE/GM, a test suite of 13 benchmark functions is employed, and the experimental results suggest that DE/GM is promising.",

In FRM-MEDA, the clustering process is removed from the original algorithm and the full variate Gaussian model (FGM) is introduced to keep the population diversity and make up the loss of the performance caused by removing the clustering process. Meanwhile, the introduction of FGM makes the FRM-MEDA faster and more stable when solving all the test instances. In addition, variable variance of FGM is presented to enhance the exploring ability of FRM-MEDA.

        "description": "The flexible job-shop environments have become increasingly significant because of rapid improvements on shop floors such as production technologies, manufacturing processes and systems. Several real manufacturing and service companies have had to use alternative machines or processes for each operation and the availability of alternative process plans for each job in order to achieve good performance on the shop floor where conflicting objectives are common, e.g. the overall completion time for all jobs and the workload of the most loaded machine. In this paper, we propose a Pareto approach based on the hybridization of an estimation of distribution algorithm and the Mallows distribution in order to build better sequences for flexible job-shop scheduling problems with process plan flexibility and to solve conflicting objectives. This hybrid approach exploits the Pareto-front information used as an input parameter in the Mallows distribution. Various instances and numerical experiments are presented to illustrate that shop floor performance can be noticeably improved using the proposed approach.

To achieve a rapid and effective algorithm of optimized configuration for distributed generation, a hybrid approach combined with Bayesian statistical-inference and distribution estimation is proposed. Specifically, a probability distribution estimation model based on the theory of Bayesian inference is established, then a posteriori probability model with the prior distribution and the conditional distribution is generated, and new individual generators are formed into a dominant group. The information of each individual of this dominant group is used to update the probability model and the updated posteriori probability is used for sampling until the optimal solution is obtained.

        "description": "This article tackles the Distribution Network Expansion Planning (DNEP) problem that has to be solved by distribution network operators to decide which, where, and/or when enhancements to electricity networks should be introduced to satisfy the future power demands. Because of many real-world details involved, the structure of the problem is not exploited easily using mathematical programming techniques, for which reason we consider solving this problem with evolutionary algorithms (EAs). We compare three types of EAs for optimizing expansion plans: the classic genetic algorithm (GA), the estimation-of-distribution algorithm (EDA), and the Gene-pool Optimal Mixing Evolutionary Algorithm (GOMEA). Not fully knowing the structure of the problem, we study the effect of linkage learning through the use of three linkage models: univariate, marginal product, and linkage tree. We furthermore experiment with the impact of incorporating different levels of problem-specific knowledge in the variation operators. Experiments show that the use of problem-specific variation operators is far more important for the classic GA to find high-quality solutions. In all EAs, the marginal product model and its linkage learning procedure have difficulty in capturing and exploiting the DNEP problem structure. GOMEA, especially when combined with the linkage tree structure, is found to have the most robust performance by far, even when an out-of-the-box variant is used that does not exploit problem-specific knowledge. Based on experiments, we suggest that when selecting optimization algorithms for power system expansion planning problems, EAs that have the ability to effectively model and efficiently exploit problem structures, such as GOMEA, should be given priority, especially in the case of black-box or grey-box optimization.",

        "description": "One of the major distinguishing features of the dynamic multiobjective optimization problems (DMOPs) is that optimization objectives will change over time, thus tracking the varying Pareto-optimal front becomes a challenge. One of the promising solutions is reusing \"experiences\" to construct a prediction model via statistical machine learning approaches. However, most existing methods neglect the nonindependent and identically distributed nature of data to construct the prediction model. In this paper, we propose an algorithmic framework, called transfer learning-based dynamic multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (EA), which integrates transfer learning and population-based EAs to solve the DMOPs. This approach exploits the transfer learning technique as a tool to generate an effective initial population pool via reusing past experience to speed up the evolutionary process, and at the same time any population-based multiobjective algorithms can benefit from this integration without any extensive modifications. To verify this idea, we incorporate the proposed approach into the development of three well-known EAs, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II, multiobjective particle swarm optimization, and the regularity model-based multiobjective estimation of distribution algorithm. We employ 12 benchmark functions to test these algorithms as well as compare them with some chosen state-of-the-art designs.

        "description": "This paper proposes a new multi-objective optimization problem to find trade-offs in deployment of phasor measurement units (PMUs) and intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) for state estimation in active distribution networks. A new hybrid estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) has been used to find the optimal number and location of measurement devices, such as PMU and IED, for accurate state estimation. The objective functions to be minimized in this optimization problem are the total cost of PMUs and IEDs, and the root mean square value of state estimation error. As the objectives are conflicting in nature, a multi-objective Pareto-based nondominated sorting (NDS) EDA algorithm is proposed. Moreover, to improve the local searching capability of the traditional EDA algorithm, the interior point method (IPM) is hybridized with EDA to get a near-global optimal solution. The hybridization of EDA with IPM brings a higher degree of balance between the exploration and exploitation capability of the traditional EDA during the search process. Furthermore, the random variation in loads and generations is also considered to check the reliability of the proposed meter placement technique. The viability of the proposed algorithm has been tested on the IEEE 69-bus system and Indian 85-bus system to validate the results.

        "description": "A Bayesian network is a promising probabilistic model to represent causal relations between nodes (random variables). One of the major research issue in a Bayesian network is how to infer causal relations from a dataset by constructing better heuristic learning algorithms. Many kinds of approaches were so far introduced, and estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) are one of the promising causal discovery algorithms. However, the performance of EDAs is considerably dependent on the quality of the first population because new individuals are reproduced from the previous populations. In this paper, we introduce a new initialization method for EDAs that extracts promising candidate causal relations based on causal scores. Then, we used the promising relations to construct a better first population and to reproduce better individuals until the learning algorithm is terminated. Experimental results show that EDAs infer a more number of correct causal relations when promising relations were used in EDA based structure learning. It means that the performance of EDAs can be improved by providing better local search space, and it was the promising relations in this paper.",

        "description": "Traditional Gaussian estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) are confronted with issues that the variable variances decrease fast and the main search direction tends to become perpendicular to the improvement direction of the fitness function, which reduces the search efficiency of Gaussian EDAs (GEDAs) and makes them subject to premature convergence. In this paper, a novel anisotropic adaptive variance scaling (AAVS) technique is proposed to improve the performance of traditional GEDAs and a new GEDA variant named AAVS-EDA is developed. The advantages of AAVS over the existing variance scaling strategies lie in its ability for tuning the variances and main search direction of GEDA simultaneously, which are achieved by anisotropically scaling the variances along different eigendirections based on corresponding landscape characteristics captured by a simple topology -based detection method. Besides, AAVS-EDA also adopts an auxiliary global monitor to ensure its convergence by shrinking all the variances if no improvement is achieved in a generation. The evaluation results on 30 benchmark functions of CEC2014 test suite demonstrate that AAVS-EDA possesses stronger global optimization efficiency than traditional GEDAs. The comparison with other state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms also shows that AAVS-EDA is efficient and competitive. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

Realtime information can be obtained by using phasor measurement units (PMUs) facilitating the realtime synchronized observations of voltage and current phasors at buses being monitored. Different optimization formulations including but not limited to linear, integer, stochastic, mixed integer and NP hard combinatorial optimization have been used to manipulate these phasor measurements for the detection of line outages. Single and double line outages can be addressed using combinatorial optimization but these are infeasible to apply for the detection of multiple line outages as the increased number of lines increases computational complexity. To alleviate the exponentially increased complexities of these combinatorial optimization problems, while investigating for multiple line outage, evolutionary, Estimation of Distribution Algorithm is used. This method gives near optimal solution in which computational complexity and time is reduced efficiently. In this paper we scrutinize the use of phasor angle measurements to detect multiple power line outages. The proposed EDA is compared with binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) algorithm, adaptive BPSO and genetic algorithm (GA) in terms of line outage detection performance, fitness convergence w.r.t. iterations and time consumption.

Notable features of the proposed algorithm include the importance sampling, nonparametric density estimation, probabilistic prediction, and a domain adaptation technique seamlessly unified under an innovative framework. The design takes full advantage of the powerful Monte-Carlo method and transfer learning technique. This kind of combination will help the proposed algorithm to maintain a delicate exploration exploitation trade-off from temporal and spatial perspectives. At the same time, it will help the proposed algorithm to overcome the shortcomings caused by transfer learning, specifically, the loss of the diversity. After proving convergence and analyzing the computational complexity of the DANE-EDA, we compare the proposed method with nine EDAs or dynamic multi-objective optimization algorithms on twelve different test instances.

The feasibility of individuals is checked and guaranteed by a highly permissiveness deadlock controller. A feasible individual is interpreted into a deadlock-free schedule while the infeasible ones are amended. The probabilistic model in EDA is constructed via a voting procedure. An offspring individual is then produced based on the model from a seed individual, and the set of seed individuals is extracted by a roulette method from the current population. The longest common subsequence is also embedded into the probabilistic model for mining good genes. A modified variable neighborhood search is applied on offspring individuals to obtain better solutions in their neighbors and hence to improve EDA's performance. Computational results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms all the existing ones on benchmark examples for the studied problem.

The objective functions to be minimised are, the total network configuration cost, the average relative percentage error of bus voltage magnitude and angle estimates. As the objectives are conflicting in nature, a multi-objective Pareto-based non-dominated sorting EDA has been proposed in this study. Moreover, due to poor exploitation capability of the EDA, it is hybridised with IPM to improve its local searching ability in the search space. The hybridisation of EDA and IPM brings a higher degree of balance between the exploration and exploitation capability of the algorithm during the search process. Furthermore, the loads and generators are treated as stochastic variable and the impact of different type of distributed generations on SE performance has also been investigated. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is tested on PG&amp;E 69-bus system and Indian 85-bus radial distribution network.

To ensure a minimum amount of variation in a population, EDP adds random noise to the probabilities of random variables.

The results indicate that the complexity of the EDP model is high since the model is overfitting the parent solutions when no additional noise is being used. Adding only a low amount of noise leads to a strong bias towards small trees. The bias gets stronger with an increased amount of noise.

This NP-hard problem has been successfully handled by many Evolutionary Computation techniques with promising results. Estimation of Distribution has shown its initial promise in solving fully automated service composition, and its success strongly relies on distribution models and sampling techniques. Our recently published work proposed a Node Histogram-Based approach to fully automated service composition. However, many services presented in sampled optimized queues does not contribute to decoded solutions of the queue. Therefore, efforts should be made to focus on learning distributions of component services in solutions. Consequently, we aim to learn more suitable distributions considering services satisfying service dependency in the solutions and use the Edge Histogram Matrix to learn restricted sampled outcomes satisfying the dependency.

By combining a divide-and-conquer strategy and the classic evolutionary algorithms (EA) like genetic algorithm (GA), CC has shown promising performance in many fields. As a family of EAs, the estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) is good at search diversity maintenance, but its capability in solving large-scale problems has not been fully explored. In this paper, we aim to propose a new estimation of distribution algorithm with the cooperative co-evolution framework (EDACC). The proposed EDACC has the following features. (1) The differential grouping (DG) strategy is applied for variable decomposition. (2) A combination of the Gaussian and Cauchy distributions are adopted to generate offspring. (3) A local search method is performed in promising domains to accelerate the search.

Based on analyzing multiple moving vehicles across multiple frames, the Canny edge detector and Hough transform are first adopted to obtain orthogonal horizontal vanishing points pairs, from which corresponding vertical vanishing points are derived. Next, mean shift clustering and Laplace linear regression are employed to deal with noise and outliers during estimation of vanishing points. To overcome the unreliable estimation issues of orthogonal vanishing points pairs, we further utilize the projective line segments obtained from 3-D vehicle model to create more reliable pairs and iteratively improve the calibration results. Finally, the estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) is also applied to relax the assumptions made on camera parameters and the moving trajectories of vehicles during the iterations. Experimental results on different datasets prove the feasibility of our proposed scheme.",

In any of the previous cases, the behavior of the EDA is somehow denaturalized, since the sampled set does not follow the probability distribution estimated at that step. In this work, we present a general method to approach constrained combinatorial optimization problems by means of EDAs. This consists of developing distance-based exponential probability models defined exclusively on the set of feasible solutions.

These requirements often cover functional parts (i.e., semantic matchmaking of services' inputs and outputs) and nonfunctional parts (i.e., Quality of Service). Service composition is an NP-hard problem. Evolutionary Computation (EC) techniques have been successfully proposed for finding solutions with near-optimal Quality of Semantic Matchmaking (QoSM) and/or Quality of Service (QoS) using knowledge of promising solutions. Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) has been applied to semi-automated QoS-aware service composition, since it is capable of extracting knowledge of good solutions into a explicit probabilistic model. However, existing works do not support extracting knowledge for fully automated service composition that does not obeying a given workflow.

Among all the optimization algorithms, estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) attracts more attention because of its simple principle and special mechanism. Unfortunately, it loses feasibility and effectiveness in multimodal problems because of premature convergence and the missing of multimodality-specific mechanism. So niching is adopted to help EDA to locate diverse promising solution regions in multimodal optimization. However, many of the niching techniques are either sensitive to parameters or cost a number of fitness evaluations. In this paper a new proposed fast cooperative clustering strategy is adopted to offer improved assistance for locating multiple optima based on both decision and target space information. Taking the advantage of EDA in preserving high diversity, this paper proposes a cooperative clustering based multimodal EDA (CMEDA). Integrated with new proposed cooperative clustering strategy, multimodal problems are divided into certain promising regions automatically. Then each cluster independently runs a separate optimizer in parallel to search promising regions carefully, which can avoid premature convergence greatly. Based on the results of clustering, the value of key parameter is determined by statistic information but not artificial setting. Then a balance between exploration and exploitation is achieved. Experimental results indicate that the proposed technique is an effective and efficient algorithm which can not only explores and exploits the promising regions in the search space effectively but also obtain the global optima superior to the typical multimodal EDA (MEDA).",

In order to obtain the dispatching strategy that can better respond to changes in road conditions during the whole dispatching process, the real-time and time-dependent link travel speeds are fused, and a time-dependent polygonal-shaped link travel speed function is set up to simulate the predictable changes in road conditions. Response times, accident severity, and accident time windows are taken as key factors to build an emergency vehicle dispatching model integrating dynamic emergency vehicle routing and selection. For the unpredictable changes in road conditions caused by accidents, the dispatching strategy is adjusted based on the real-time link travel speed. In order to solve the dynamic emergency vehicle dispatching model, an improved shuffled frog leaping algorithm (ISFLA) is proposed. The global search of the improved algorithm uses the probability model of estimation of distribution algorithm to avoid the partial optimal solution. Based on the Beijing expressway network, the efficacy of the model and the improved algorithm were tested from three aspects. The results have shown the following: (1) Compared with SFLA, the optimization performance of ISFLA is getting better and better with the increase of the number of decision variables. When the possible emergency vehicle selection strategies are 815, the objective function value of optimal selection strategies obtained by the base algorithm is 210.10% larger than that of ISFLA. (2) The prediction error of the travel speed affects the accuracy of the initial emergency vehicle dispatching. The prediction error of +/- 10 can basically meet the requirements of the initial dispatching. (3) The adjustment of emergency vehicle dispatching strategy can successfully bypassed road sections affected by accidents and shorten the response time.",

The Alopex-based evolutionary algorithm (AEA) possesses the basic characteristics of heuristic search algorithms but is lacking in adequate information about the fitness landscape of the input domain, reducing the convergence speed. To improve the performance of AEA, the Gaussian copula estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) is embedded into the original AEA in this paper. With the help of Gaussian copula EDA, precise probability models are built utilising the best solutions, which can increase the convergence speed, and at the same time, keep the population diversity as much as possible. The simulation results on the benchmark functions and the application to the Butterworth filter design demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, compared with several other EAs.",

        "description": "Efficient power line outage identification is an important step which ensures reliable and smooth operation of smart grids. The problem of multiple line outage detection (MLOD) is formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem and known to be NP-hard. Such a problem is optimally solvable with the help of an exhaustive evaluation of all possible combinations of lines in outage. However, the size of search space is exponential with the number of power lines in the grid, which makes exhaustive search infeasible for practical sized smart grids. A number of published works on MLOD are limited to identify a small, constant number of lines outages, usually known to the algorithm in advanced. This paper applies the Bayesian approach to solve the MLOD problem in linear time. In particular, this paper proposes a low complexity estimation of outage detection algorithm, based on the classical estimation of distribution algorithm. Thanks to an efficient thresholding routine, the proposed solution avoids the premature convergence and is able to identify any arbitrary number (combination) of line outages. The proposed solution is validated against the IEEE-14 and 57 bus systems with several random line outage combinations. Two performance metrics, namely, success generation ratio and percentage improvement have been introduced in this paper, which quantify the accuracy as well as convergence speed of proposed solution. The comparison results demonstrate that the proposed solution is computationally efficient and outperforms a number of classical meta-heuristics.",

These are stochastic optimization strategies devised to capture complex interactions among problem variables by learning the probabilistic model of candidate solutions and its sampling to generate the next population. From the broad spectrum of EDAs that use multivariate models, two representative procedures are selected that significantly differ in the methods used for learning and sampling those models.

Recently, a first study that used basic Gaussian EDAs indicated that typically suggested algorithmic parameter settings do not necessarily transfer well to the CiaS problem. In this article, we consider also AMaLGaM, an enhanced Gaussian EDA, as well as arguably the most powerful real-valued black-box optimization algorithm to date, CMA-ES, which can also be seen as a further enhanced Gaussian EDA. We study whether the well-known performance on typical benchmark problems extends to the CiaS problem. We find that although the enhancements over a basic Gaussian EDA result in superior performance, the further efficiency enhancements in CMA-ES are not highly impactful. Instead, the most impactful features are how constraint handling is performed, how large the population size is, whether a full covariance matrix is used and whether restart techniques are used. We further show that a previously published version of AMaLGaM that does not require the user to set the the population size parameter is capable of solving the problem and we derive the scalability of the required number of function evaluations to solve the problem up to 99.99 % of the known optimal value for up to 30 circles.",

        "description": "Although some of the earliest Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) utilized bivariate marginal distribution models, up to now, all discrete bivariate EDAs had one serious limitation: they were constrained to exploiting only a limited O(d) subset out of all possible bivariate dependencies. As a first we present a family of discrete bivariate EDAs that can learn and exploit all dependencies between variables, and yet have the same run-time complexity as their more limited counterparts. This family of algorithms, which we label DICE (DIscrete Correlated Estimation of distribution algorithms), is rigorously based on sound statistical principles, and particularly on a modelling technique from statistical physics: dichotomised multivariate Gaussian distributions. Initially (Lane et al. in European Conference on the Applications of Evolutionary Computation, Springer, 1999), DICE was trialled on a suite of combinatorial optimization problems over binary search spaces. Our proposed dichotomised Gaussian (DG) model in DICE significantly outperformed existing discrete bivariate EDAs; crucially, the performance gap increasingly widened as dimensionality of the problems increased. In this comprehensive treatment, we generalise DICE by successfully extending it to multary search spaces that also allow for categorical variables. Because correlation is not wholly meaningful for categorical variables, interactions between such variables cannot be fully modelled by correlation-based approaches such as in the original formulation of DICE. Therefore, here we extend our original DG model to deal with such situations. We test DICE on a challenging test suite of combinatorial optimization problems, which are defined mostly on multary search spaces. While the two versions of DICE outperform each other on different problem instances, they both outperform all the state-of-the-art bivariate EDAs on almost all of the problem instances. This further illustrates that these innovative DICE methods constitute a significant step change in the domain of discrete bivariate EDAs.",

Moreover, in order to scrutinize the probabilistic graphic model obtained by mBOA, the Pareto front is examined according to a probabilistic view. The fitness landscape study shows that mBOA is moderately or loosely influenced by some problem features, according to a simple and a multiple linear regression model, which is being proposed to predict the algorithms performance in terms of the estimated runtime.

        "description": "In the theory community of evolutionary computation, linear pseudo-boolean functions are often regarded as easy problems since all of them can be optimized in expected time O(n logn) by simple unbiased algorithms. However, results from genetic algorithms and estimation-of-distribution algorithms indicate that these algorithms treat different linear functions differently. More precisely, an effect called \"domino convergence\" is described in the literature, which means that bits of large weight in the linear function are optimized earlier than bits of low weight. Hence, different linear functions may lead to rather different expected optimization times.|The present paper conducts a study of domino convergence. By rigorous runtime analyses, it is shown that domino convergence is mostly a consequence of the crossover underlying genetic algorithms and EDAs. Here a performance gap of order O(n/logn) between different linear functions is proved. In simple mutationonly EAs the effect of domino convergence is much less pronounced, with the typical performance gap being logarithmic in the population size. The effect disappears when population size 1 is used and the algorithm is reduced to hillclimbing. Different selection mechanisms, including cut and tournament selection are investigated and their impact on domino convergence is analyzed.",

However, these important relationships have not been deeply investigated in terms of Estimation of Distribution algorithms (EDAs). In a preliminary research, we focused on UMDA, a simple EDA that uses univariate Gaussian factorizations. Experimental results confirm that the choice of the selection method can provoke probabilistic modeling to be more effective for some classes of functions. Motivated by these results, this study is extended by evaluating several variants of selection strategies and probabilistic modeling approaches. The aim is to detect possible interactions between these two important components of evolutionary algorithms. Specifically, we use the selection strategies as defined for NSGA2, SPEA2, and IBEA algorithms, and the probabilistic models implemented as part of UMDA and CMA-ES, and a simple crossover operator (SBX). The recently introduced COCO framework comprising 55 bi-objective functions is used as the benchmark for the analysis. The results show that probabilistic modeling has an advantage over the classical genetic operator regardless of the selection method applied. Nevertheless, the results also show that some selection methods have a better performance when applied together with EDAs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

Here, we investigate the use of Evolutionary Algorithms to design DM and two of their generalizations, namely Resolvable Matrices (RM) and Almost Disjunct Matrices (ADM). After discussing the basic encoding used to represent the candidate solutions of our optimization problems, we define three fitness functions, each measuring the deviation of a generic binary matrix from being respectively a DM, an RM or an ADM. Next, we employ Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDA), Genetic Algorithms (GA), and Genetic Programming (GP) to optimize these fitness functions. The results show that GP achieves the best performances among the three heuristics, converging to an optimal solution on a wider range of problem instances. Although these results do not match those obtained by other state-of-the-art methods in the literature, we argue that our heuristic approach can generate solutions that are not expressible by currently known algebraic techniques, and sketch some possible ideas to further improve its performance.",

The results of the evolutionary descriptor are compared with those obtained by using methods based on the Hessian matrix, Gaussian filters and top-hat operator. The proposed method obtained the highest performance in terms of the area (A(z)) under the ROC curve (A(z) = 0.9661) compared with five stateof- the-art vessel detection methods using a training set of 50 angiograms and A(z) = 0.9532 with an independent test set of 50 angiograms.

The model used in GOMEA is aimed at modeling the dependency structure between problem variables, so as to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of variation.

In this article, we consider also AMaLGaM, an enhanced Gaussian EDA, as well as arguably the most powerful real-valued black-box optimization algorithm to date, CMA-ES, which can also be seen as a further enhanced Gaussian EDA. We study whether the well-known performance on typical benchmark problems extends to the CiaS problem. We find that although the enhancements over a basic Gaussian EDA result in superior performance, the further efficiency enhancements in CMA-ES are not highly impactful. Instead, the most impactful features are how constraint handling is performed, how large the population size is, whether a full covariance matrix is used and whether restart techniques are used. We further show that a previously published version of AMaLGaM that does not require the user to set the the population size parameter is capable of solving the problem and we derive the scalability of the required number of function evaluations to solve the problem up to 99.99 % of the known optimal value for up to 30 circles.",

        "description": "Although some of the earliest Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) utilized bivariate marginal distribution models, up to now, all discrete bivariate EDAs had one serious limitation: they were constrained to exploiting only a limited O(d) subset out of all possible bivariate dependencies. As a first we present a family of discrete bivariate EDAs that can learn and exploit all dependencies between variables, and yet have the same run-time complexity as their more limited counterparts. This family of algorithms, which we label DICE (DIscrete Correlated Estimation of distribution algorithms), is rigorously based on sound statistical principles, and particularly on a modelling technique from statistical physics: dichotomised multivariate Gaussian distributions. Initially (Lane et al. in European Conference on the Applications of Evolutionary Computation, Springer, 1999), DICE was trialled on a suite of combinatorial optimization problems over binary search spaces. Our proposed dichotomised Gaussian (DG) model in DICE significantly outperformed existing discrete bivariate EDAs; crucially, the performance gap increasingly widened as dimensionality of the problems increased. In this comprehensive treatment, we generalise DICE by successfully extending it to multary search spaces that also allow for categorical variables. Because correlation is not wholly meaningful for categorical variables, interactions between such variables cannot be fully modelled by correlation-based approaches such as in the original formulation of DICE. Therefore, here we extend our original DG model to deal with such situations. We test DICE on a challenging test suite of combinatorial optimization problems, which are defined mostly on multary search spaces. While the two versions of DICE outperform each other on different problem instances, they both outperform all the state-of-the-art bivariate EDAs on almost all of the problem instances. This further illustrates that these innovative DICE methods constitute a significant step change in the domain of discrete bivariate EDAs.",

We also compare the results of mBOA with those provided by NSGA-III through the analysis of their estimated runtime necessary to identify an approximation of the Pareto front. Moreover, in order to scrutinize the probabilistic graphic model obtained by mBOA, the Pareto front is examined according to a probabilistic view. The fitness landscape study shows that mBOA is moderately or loosely influenced by some problem features, according to a simple and a multiple linear regression model, which is being proposed to predict the algorithms performance in terms of the estimated runtime. Besides, we conclude that the analysis of the probabilistic graphic model produced at the end of evolution can be useful to understand the convergence and diversity performances of the proposed approach.",

        "description": "In the theory community of evolutionary computation, linear pseudo-boolean functions are often regarded as easy problems since all of them can be optimized in expected time O(n logn) by simple unbiased algorithms. However, results from genetic algorithms and estimation-of-distribution algorithms indicate that these algorithms treat different linear functions differently. More precisely, an effect called \"domino convergence\" is described in the literature, which means that bits of large weight in the linear function are optimized earlier than bits of low weight. Hence, different linear functions may lead to rather different expected optimization times.|The present paper conducts a study of domino convergence. By rigorous runtime analyses, it is shown that domino convergence is mostly a consequence of the crossover underlying genetic algorithms and EDAs. Here a performance gap of order O(n/logn) between different linear functions is proved. In simple mutationonly EAs the effect of domino convergence is much less pronounced, with the typical performance gap being logarithmic in the population size. The effect disappears when population size 1 is used and the algorithm is reduced to hillclimbing. Different selection mechanisms, including cut and tournament selection are investigated and their impact on domino convergence is analyzed.",

However, these important relationships have not been deeply investigated in terms of Estimation of Distribution algorithms (EDAs). In a preliminary research, we focused on UMDA, a simple EDA that uses univariate Gaussian factorizations. Experimental results confirm that the choice of the selection method can provoke probabilistic modeling to be more effective for some classes of functions. Motivated by these results, this study is extended by evaluating several variants of selection strategies and probabilistic modeling approaches. The aim is to detect possible interactions between these two important components of evolutionary algorithms. Specifically, we use the selection strategies as defined for NSGA2, SPEA2, and IBEA algorithms, and the probabilistic models implemented as part of UMDA and CMA-ES, and a simple crossover operator (SBX). The recently introduced COCO framework comprising 55 bi-objective functions is used as the benchmark for the analysis. The results show that probabilistic modeling has an advantage over the classical genetic operator regardless of the selection method applied. Nevertheless, the results also show that some selection methods have a better performance when applied together with EDAs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

Traditionally, the methods used to construct DM leverage on error-correcting codes and other related algebraic techniques. Here, we investigate the use of Evolutionary Algorithms to design DM and two of their generalizations, namely Resolvable Matrices (RM) and Almost Disjunct Matrices (ADM). After discussing the basic encoding used to represent the candidate solutions of our optimization problems, we define three fitness functions, each measuring the deviation of a generic binary matrix from being respectively a DM, an RM or an ADM. Next, we employ Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDA), Genetic Algorithms (GA), and Genetic Programming (GP) to optimize these fitness functions. The results show that GP achieves the best performances among the three heuristics, converging to an optimal solution on a wider range of problem instances. Although these results do not match those obtained by other state-of-the-art methods in the literature, we argue that our heuristic approach can generate solutions that are not expressible by currently known algebraic techniques, and sketch some possible ideas to further improve its performance.",

The method consists of the vessel detection and segmentation steps. In the first step, the univariate marginal distribution algorithm (UMDA) is used to design the optimal binary template for detecting vessel-like structures by applying the morphological top-hat operator in the spatial image domain. The results of the evolutionary descriptor are compared with those obtained by using methods based on the Hessian matrix, Gaussian filters and top-hat operator. The proposed method obtained the highest performance in terms of the area (A(z)) under the ROC curve (A(z) = 0.9661) compared with five stateof- the-art vessel detection methods using a training set of 50 angiograms and A(z) = 0.9532 with an independent test set of 50 angiograms. In the second step, six thresholding methods are compared in terms of segmentation accuracy in order to classify vessel and nonvessel pixels from the evolutionary filter response. Finally, the experimental results for vessel segmentation with the proposed method provided an accuracy of 0.9580 with the test set of angiograms.",

Traditionally, the methods used to construct DM leverage on error-correcting codes and other related algebraic techniques. Here, we investigate the use of Evolutionary Algorithms to design DM and two of their generalizations, namely Resolvable Matrices (RM) and Almost Disjunct Matrices (ADM). After discussing the basic encoding used to represent the candidate solutions of our optimization problems, we define three fitness functions, each measuring the deviation of a generic binary matrix from being respectively a DM, an RM or an ADM. Next, we employ Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDA), Genetic Algorithms (GA), and Genetic Programming (GP) to optimize these fitness functions. The results show that GP achieves the best performances among the three heuristics, converging to an optimal solution on a wider range of problem instances. Although these results do not match those obtained by other state-of-the-art methods in the literature, we argue that our heuristic approach can generate solutions that are not expressible by currently known algebraic techniques, and sketch some possible ideas to further improve its performance.",

In the first step, the univariate marginal distribution algorithm (UMDA) is used to design the optimal binary template for detecting vessel-like structures by applying the morphological top-hat operator in the spatial image domain. The results of the evolutionary descriptor are compared with those obtained by using methods based on the Hessian matrix, Gaussian filters and top-hat operator. The proposed method obtained the highest performance in terms of the area (A(z)) under the ROC curve (A(z) = 0.9661) compared with five stateof- the-art vessel detection methods using a training set of 50 angiograms and A(z) = 0.9532 with an independent test set of 50 angiograms. In the second step, six thresholding methods are compared in terms of segmentation accuracy in order to classify vessel and nonvessel pixels from the evolutionary filter response.

Finding or learning the structure of BNs from data is an NP-hard problem. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been extensively used to automate the learning process. In this paper, we consider the use of the Gene-Pool Optimal Mixing Evolutionary Algorithm (GOMEA). GOMEA is a relatively new type of EA that belongs to the class of model-based EAs. The model used in GOMEA is aimed at modeling the dependency structure between problem variables, so as to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of variation. This paper shows that the excellent performance of GOMEA transfers from well-known academic benchmark problems to the specific case of learning BNs from data due to its model-building capacities and the potential to compute partial evaluations when learning BNs. On commonly-used datasets of varying size, we find that GOMEA outperforms standard algorithms such as Order-based search (OBS), as well as other EAs, such as Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and Estimation of Distribution algorithms (EDAs), even when efficient local search techniques are added.",

We consider the case of targeted attacks of this kind, and the use of detectors distributed over the area under threat as a protective countermeasure. Such detectors are non-fully reliable, and must be strategically placed in order to maximize the chances of detecting the attack, hence minimizing the expected number of casualties. To this end, different metaheuristic approaches based on local search and on population-based search (such as a hill climber, different Greedy randomized adaptive search procedures, an evolutionary algorithm and several estimation of distribution algorithms) are considered and benchmarked against a powerful greedy heuristic from the literature. We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation on synthetic instances featuring very diverse properties. Most metaheuristics outperform the greedy algorithm, and a hill-climber is shown to be superior to remaining approaches. This hill-climber is subsequently subject to a sensitivity analysis to determine which problem features make it stand above the greedy approach, and is finally deployed on a number of problem instances built after realistic scenarios, corroborating the good performance of the heuristic.",

In this paper, we focus on estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs).|Usually, research on EDAs mainly focuses on the design of probability models that either represent as best as possible the characteristics of the problem, or accurately fit the domain of the solutions. In this work, we propose implementing mixtures of probability models that permit the dynamic adjustment of the scope of the EDA. Particularly, we design a mixture model that combines two unimodal Thurstone family probability models: the Plackett-Luce model and the Bradley-Terry model. The first model tends to concentrate the probability around the mode, while the second spreads the probability more. Using a homogeneity measure on the population of solutions, we dynamically decide the ratio of solutions to sample from each model. Performed experiments on the linear ordering problem demonstrate that this research line is definitively promising.",

The recently introduced COCO framework comprising 55 bi-objective functions is used as the benchmark for the analysis. The results show that probabilistic modeling has an advantage over the classical genetic operator regardless of the selection method applied. Nevertheless, the results also show that some selection methods have a better performance when applied together with EDAs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "authors": "Knezevic, K, Picek, S, Leporati, A",
        "description": "Disjunct Matrices (DM) are a particular kind of binary matrices which have been especially applied to solve the Non-Adaptive Group Testing (NAGT) problem, where the task is to detect any configuration of t defectives out of a population of N items. Traditionally, the methods used to construct DM leverage on error-correcting codes and other related algebraic techniques. Here, we investigate the use of Evolutionary Algorithms to design DM and two of their generalizations, namely Resolvable Matrices (RM) and Almost Disjunct Matrices (ADM). After discussing the basic encoding used to represent the candidate solutions of our optimization problems, we define three fitness functions, each measuring the deviation of a generic binary matrix from being respectively a DM, an RM or an ADM. Next, we employ Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDA), Genetic Algorithms (GA), and Genetic Programming (GP) to optimize these fitness functions. The results show that GP achieves the best performances among the three heuristics, converging to an optimal solution on a wider range of problem instances. Although these results do not match those obtained by other state-of-the-art methods in the literature, we argue that our heuristic approach can generate solutions that are not expressible by currently known algebraic techniques, and sketch some possible ideas to further improve its performance.",

        "description": "To solve the moJSRP model, with the framework of proposed MoEDA, the probability model of the operation sequence is estimated firstly. For sampling the processing time of each operation with the Monte Carlo methods, allocation method is used to decide the operation sequence, and then the expected makespan and total tardiness of each sampling are evaluated. Subsequently, updating mechanism of the probability models is proposed according to the best solutions to obtain. Finally, for comparing with some existing algorithms by numerical experiments on the benchmark problems, we demonstrate the proposed effective estimation of distribution algorithm can obtain an acceptable solution in the aspects of schedule quality and computational efficiency.",

        "description": "This paper presents a novel evolutionary morphological descriptor for the detection of coronary arteries in X-ray angiograms. The method consists of the vessel detection and segmentation steps. In the first step, the univariate marginal distribution algorithm (UMDA) is used to design the optimal binary template for detecting vessel-like structures by applying the morphological top-hat operator in the spatial image domain. The results of the evolutionary descriptor are compared with those obtained by using methods based on the Hessian matrix, Gaussian filters and top-hat operator. The proposed method obtained the highest performance in terms of the area (A(z)) under the ROC curve (A(z) = 0.9661) compared with five stateof- the-art vessel detection methods using a training set of 50 angiograms and A(z) = 0.9532 with an independent test set of 50 angiograms. In the second step, six thresholding methods are compared in terms of segmentation accuracy in order to classify vessel and nonvessel pixels from the evolutionary filter response. Finally, the experimental results for vessel segmentation with the proposed method provided an accuracy of 0.9580 with the test set of angiograms.",

This paper presents an application of the extended coincident algorithm (COIN-E), which is an instance of the estimation of distribution algorithms, to a multi-objective car sequencing problem on a more realistic platform, i.e. two-sided assembly lines. Three conflicting objectives are optimised simultaneously in a Pareto sense including minimise the number of paint colour changes, minimise the total number of ratio constraint violations and minimise the utility work. The performances of COIN-E are compared with COIN (its original version), NSGA II, DPSO and BBO. The results reveal that COIN-E is superior to the other contestant algorithms in both solution quality and diversity.",

Several methods have been used for this problem: grid search, random search, estimation of distribution Algorithms (EDAs), bio-inspired metaheuristics, among others. The objective of this paper is to determine the optimal method among those that recently reported good results: Bat algorithm, Firefly algorithm, Fruit-fly optimization algorithm, particle Swarm optimization, Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm (UMDA), and Boltzmann-UMDA. The criteria for optimality include measures of effectiveness, generalization, efficiency, and complexity. Experimental results on 15 medical diagnosis problems reveal that EDAs are the optimal strategy under such criteria. Finally, a novel performance index to guide the optimization process, that improves the generalization of the solutions while maintaining their effectiveness, is presented.",

        "description": "Bayesian networks (BNs) are probabilistic graphical models which are widely used for knowledge representation and decision making tasks, especially in the presence of uncertainty. Finding or learning the structure of BNs from data is an NP-hard problem. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been extensively used to automate the learning process. In this paper, we consider the use of the Gene-Pool Optimal Mixing Evolutionary Algorithm (GOMEA). GOMEA is a relatively new type of EA that belongs to the class of model-based EAs. The model used in GOMEA is aimed at modeling the dependency structure between problem variables, so as to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of variation. This paper shows that the excellent performance of GOMEA transfers from well-known academic benchmark problems to the specific case of learning BNs from data due to its model-building capacities and the potential to compute partial evaluations when learning BNs. On commonly-used datasets of varying size, we find that GOMEA outperforms standard algorithms such as Order-based search (OBS), as well as other EAs, such as Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and Estimation of Distribution algorithms (EDAs), even when efficient local search techniques are added.",

        "description": "Suicide bombing is an infamous form of terrorism that is becoming increasingly prevalent in the current era of global terror warfare. We consider the case of targeted attacks of this kind, and the use of detectors distributed over the area under threat as a protective countermeasure. Such detectors are non-fully reliable, and must be strategically placed in order to maximize the chances of detecting the attack, hence minimizing the expected number of casualties. To this end, different metaheuristic approaches based on local search and on population-based search (such as a hill climber, different Greedy randomized adaptive search procedures, an evolutionary algorithm and several estimation of distribution algorithms) are considered and benchmarked against a powerful greedy heuristic from the literature. We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation on synthetic instances featuring very diverse properties. Most metaheuristics outperform the greedy algorithm, and a hill-climber is shown to be superior to remaining approaches. This hill-climber is subsequently subject to a sensitivity analysis to determine which problem features make it stand above the greedy approach, and is finally deployed on a number of problem instances built after realistic scenarios, corroborating the good performance of the heuristic.",

        "description": "The trade-off between diversification and intensification has been investigated recurrently in the field of evolutionary computation. Proof of this is the numerous approaches that have been devoted to finding a balance in the diversificationintensification behavior of algorithms. Despite the large amount of work on this topic, dynamically adjusting such behavior is still difficult and depends on the algorithm at hand. In this paper, we focus on estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs).|Usually, research on EDAs mainly focuses on the design of probability models that either represent as best as possible the characteristics of the problem, or accurately fit the domain of the solutions. In this work, we propose implementing mixtures of probability models that permit the dynamic adjustment of the scope of the EDA. Particularly, we design a mixture model that combines two unimodal Thurstone family probability models: the Plackett-Luce model and the Bradley-Terry model. The first model tends to concentrate the probability around the mode, while the second spreads the probability more. Using a homogeneity measure on the population of solutions, we dynamically decide the ratio of solutions to sample from each model. Performed experiments on the linear ordering problem demonstrate that this research line is definitively promising.",
