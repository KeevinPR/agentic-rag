Subspace estimation of distribution algorithms: To perturb part of all variables in estimation of distribution algorithms,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000287479200004,"Li, HL, Hong, Y and Kwong, S","In the traditional estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), all the variables of candidate individuals are perturbed through sampling from a probability distribution of promising individuals. However, it may be unnecessary for the EDAs to perturb all variables of candidate individuals at each generation. This is because one variable may be dependent on another variable and all variables may have different saliences even if they are independent. Therefore, only a subset of all variables in EDAs really function at each generation.|This paper proposes a novel class of EDAs, termed as subspace estimation of distribution algorithms (subEDAs), from a new perspective to reduce the space of variables for use in model building and model sampling based on EDAs' performance. In subEDAs, only part of all variables of candidate individuals are perturbed at each generation. Three schemes are described in details to determine which variables should be perturbed at each generation: the random picking method (RP), the majority voting based on the similarity between high quality individuals (MVSH) and the majority voting based on the difference between high quality and low quality individuals (MVDHL). Then, subEDAs + RP, subEDAs + MVSH and subEDAs + MVDHL are tested on several benchmark functions and their algorithmic results are compared with those obtained by EDAs. Our experimental results indicate that subEDAs are able to obtain a comparative result using only a subset of problem variables in the model when compared with traditional EDAs. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.

The search for the optimal discretization is carried out as an optimization process with the learning model estimated accuracy guiding it. The global optimization algorithm is based on estimation of distribution algorithms, a set of novel algorithms which are special kinds of evolutionary algorithms. In order to evaluate the behaviour of the algorithm, an analysis of different parameters is performed by means of analysis of variance (ANOVA). The evaluation was carried out using artificial datasets, and with UCI datasets.

Estimation of distribution algorithms with Kikuchi approximations,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000227633700006,"Santana, R","The question of finding feasible ways for estimating probability distributions is one of the main challenges for Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs). To estimate the distribution of the selected solutions, EDAs use factorizations constructed according to graphical models. The class of factorizations that can be obtained from these probability models is highly constrained. Expanding the class of factorizations that could be employed for probability approximation is a necessary step for the conception of more robust EDAs. In this paper we introduce a method for learning a more general class of probability factorizations. The method combines a reformulation of a probability approximation procedure known in statistical physics as the Kikuchi approximation of energy, with a novel approach for finding graph decompositions. We present the Markov Network Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (MN-EDA), an EDA that uses Kikuchi approximations to estimate the distribution, and Gibbs Sampling (GS) to generate new points. A systematic empirical evaluation of MN-EDA is done in comparison with different Bayesian network based EDAs.

Sampling techniques have a serious problem when the sample size is small, so estimating the objective function values with noise is not accurate in this case. In this research, a new sampling technique is proposed based on fuzzy logic to deal with small sample sizes. Then, simulation-based optimization methods are designed by combining the estimation of distribution algorithms with the proposed sampling technique and other sampling techniques to solve the stochastic programming problems. Moreover, additive versions of the proposed methods are developed to optimize functions without noise in order to evaluate different efficiency levels of the proposed methods. In order to test the performance of the proposed methods, different numerical experiments were carried out using several benchmark test functions. Finally, three real-world applications are considered to assess the performance of the proposed methods.",2020
Efficiency enhancement of estimation of distribution algorithms by a compressed tournament selection,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000334211500040,"Martins, JP and Delbem, ACB","Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDA) are population-based meta-heuristics that use probabilistic models to describe the relationships between variables of a problem. From these models, new solutions can be sampled without disruption of Building Blocks, leading to a more effective search. The key aspect of EDAs is the model-building step and better models should enable a better exploration of the search space. However, high-quality models require computationally expensive algorithms, resulting in too costly EDAs. This paper proposes an efficient implementation of the tournament selection algorithm (TS), called Compressed Tournament Selection (CTS). CTS avoids the insertion of repeated solutions in the population during the TS. Therefore, model-building can be performed on a reduced population (equivalent to the original), improving the EDAs' performance as a whole. In the experiments the method was applied to the Extended Compact Genetic Algorithm and the results showed that by using an appropriate tournament size, CTS can lead to high speed-ups without a decrease of model quality. Besides, CTS keeps the characteristics of TS and can be easily used to enhance the efficiency of any EDA based on the tournament selection algorithm.",2014

The inference is an NP-hard problem. There are several algorithms to make exact and approximate inference. One of the most popular, and that is also an exact method. is the evidence propagation algorithm of Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter [S.L. Lauritzen, D.J. Spiegelhalter, Local computations with probabilities on graphical structures and their application on expert systems, journal of the Royal Statistical Society B 50 (2) (1988) 157-224], improved later by Jensen et al.

This algorithm needs an ordering of the variables in order to make the triangulation of the moral graph associated with the original Bayesian network structure. The effectiveness of the inference depends on the variable ordering. In this paper, we will use a new paradigm for evolutionary computation, the estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), to get the optimal ordering of the variables to obtain the most efficient triangulation. We will also present a new type of evolutionary algorithm, the recursive EDAs (REDAs). We will prove that REDAs improve the behaviour of EDAs in this particular problem, and that their results are competitive with other triangulation techniques. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The indeterminacy of the maximum likelihood solutions, multicollinearity of predictor variables and data over-fitting cause unstable parameter estimates. Moreover, computational problems arise due to the large number of predictor (genes) variables. Regularized logistic regression excels as a solution. However, the difficulties found here involve an objective function hard to be optimized from a mathematical viewpoint and a careful required tuning of the regularization parameters.|Methods: Those difficulties are tackled by introducing a new way of regularizing the logistic regression. Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), a kind of evolutionary algorithms, emerge as natural regularizers. Obtaining the regularized estimates of the logistic classifier amounts to maximizing the likelihood function via our EDA, without having to be penalized. Likelihood penalties add a number of difficulties to the resulting optimization problems, which vanish in our case. Simulation of new estimates during the evolutionary process of EDAs is performed in such a way that guarantees their shrinkage while maintaining their probabilistic dependence relationships learnt. The EDA process is embedded in an adapted recursive feature elimination procedure, thereby providing the genes that are best markers for the classification.|Results: The consistency with the literature and excellent classification performance achieved with our algorithm are illustrated on four microarray data sets: Breast, Colon, Leukemia and Prostate.

A Gaussian distribution over continuous variables is commonly used, with several different covariance matrix structures ranging from diagonal i.e. Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm (UMDA(c)) to full i.e. Estimation of Multivariate Normal density Algorithm (EMNA). A diagonal covariance model is simple but is unable to directly represent covariances between problem variables. On the other hand, a full covariance model requires estimation of (more) parameters from the selected population. In practice, numerical issues can arise with this estimation problem. In addition, the performance of the model has been shown to be sometimes undesirable. In this paper, a modified Gaussian-based continuous EDA is proposed, called sEDA, that provides a mechanism to control the amount of covariance parameters estimated within the Gaussian model. To achieve this, a simple variable screening technique from experimental design is adapted and combined with an idea inspired by the Pareto-front in multi-objective optimization. Compared to EMNA(global), the algorithm provides improved numerical stability and can use a smaller selected population.

A key parameter of most EDAs is the sample size (population size). Too small values lead to the undesired effect of genetic drift, while larger values slow down the process. Building on a quantitative analysis of how the population size leads to genetic drift, we design a smart-restart mechanism for EDAs. By stopping runs when the risk for genetic drift is high, it automatically runs the EDA in good parameter regimes. Via a mathematical runtime analysis, we prove a general performance guarantee for this smart-restart scheme. For many situations where the optimal parameter values are known, this shows that the restart scheme automatically finds these optimal values, leading to the asymptotically optimal performance. We also conduct an extensive experimental analysis. On four classic benchmarks, the smart-restart scheme leads to a performance close to the one obtainable with optimal parameter values. We also conduct experiments with PBIL (cross-entropy algorithm) on the max-cut problem and the bipartition problem. Again, the smart-restart mechanism finds much better values for the population size than those suggested in the literature, leading to a much better performance.",2023

Finite population sampling in selection results in fluctuations which get reinforced when the probability model is updated. As a consequence, any probability model which can generate only a single set of values with probability 1 can be an attractive fixed point of the algorithm. To avoid this, parameters of the algorithm must scale with the system size in strongly problem-dependent ways, or the algorithm must be modified. This phenomenon is shown to hold for general EDAs as a consequence of the lack of ergodicity and irreducibility of the Markov chain on the state of probability models. It is illustrated in the case of UMDA, in which it is shown that the global optimum is only found if the population size is sufficiently large. For the needle-in-a haystack problem, the population size must scale as the square-root of the size of the search space.

Understanding the relationship between EDAs and the space of optimization problems is a fundamental issue for the successful application of this type of algorithms. A step forward in this matter is to create a taxonomy of optimization problems according to the different behaviors that an EDA can exhibit. This paper substantially extends previous work in the proposal of a taxonomy of problems for univariate EDAs, mainly by generalizing those results to EDAs that are able to deal with multivariate dependences among the variables of the problem. Through the definition of an equivalence relation between functions, it is possible to partition the space of problems into equivalence classes in which the algorithm has the same behavior. We provide a sufficient and necessary condition to determine the equivalence between functions. This condition is based on a set of matrices which provides a novel encoding of the relationship between the function and the probabilistic model used by the algorithm. The description of the equivalent functions belonging to a class is studied in depth for EDAs whose probabilistic model is given by a chordal Markov network. Assuming this class of factorization, we unveil the intrinsic connection between the behaviors of EDAs and neighborhood systems defined over the search space. In addition, we carry out numerical simulations that effectively reveal the different behaviors of EDAs for the injective functions defined over the search space (0, 1}(3).

Analysis of Computational Time of Simple Estimation of Distribution Algorithms,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000274148700001,"Chen, TS, Tang, K, Yao, X","Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) are widely used in stochastic optimization. Impressive experimental results have been reported in the literature. However, little work has been done on analyzing the computation time of EDAs in relation to the problem size. It is still unclear how well EDAs (with a finite population size larger than two) will scale up when the dimension of the optimization problem (problem size) goes up. This paper studies the computational time complexity of a simple EDA, i.e., the univariate marginal distribution algorithm (UMDA), in order to gain more insight into EDAs complexity. First, we discuss how to measure the computational time complexity of EDAs. A classification of problem hardness based on our discussions is then given. Second, we prove a theorem related to problem hardness and the probability conditions of EDAs. Third, we propose a novel approach to analyzing the computational time complexity of UMDA using discrete dynamic systems and Chernoff bounds. Following this approach, we are able to derive a number of results on the first hitting time of UMDA on a well-known unimodal pseudo-boolean function, i.e., the LeadingOnes problem, and another problem derived from LeadingOnes, named BVLeadingOnes. Although both problems are unimodal, our analysis shows that LeadingOnes is easy for the UMDA, while BVLeadingOnes is hard for the UMDA. Finally, in order to address the key issue of what problem characteristics make a problem hard for UMDA, we discuss in depth the idea of ""margins"" (or relaxation). We prove theoretically that the UMDA with margins can solve the BVLeadingOnes problem efficiently.",2010
Daily Ecopertrol Stock Performance Estimate by Using Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs),Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000319285900017,"Palacio, AP, Orozco, CP, Lochm√ºller, C","In this paper a model, which is based on the principles of evolutionary computation, will be developed and analyzed for financial forecasting and time series prediction. The model refers to returns, prices and transaction volumes of stocks that are listed on the Colombian Stock Exchange (BVC), and particularly to time series that represent the returns of the stocks of Ecopetrol. The proposed model uses the estimation of distribution algorithms (EDA's) for the short-term projection of the returns of such stocks. The EDAs, unlike other optimization techniques that are based on traditional evolution algorithms, provide greater statistical robustness in shaping the population of individuals and with respect to the number of generations that are required to solve the problem. For this purpose the EDA incorporates three dynamic populations that explore the solution space of the problem by using a mechanism which propagates the differences that exist among the best individuals. Additionally, it includes a strategy to preserve the diversity of the population. The proposed model allowed short-term projections for the future values of the returns of Ecopetrol stocks, departing from a set of parameters and variables that make up the stock price. This way the behavior of a specific asset can be described over time and the complexity which is associated with the application of traditional techniques, that allow the modeling of financial time series, can be eliminated.",2012

With the traffic network getting more and more complex, there have been increasing research interests in employing intelligent algorithms to find proper settings for traffic signals. As a special type of evolutionary algorithms, estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) possess strong optimization ability but have seldom been used in traffic signal optimization. In this paper, two efficient variants of continuous EDAs, namely EDA with variance enlargement strategy (EDA(ve)) and EDA with variable-width histogram model (EDA-VWH), are modified and adopted as optimizers to find proper traffic signal cycles in an actual urban area with multiple intersections. The performances of the two resultant algorithms, i.e. modified EDAve (mEDA(ve)) and modified EDA-VWH (mEDA-VWH), are comprehensively studied through a VISSIM-MATLAB integrated simulation platform, which could provide a convenient and close-to-reality simulation environment. The simulation results showed that mEDAve and mEDA-VWH could effectively reduce the mean delay time of all vehicles under different traffic conditions.

This can result in a considerable performance loss. This article gives the first tight quantification of this effect for three EDAs and one ant colony optimizer, namely, for the univariate marginal distribution algorithm, the compact genetic algorithm, population-based incremental learning, and the max-min ant system with iteration-best update.

Therefore, Feature Selection (FS) is integrated to select the significant features, in order to avoid the computational complexity, and improve the classification performance. In this paper, we present a new multi-objective feature selection algorithm MOEDAFS (Multi-Objective Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDA) for Feature Selection). The MOEDAFS is based on EDA and Mutual Information (MI). EDA is used to explore the search space and MI is integrated as a probabilistic model to guide the search by modeling the redundancy and relevance relations between features. Therefore, we propose four probabilistic models for MOEDAFS. MOEDAFS selects the better feature subsets (non-dominated solutions) that have a better detection accuracy and smaller number of features. MOEDAFS uses two objective functions (minimizing classification Error Rate (ER) and minimizing the Number of Features(NF)). In order to demonstrate the performance of MOEDAFS, a comparative study is designed by internal and external comparison on NSL-KDD dataset.

Towards the Geometry of Estimation of Distribution Algorithms Based on the Exponential Family,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000290468900020,"Malag√≤, L, Matteucci, M and Pistone, G","In this paper we present a geometrical framework for the analysis of Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) based on the exponential family. From a theoretical point of view, an EDA can be modeled as a sequence of densities in a statistical model that converges towards distributions with reduced support. Under this framework, at each iteration the empirical mean of the fitness function decreases in probability, until convergence of the population. This is the context of stochastic relaxation, i.e., the idea of looking for the minima of a function by minimizing its expected value over a set of probability densities. Our main interest is in the study of the gradient of the expected value of the function to be minimized, and in particular on how its landscape changes according to the fitness function and the statistical model used in the relaxation. After introducing some properties of the exponential family, such as the description of its topological closure and of its tangent space, we provide a characterization of the stationary points of the relaxed problem, together with a study of the minimizing sequences with reduced support. The analysis developed in the paper aims to provide a theoretical understanding of the behavior of EDAs, and in particular their ability to converge to the global minimum of the fitness function.

These guidelines will enhance the designed algorithms in balancing the intensification and diversification effects of EDAs. Most EDAs have the advantage of incorporating probabilistic models which can generate chromosomes with the non-disruption of salient genes. This advantage, however, may cause the problem of the premature convergence of EDAs resulted in the probabilistic models no longer generating diversified solutions. In addition, due to overfitting of the search space, probabilistic models cannot really represent the general information of the population. Therefore, this research will deduce important guidelines through the convergency speed analysis of EDAs under different computational times for designing effective EDA algorithms. The major idea is to increase the population diversity gradually by hybridizing EDAs with other meta-heuristics and replacing the procedures of sampling new solutions. According to that, this research further proposes an Adaptive EA/G to improve the performance of EA/G. The proposed algorithm solves the single machine scheduling problems with earliness/tardiness cost in a just-in-time scheduling environment.

First, candidate parents of each variable in Bayesian networks are detected by means of L1-regularized logistic regression, with the aim of leading a sparse but nearly optimized network structure. Second, the greedy search, which is restricted to the candidate parent-child pairs, is deployed to identify the final structure.

This article introduces a method for automated topological optimization via an Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) with a suitable representation of the optimization variables. The optimum structure is such with the minimum weight which does not exceed a maximum von Mises stress and displacement. The contributions of this proposal resides in the definition of a candidate solution and the optimization method. The candidate solution representation is independent of the finer discretization used for analyzing candidate structures using the finite element method. Given a domain Omega, which corresponds to the physical space where candidate structures reside, a vector phi = [phi(1), phi(2), ..., phi(m)] is used to define a smooth function (phi) over cap (x, y) on Omega. If (phi) over cap (x, y) is less than 0.5, such region does not have material, otherwise, it has. The smooth function phi(x, y) provides the advantage of having continuous regions with or without material while it depends on few optimization parameters 0, in addition, we can define an arbitrary number of parts or gaps as thinner or larger as needed. The EDA benefits from this representation, sampling random arbitrary structures and using probabilistic learning to determine whether a region must have material. The EDA is a global optimizer which can propose different topologies without the need of a priori knowledge neither initial solutions. In addition it uses a probabilistic model which smoothly evolve through generations. In consequence, at the beginning of the optimization process it arbitrarily proposes topologically different structures, while at the convergence phase it performs similar to a local search algorithm.

Addressing the advantages of using ensemble probabilistic models in Estimation of Distribution Algorithms for scheduling problems,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000312759600004,"Chen, SH and Chen, MC","Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) have recently been recognized as a prominent alternative to traditional evolutionary algorithms due to their increasing popularity. The core of EDAs is a probabilistic model which directly impacts performance of the algorithm. Previous EDAs have used a univariate, bi-variate, or multi-variable probabilistic model each time. However, application of only one probabilistic model may not represent the parental distribution well. This paper advocates the importance of using ensemble probabilistic models in EDAs. We combine the univariate probabilistic model with the bi-variate probabilistic model which learns different population characteristics. To explain how to employ the two probabilistic models, we proposed the Ensemble Self-Guided Genetic Algorithm (eSGGA). The extensive computation results on two NP-hard scheduling problems indicate the advantages of adopting two probabilistic models. Most important of all, eSGGA can avoid the computation effort overhead when compared with other EDAs employing two models. As a result, this paper might point out a next generation approach for EDAs.

In this paper, we lay the foundations to elaborate taxonomies of problems under estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). By using an infinite population model and assuming that the selection operator is based on the rank of the solutions, we group optimization problems according to the behavior of the EDA. Throughout the definition of an equivalence relation between functions it is possible to partition the space of problems in equivalence classes in which the algorithm has the same behavior. We show that only the probabilistic model is able to generate different partitions of the set of possible problems and hence, it predetermines the number of different behaviors that the algorithm can exhibit. As a natural consequence of our definitions, all the objective functions are in the same equivalence class when the algorithm does not impose restrictions to the probabilistic model. The taxonomy of problems, which is also valid for finite populations, is studied in depth for a simple EDA that considers independence among the variables of the problem. We provide the sufficient and necessary condition to decide the equivalence between functions and then we develop the operators to describe and count the members of a class. In addition, we show the intrinsic relation between univariate EDAs and the neighborhood system induced by the Hamming distance by proving that all the functions in the same class have the same number of local optima and that they are in the same ranking positions. Finally, we carry out numerical simulations in order to analyze the different behaviors that the algorithm can exhibit for the functions defined over the search space {0, 1}(3).",2013

Integrated with clustering strategies for crowding and speciation, two versions of this algorithm are developed, which operate at the niche level. Then these two algorithms are equipped with three distinctive techniques: 1) a dynamic cluster sizing strategy; 2) an alternative utilization of Gaussian and Cauchy distributions to generate offspring; and 3) an adaptive local search. The dynamic cluster sizing affords a potential balance between exploration and exploitation and reduces the sensitivity to the cluster size in the niching methods. Taking advantages of Gaussian and Cauchy distributions, we generate the offspring at the niche level through alternatively using these two distributions. Such utilization can also potentially offer a balance between exploration and exploitation. Further, solution accuracy is enhanced through a new local search scheme probabilistically conducted around seeds of niches with probabilities determined self-adaptively according to fitness values of these seeds. Extensive experiments conducted on 20 benchmark multimodal problems confirm that both algorithms can achieve competitive performance compared with several state-of-the-art multimodal algorithms, which is supported by nonparametric tests.

This means that as population sizes increase the dependency between variable values for any strict subset of a parity function's bits decreases. Unfortunately most EDAs including hBOA search for their models by looking for dependencies between pairs of variables (at least at first).

However like high quality individuals, these neglected low quality individuals also contain some important information that may be useful for guiding the search of estimation of distribution algorithms. This paper proposes a novel kind of estimation of distribution algorithms, where both high quality and low quality individuals in the old population are employed for reproducing new candidate individuals at the next generation. In particular, both the density P-H(X) of high quality individuals and the density P-L(X) of low quality individuals are estimated; then the new population G is obtained with the following steps employed: 1) a new candidate individual x is reproduced through sampling from the density P-H(X); 2) to let P-H(X = x) and P-L(X = x) compare and the individual x will be stored into the new population G if and only if P-H(X = x) >= P-L(X = x); 3) the above steps repeat until M new individuals have been successfully generated where M is the population size.|To demonstrate the usefulness of low quality individuals for estimation of distribution algorithms, estimation of distribution algorithms using both high quality and low quality individuals are tested on several benchmark problems and their results are compared with those obtained by estimation of distribution algorithms where only high quality individuals are used.

They are similar to Genetic Algorithms (GAs), in the sense that, given a problem, they use a population of individuals to represent solutions, and this population is made to evolve towards the most promising solutions. However, instead of using the usual GA-operators such as mutation or crossover, EDAs learn a probabilistic model that tries to capture the main characteristics of the problem. Based on this idea, several EDAs have been introduced in the last years, showing a good performance and being able to solve problems of different complexity. One important drawback of EDAs is the significant computational effort required by the utilization of probabilistic models, when applied to real-world problems. This fact has led the research community to apply parallel schemes to EDAs, as a viable way to reduce execution times. Schemes already proposed for GAs have been used as the foundation for these parallel schemes. In this chapter, we make a review of parallel EDAs, with a main focus: identifying those parts that are susceptible of parallelization.

Runtime Analyses of the Population-Based Univariate Estimation of Distribution Algorithms on LeadingOnes,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000690372900001,"Lehre, PK and Nguyen, PTH","We perform rigorous runtime analyses for the univariate marginal distribution algorithm (UMDA) and the population-based incremental learning (PBIL) Algorithm on LeadingOnes. For the UMDA, the currently known expected runtime on the function is O(n lambda log lambda + n(2)) under an offspring population size lambda = Omega(log n) and a parent population size mu <= lambda/(e(1 + delta)) for any constant delta > 0 (Dang and Lehre, GECCO 2015). There is no lower bound on the expected runtime under the same parameter settings. It also remains unknown whether the algorithm can still optimise the LeadingOnes function within a polynomial runtime when mu >= lambda/(e(1+delta)). In case of the PBIL, an expected runtime of O(n(2+c)) holds for some constant c is an element of(0,1) (Wu, Kolonko and Mohring, IEEE TEVC 2017). Despite being a generalisation of the UMDA, this upper bound is significantly asymptotically looser than the upper bound of O(n(2) of the UMDA for lambda=Omega(log n) boolean AND O. Furthermore, the required population size is very large, i.e., lambda=Omega(n(1+c)). Our contributions are then threefold: (1) we show that the UMDA with mu=Omega(log n) and lambda <= mu e(1-epsilon)/(1+delta) for any constants epsilon is an element of(0,1) and 0 < delta <= e(1-epsilon)-1 requires an expected runtime of e(Omega(mu)) on LEADINGONES, (2) an upper bound of O(n lambda log lambda + n(2)) is shown for the PBIL, which improves the current bound O(n(2+c)) by a significant factor of Theta(n(c)), and (3) we for the first time consider the two algorithms on the LeadingOnes function in a noisy environment and obtain an expected runtime of O(n(2)) for appropriate parameter settings.

Since there are no explicit search procedures for the probability density structure, it is possible to rapidly estimate the distribution and readily sample the new individuals from it. Our experimental results support that presented estimation of distribution algorithms with PPCA can find good solutions more efficiently than other EDAs for the continuous spaces.",2001
Estimation of Distribution Algorithms Applied to History Matching,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000320295100010,"Abdollahzadeh, A, Reynolds, A, Davies, B","The topic of automatically history-matched reservoir models has seen much research activity in recent years. History matching is an example of an inverse problem, and there is significant active research on inverse problems in many other scientific and engineering areas. While many techniques from other fields, such as genetic algorithms, evolutionary strategies, differential evolution, particle swarm optimization, and the ensemble Kalman filter have been tried in the oil industry, more recent and effective ideas have yet to be tested. One of these relatively untested ideas is a class of algorithms known as estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). EDAs are population-based algorithms that use probability models to estimate the probability distribution of promising solutions, and then to generate new candidate solutions. EDAs have been shown to be very efficient in very complex high-dimensional problems.|An example of a state-of-the-art EDA is the Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA), which is a multivariate EDA employing Bayesian networks for modeling the relationships between good solutions. The use of a Bayesian network leads to relatively fast convergence as well as high diversity in the matched models. Given the relatively limited number of reservoir simulations used in history matching, EDA-BOA offers the promise of high-quality history matches with a fast convergence rate.|In this paper, we introduce EDAs and describe BOA in detail. We show results of the EDA-BOA algorithm on two history-matching problems. First, we tune the algorithm, demonstrate convergence speed, and search diversity on the PUNQ-S3 synthetic case. Second, we apply the algorithm to a real North Sea turbidite field with multiple wells. In both examples, we show improvements in performance over traditional population-based algorithms.",2013

In the second stage, UMDA and PCEA are then tested on more complex noisy problems: SubsetSum, Knapsack, and SetCover. Both perform well under increasing levels of noise, with UMDA being the better of the two.

Gibbs sampling allows us to sample new individuals inside the boundaries of the polyhedral search space described using a set of linear inequality constraints by iteratively constructing a density approximation that lies entirely inside the polyhedron. Gibbs sampling prevents the creation of infeasible solutions. Thus, no additional techniques for handling infeasible solutions are needed in PolyEDA.

So far, the studies or applications of multivariate probabilistic model-based EDAs in continuous domain are still mostly restricted to low-dimensional problems. Traditional EDAs have difficulties in solving higher dimensional problems because of the curse of dimensionality and rapidly increasing computational costs. However, scaling up continuous EDAs for large-scale optimization is still necessary, which is supported by the distinctive feature of EDAs: because a probabilistic model is explicitly estimated, from the learned model one can discover useful properties of the problem. Besides obtaining a good solution, understanding of the problem structure can be of great benefit, especially for black box optimization. We propose a novel EDA framework with model complexity control (EDA-MCC) to scale up continuous EDAs. By employing weakly dependent variable identification and subspace modeling, EDA-MCC shows significantly better performance than traditional EDAs on high-dimensional problems. Moreover, the computational cost and the requirement of large population sizes can be reduced in EDA-MCC. In addition to being able to find a good solution, EDA-MCC can also provide useful problem structure characterizations. EDA-MCC is the first successful instance of multivariate model-based EDAs that can be effectively applied to a general class of up to 500-D problems.

The choice of these models as well as the corresponding training processes are subject to the bias/variance tradeoff, also known as under- and overfitting: simple models cannot capture complex interactions between problem variables, whereas complex models are susceptible to modeling random noise. This paper suggests using Denoising Autoencoders (DAEs) as generative models within EDAs (DAE-EDA). The resulting DAE-EDA is able to model complex probability distributions. Furthermore, overfitting is less harmful, since DAEs overfit by learning the identity function. This overfitting behavior introduces unbiased random noise into the samples, which is no major problem for the EDA but just leads to higher population diversity. As a result, DAE-EDA runs for more generations before convergence and searches promising parts of the solution space more thoroughly. We study the performance of DAE-EDA on several combinatorial single-objective optimization problems. In comparison to the Bayesian Optimization Algorithm, DAE-EDA requires a similar number of evaluations of the objective function but is much faster and can be parallelized efficiently, making it the preferred choice especially for large and difficult optimization problems.",2020

Compared to Michigan-style GBML, Pittsburgh-style GBML is expected to achieve more compact solutions. It has been shown that standard recombination operators in EAs do not assure an effective evolutionary search to solve sophisticated problems that contain strong interactions between features. On the other hand, when dealing with real-world classification tasks, irrelevant features not only complicate the problem but also incur unnecessary matchings in GBML systems, which increase the computational cost a lot. To handle the two problems mentioned above in an integrated manner, a new Pittsburgh-style GBML system is proposed. In the proposed method, classifiers are generated and recombined at two levels. At the high level, classifiers are recombined by rule-wise uniform crossover operators since each classifier consists of a variable-size rule set. At the low level, single rules contained in classifiers are reproduced via sampling Bayesian networks that characterize the global statistical information extracted from promising rules found so far. Furthermore, according to the statistical information in the rule population, an embedded approach is presented to detect and remove redundant features incrementally following the evolution of rule population. Results of empirical evaluation show that the proposed method outperforms the original Pittsburgh-style GBML system in terms of classification accuracy while reducing the computational cost. Furthermore, the proposed method is also competitive to other non-evolutionary, highly used machine learning methods. With respect to the performance of feature reduction, the proposed embedded approach is able to deliver solutions with higher classification accuracy when removing the same number of features as other feature reduction techniques do.

In addition, the elite genetic strategy is used to generate the next population. In this way, it reduces the possibility of losing the optimal solutions. To verify the efficiency of this algorithm, the simulation experiments are performed. The comparative results of three classic examples are given.",2012

Unified eigen analysis on multivariate Gaussian based estimation of distribution algorithms,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000257404100003,"Dong, WS and Yao, X","Multivariate Gaussian models are widely adopted in continuous estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), and covariance matrix plays the essential role in guiding the evolution. In this paper, we propose a new framework for multivariate Gaussian based EDAs (MGEDAs), named eigen decomposition EDA (ED-EDA). Unlike classical EDAs, ED-EDA focuses on eigen analysis of the covariance matrix, and it explicitly tunes the eigenvalues. All existing MGEDAs can be unified within our ED-EDA framework by applying three different eigenvalue tuning strategies. The effects of eigenvalue on influencing the evolution are investigated through combining maximum likelihood estimates of Gaussian model with each of the eigenvalue tuning strategies in ED-EDA. In our experiments, proper eigenvalue tunings show high efficiency in solving problems with small population sizes, which are difficult for classical MGEDA adopting maximum likelihood estimates alone. Previously developed covariance matrix repairing (CMR) methods focusing on repairing computational errors of covariance matrix can be seen as a special eigenvalue tuning strategy. By using the ED-EDA framework, the computational time of CMR methods can be reduced from cubic to linear. Two new efficient CMR methods are proposed. Through explicitly tuning eigenvalues, ED-EDA provides a new approach to develop more efficient Gaussian based EDAs. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",2008

We introduce, and utilize in DICE, a model based on dichotomised multivariate Gaussian distributions. These models are able to capture and make use of all O(d 2) bivariate variable interactions in binary and multary search spaces.

Pairwise independence and its impact on Estimation of Distribution Algorithms,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000373548400004,"Martins, JP and Delbem, ACB","Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) were proposed as an alternative for traditional evolutionary algorithms in which reproduction operators could rely on information extracted from the population to enable a more effective search. Since information is usually represented as a probabilistic graphic model, the effectiveness of EDAs strongly depends on how accurately such models represent the population. In this sense, models of increasing complexity have been employed by EDAs, with the most successful ones being able to encode multivariate factorizations of joint probability distributions. However, some studies have shown that even multivariate EDAs fail to build accurate models for problems in which there is an intrinsic pairwise independence between variables. This study elucidates how pairwise independence impacts the linkage learning procedures of multivariate EDAs and affects their accuracy. First, the necessary conditions for learning additively separable functions are assessed, from which it is shown that extreme multimodality can induce pairwise independence. Second, it is demonstrated that in the presence of pairwise independence the approximate linkage learning procedures employed by many EDAs are not able to retrieve high-order dependences. Finally, in an attempt to infer how likely pairwise independence occur in practical problems, the case of non-separable functions is empirically investigated. For this purpose, the NK-model and the Linkage-Tree Genetic Algorithm (LTGA) were used as a study case and a range of usefulness for the LTGA was estimated according to N (problem size) and K (degree of interactions among variables and multimodality). The results indicated that LTGA linkage learning is probably more useful for K <= 6 on instances with random linkages (this range grows with N), and for K <= 9 on instances with nearest-neighbor linkages (this range is stable with N). Outside these ranges, pairwise independence is more likely to occur, which deteriorates models accuracy and impairs LTGA performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2016

Peakbin Selection in Mass Spectrometry Data Using a Consensus Approach with Estimation of Distribution Algorithms,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000288225000015,"Arma√±anzas, R, Saeys, Y, Larra√±aga, P","Progress is continuously being made in the quest for stable biomarkers linked to complex diseases. Mass spectrometers are one of the devices for tackling this problem. The data profiles they produce are noisy and unstable. In these profiles, biomarkers are detected as signal regions (peaks), where control and disease samples behave differently. Mass spectrometry (MS) data generally contain a limited number of samples described by a high number of features. In this work, we present a novel class of evolutionary algorithms, estimation of distribution algorithms (EDA), as an efficient peak selector in this MS domain. There is a trade-of f between the reliability of the detected biomarkers and the low number of samples for analysis. For this reason, we introduce a consensus approach, built upon the classical EDA scheme, that improves stability and robustness of the final set of relevant peaks. An entire data workflow is designed to yield unbiased results. Four publicly available MS data sets (two MALDI-TOF and another two SELDI-TOF) are analyzed. The results are compared to the original works, and a new plot (peak frequential plot) for graphically inspecting the relevant peaks is introduced.

Robust estimation of distribution algorithms via fitness landscape analysis for optimal low-thrust orbital maneuvers,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:001144198200001,"Shirazi, A","One particular kind of evolutionary algorithms known as Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) has gained the attention of the aerospace industry for its ability to solve nonlinear and complicated problems, particularly in the optimization of space trajectories during on-orbit operations of satellites. This article describes an effective method for optimizing the trajectory of a spacecraft using an evolutionary approach based on EDAs, incorporated with fitness landscape analysis (FLA). The approach utilizes flexible operators that are paired with seeding and selection mechanisms of EDAs. Initially, the orbit transfer problem is mathematically modeled and the objectives and constraints are identified. The landscape feature of the search space is analyzed via the dispersion metric to measure the modality and ruggedness of the search domain. The obtained information are used as feedback in developing adaptive operators for truncation factor and constraints separation threshold of the employed EDA. A framework for spacecraft trajectory optimization has been presented where the dispersion value for a space mission is estimated using a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm. The suggested method is used to solve several problems related to low-thrust orbit transfer of satellites in Earth's orbit. Results demonstrate that the suggested framework for trajectory design and optimization of space transfers is effective enough to offer fuel-efficient and energy-efficient maneuvers for different thrust levels of the propulsion system. Moreover, the performance of the proposed approach is evaluated against non-adaptive EDA and other advanced evolutionary algorithms. The obtained results certify that the proposed adaptive evolutionary approach is superior in identifying feasible minimum-fuel and minimum-energy transfer trajectories.",2023

GNP uses multiple reusable nodes to construct directed-graph structures to represent its solutions. Recently, many research has clarified that GNP can work well in data mining area. In this paper, a novel evolutionary paradigm named GNP with Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (GNP-EDAs) is proposed and used to solve traffic prediction problems using class association rule mining. In GNP-EDAs, a probabilistic model is constructed by estimating the probability distribution from the selected elite individuals of the previous generation to replace the conventional genetic operators, such as crossover and mutation. The probabilistic model is capable of enhancing the evolution to achieve the ultimate objective. In this paper, two methods are proposed based on extracting the probabilistic information on the node connections and node transitions of GNP-EDAs to construct the probabilistic model. A comparative study of the proposed paradigm and the conventional GNP is made to solve the traffic prediction problems using class association rule mining. The simulation results showed that GNP-EDAs can extract the class association rules more effectively, when the number of the candidate class association rules increases.

How to Get More from Your Model: The Role of Constructive Selection in Estimation of Distribution Algorithms,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000625865500051,"Caldwell, JR and Watson, RA","Model-building optimisation methods aim to learn the structure underlying a problem and exploit this to direct the exploration of solutions. This generally interleaves two processes: Generating samples (from the model), and updating the model (using selected samples). In most estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), e.g. BOA, selection is used only in the laSer, to determine which samples are retained for updating the model. In contrast, other evolution-inspired algorithms (such as rHN-G and MACRO) use selection differently - within the process that generates samples from the model. It has been hypothesised that this 'constructive selection' process can facilitate optimisation that other EDAs cannot but this has not been previously shown. Here we investigate these distinctions using constraint optimisation problems with a very simple modular structure. We find that a simple constructive selection method (rHN-g) can solve these problems in time polynomial in the problem size whereas other methods, such as BOA, require exponential time. We confirm that this result arises not from any difficulty in acquiring an accurate model but because of how samples are generated given the model. This suggests that by using constructive selection other EDAs could exploit the models they learn more efficiently to solve otherwise unsolvable problems.",2017

However, decision-tree induction algorithms have limitations due to the typical recursive top-down greedy search they implement. Such local search may often lead to quality loss while the partitioning process occurs, generating statistically insignificant rules. In order to avoid the typical greedy strategy and to prevent convergence to local optima, we present a novel Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) for decision-tree induction, namely Ardennes. For evaluating the proposed approach, we present results of an empirical analysis in 10 real-world classification datasets. We compare Ardennes with both a well-known traditional greedy algorithm for decision-tree induction and also with a more recent global population-based approach. Results show the feasibility of using EDAs as a means to avoid the previously-described problems. We report gains when using Ardennes in terms of accuracy and - equally important - tree comprehensibility.",2017

Diversity loss in general estimation of distribution algorithms,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000241446400010,"Shapiro, JL","A very general class of EDAs is defined, on which universal results on the rate of diversity loss can be derived.

This class is very general; it includes simple forms of many well-known EDAs, e.g. BOA, MIMIC, FDA, UMDA, etc. To study the diversity loss in SML-EDAs, the trace of the empirical covariance matrix is the proposed statistic. Two simple results are derived. Let N be the number of data vectors evaluated in each generation. It is shown that on a flat landscape, the expected value of the statistic decreases by a factor 1 - 1/N in each generation.

So far, the analysis of this class of algorithms was confined to proportional selection and additive decomposable functions. Dropping both assumptions, we consider here truncation selection and non-separable problems with polynomial number of distinct fitness values. The emergent modelling is half theoretical - with respect to selection, completely characterized by stochastic calculus and half empirical - concerning the generation of new individuals. For the latter operator, we sample the chromosomes arbitrarily, one for each selected level of fitness.

A Mahalanobis Distance-based Fitness Approximation Method for Estimation of Distribution Algorithms in Solving Expensive Optimization Problems,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000521353901106,"Liang, YS, Ren, ZG, Pang, B","Fitness approximation methods have been widely employed in evolutionary algorithms to reduce the number of fitness evaluations in solving expensive optimization problems. As a simple and efficient approximation approach, k-nearest neighbors (kNN) estimates the fitness value of an unknown solution by combining the fitness values of its nearest neighbors according to a similarity measure. kNN generally adopts the Euclidean distance as the similarity measure, which may limit its performance as the solution distribution information is underutilized in the approximation process. Aiming at this issue, this study proposes a Mahalanobis distance-based k-nearest neighbors (MkNN) to improve the approximation accuracy by utilizing the distribution information. Compared to the Euclidean distance-based kNN (EkNN), MkNN adopts the Mahalanobis distance to measure the similarity between solutions, which is capable of capturing the distribution information of solutions and thus can improve the approximation efficiency. Furthermore, considering that the main idea of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) is also to learn the distribution information of solutions, the proposed MkNN as well as EkNN are combined with an EDA and two new algorithms named EDA-MkNN and EDA-EkNN, respectively, are developed for expensive optimization. The performances of EDA-MkNN and EDA-EkNN were comprehensively tested on a set of 28 benchmark functions and compared with that of a typical EDA. Experimental results demonstrate that MkNN and EkNN could effectively improve the performance of EDA in solving different kinds of expensive optimization problems and MkNN can have an edge over EkNN on condition that the distribution information is well captured.",2019

Recently, a first study that used basic Gaussian EDAs indicated that typically suggested algorithmic parameter settings do not necessarily transfer well to the CiaS problem. In this article, we consider also AMaLGaM, an enhanced Gaussian EDA, as well as arguably the most powerful real-valued black-box optimization algorithm to date, CMA-ES, which can also be seen as a further enhanced Gaussian EDA. We study whether the well-known performance on typical benchmark problems extends to the CiaS problem. We find that although the enhancements over a basic Gaussian EDA result in superior performance, the further efficiency enhancements in CMA-ES are not highly impactful. Instead, the most impactful features are how constraint handling is performed, how large the population size is, whether a full covariance matrix is used and whether restart techniques are used. We further show that a previously published version of AMaLGaM that does not require the user to set the the population size parameter is capable of solving the problem and we derive the scalability of the required number of function evaluations to solve the problem up to 99.99 % of the known optimal value for up to 30 circles.",2018

Decomposition of Dynamic Single-Product and Multi-product Lotsizing Problems and Scalability of EDAs,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000266823300012,"Grahl, J, Minner, S and Rothlauf, F","In existing theoretical and experimental work, Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) are primarily applied to decomposable test problems. State-of-the-art EDAs like the Hierarchical Bayesian Optimization Algorithm (hBOA), the Learning Factorized Distribution Algorithm (LFDA) or Estimation of Bayesian Networks Algorithm (EBNA) solve these problems in polynomial time. Regarding this success, it is tempting to apply EDAs to real-world problems. But up to now, it has rarely been analyzed which real-world problems are decomposable. The main contribution of this chapter is twofold: (1) It shows that uncapacitated single-product and multi-product lotsizing problems are decomposable. (2) A state-of-the-art EDA is used to solve both problems. The problems are fundamental in inventory management and their fitness functions can be expressed as additively decomposable functions. It is analyzed how a search distribution of Boltzmann-type factorizes for these functions and it is shown that the factorizations of the Boltzmann distribution are polynomially bounded. Consequently, experimental scalability analysis is conducted for both problems with a state-of-the-art EDA. The total number of fitness evaluations required to reliably solve the problems to optimality is found to grow with a low-order polynomial depending on the problem size. The results confirm existing scalability theory for decomposable problems.",2008

At the higher level, classifiers are recombined by rule-wise uniform crossover operators to keep the semantics of rules in each classifier.

As a first we present a family of discrete bivariate EDAs that can learn and exploit all dependencies between variables, and yet have the same run-time complexity as their more limited counterparts. This family of algorithms, which we label DICE (DIscrete Correlated Estimation of distribution algorithms), is rigorously based on sound statistical principles, and particularly on a modelling technique from statistical physics: dichotomised multivariate Gaussian distributions. Initially (Lane et al. in European Conference on the Applications of Evolutionary Computation, Springer, 1999), DICE was trialled on a suite of combinatorial optimization problems over binary search spaces. Our proposed dichotomised Gaussian (DG) model in DICE significantly outperformed existing discrete bivariate EDAs; crucially, the performance gap increasingly widened as dimensionality of the problems increased. In this comprehensive treatment, we generalise DICE by successfully extending it to multary search spaces that also allow for categorical variables. Because correlation is not wholly meaningful for categorical variables, interactions between such variables cannot be fully modelled by correlation-based approaches such as in the original formulation of DICE. Therefore, here we extend our original DG model to deal with such situations. We test DICE on a challenging test suite of combinatorial optimization problems, which are defined mostly on multary search spaces. While the two versions of DICE outperform each other on different problem instances, they both outperform all the state-of-the-art bivariate EDAs on almost all of the problem instances.

To optimize a jump function, an algorithm must be able to execute an initial hill-climbing phase, after which a point across a large gap must be generated. Standard GAs mix mutation and crossover to achieve both behaviors. It seems likely that other techniques, such as estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) may exhibit such behavior, but an analysis is so far missing.|We analyze an EDA called the compact Genetic Algorithm (cGA) on jump functions with gap k. We prove that the cGA initially exhibits a strong positive drift resulting in good hillclimbing behavior. Interpreting the diversity of the process as the variance of the underlying probabilistic model, we show the existence of a critical point beyond which progress slows and diversity vanishes. If k is not too large, the cGA generates with high probability an optimal solution in polynomial time before losing diversity. For k = Omega(logn), this yields a superpolynomial speedup over mutation-only approaches.

A very natural model of the problem to be solved is the Boltzmann distribution of the fitness function, which is an exponential of the fitness normalized to a probability distribution. As the exponentiation factor (inverse temperature) of the Boltzmann distribution is increased, probability is increasingly concentrated on the set of optimal points. We show that for fitness functions of k-bounded epistasis that satisfy an additional property called the running intersection property, an explicit computable exact factorization of the Boltzmann distribution with an arbitrary exponentiation factor can be constructed.

More precisely, an effect called ""domino convergence"" is described in the literature, which means that bits of large weight in the linear function are optimized earlier than bits of low weight. Hence, different linear functions may lead to rather different expected optimization times.|The present paper conducts a study of domino convergence. By rigorous runtime analyses, it is shown that domino convergence is mostly a consequence of the crossover underlying genetic algorithms and EDAs. Here a performance gap of order O(n/logn) between different linear functions is proved. In simple mutationonly EAs the effect of domino convergence is much less pronounced, with the typical performance gap being logarithmic in the population size. The effect disappears when population size 1 is used and the algorithm is reduced to hillclimbing.

Nevertheless, their efficiency and effectiveness directly depends on how accurate the deployed probabilistic models are, which in turn depend on methods of model building. Although the best models found in the literature are often built by computationally complex methods, whose corresponding EDAs require high running time, these methods may evaluate a lesser number of points in the search space. In order to find a better trade-off between running time (efficiency) and the number of evaluated points (effectiveness), this work uses probabilistic models built by algorithms of phylogenetic reconstruction, since some of them are able to efficiently produce accurate models. Then, an EDA, namely, Optimization based on Phylogram Analysis, and a new search technique, namely, Composed Exhaustive Search, are developed and proposed to find solutions for combinatorial optimization problems with different levels of difficulty. Experimental results show that the proposed new EDA features an interesting trade-off between running time and number of evaluated points, attaining solutions near to the best results found in the literature for each one of such performance measures.

However, it has been pointed out that current MOEDAs have an intrinsic shortcoming in their model-building algorithms that hamper their performance. In this work, we put forward the argument that error-based learning, the class of learning most commonly used in MOEDAs is responsible for current MOEDA underachievement. We present adaptive resonance theory (ART) as a suitable learning paradigm alternative and present a novel algorithm called multi-objective ART-based EDA (MARTEDA) that uses a Gaussian ART neural network for model-building and a hypervolume-based selector as described for the HypE algorithm. In order to assert the improvement obtained by combining two cutting-edge approaches to optimization an extensive set of experiments are carried out.

We apply this methodology to investigate the specific issue of explicit dependency modeling in simple continuous estimation of distribution algorithms. Experimental results reveal specific examples of landscapes (with certain identifiable features) where dependency modeling is useful, harmful, or has little impact on mean algorithm performance. Heat maps are used to compare algorithm performance over a large number of landscape instances and algorithm trials.

Thus, the problem is known to be multi-level as the performance of a given architecture is unknown until its parameters are tuned using classical routines. Moreover, the task becomes even more complicated since well-known trainability issues, e.g., barren plateaus (BPs), can occur. In this paper, we aim to achieve two improvements in QAS: (1) to reduce the number of measurements by an online surrogate model of the evaluation process that aggressively discards architectures of poor performance; (2) to avoid training the circuits when BPs are present. To detect the presence of the BPs, we employed a recently developed metric, information content, which only requires measuring the energy values of a small set of parameters to estimate the magnitude of cost function's gradient. The main idea of this proposal is to leverage a recently developed metric which can be used to detect the onset of vanishing gradients to ensure the overall search avoids such unfavorable regions. We experimentally validate our proposal for the variational quantum eigensolver and showcase that our algorithm is able to find solutions that have been previously proposed in the literature for the Hamiltonians; but also to outperform the state of the art when initializing the method from the set of architectures proposed in the literature.

So far, various continuous EDAs have been developed based on different probability models. Initially, the EDAs based on a single Gaussian probability model are widely used but they have trouble in solving multimodal problems. Later EDAs based on a mixture model and on a clustering technique are then introduced to conquer such drawback. However, they are either time consuming or need prior knowledge of the problems. Recently, the histogram has begun to be used in continuous EDAs, but the histogram based EDAs (HEDAs) usually need too much time and space to gain a highly accurate solution. On the basis of pioneering contributions, this paper proposes a fuzzy histogram based EDA (FHEDA) for continuous optimization. In the FHEDA, the estimated range of the fuzzy histogram is adjusted adaptively by the current promising solutions, which leads the algorithm to search good solutions efficiently. A mutation mechanism is also introduced in the sampling operation to avoid being trapped in local optima. The performance of the proposed FHEDA is evaluated by testing seven benchmark functions with different characteristics. Two Gaussian based EDAs and the sur-shr-HEDA are studied for comparison.

Recently, a new approach to EDAs has been developed, based on copula theory, to improve the estimation of the joint probability distribution function. However, most copula-based EDAs still present two major drawbacks: focus on copulas with constant parameters, and premature convergence.

However, direct sampling from the Boltzmann-PDF to update the probabilistic model is unpractical, and several EDAs employ an approximation to the Boltzmann-PDF by means of a Gaussian distribution that is usually derived by the minimization of the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL-divergence) computed between the Gaussian and the Boltzmann-PDFs.

It enables the classification system to achieve good or even better solutions with a restricted subset of features, allows for a faster classification, and it helps the human expert focus on a relevant subset of features, hence providing useful biological knowledge.|Results: We present a heuristic method based on Estimation of Distribution Algorithms to select relevant subsets of features for splice site prediction in Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that this method performs a fast detection of relevant feature subsets using the technique of constrained feature subsets. Compared to the traditional greedy methods the gain in speed can be up to one order of magnitude, with results being comparable or even better than the greedy methods. This makes it a very practical solution for classification tasks that can be solved using a relatively small amount of discriminative features (or feature dependencies), but where the initial set of potential discriminative features is rather large.",2003

In this paper, we first attempt to enhance the performance of GEDA by improving its model estimation method. The new estimation method shifts the weighted mean of high-quality solutions towards the fitness improvement direction and estimates the covariance matrix by taking the shifted mean as the center. Theoretical analyses show that the new covariance matrix is essentially a rank-one modification (R1M) of the original one. It could effectively adjust both the search scope and the search direction of GEDA, and thus improving the search efficiency. Furthermore, considering the importance of the population size tuning in GEDA, we develop a population reduction (PR) strategy which linearly reduces the population size throughout the evolution. By this means, the exploration and exploitation ability of GEDA could be balanced better in different search stages and a more proper utilization of limited computation resource can be achieved.

Such algorithms sample the new generation from a probabilistic model of promising solutions. The search space of the optimization problem is improved by such probabilistic models. In the Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA), the set of promising solutions forms a Bayesian network and the new solutions are sampled from the built Bayesian network. This paper proposes a novel real-coded stochastic BOA for continuous global optimization by utilizing a stochastic Bayesian network. In the proposed algorithm, the new Bayesian network takes advantage of using a stochastic structure (that there is a probability distribution function for each edge in the network) and the new generation is sampled from the stochastic structure. In order to generate a new solution, some new structure, and therefore a new Bayesian network is sampled from the current stochastic structure and the new solution will be produced from the sampled Bayesian network. Due to the stochastic structure used in the sampling phase, each sample can be generated based on a different structure. Therefore the different dependency structures can be preserved. Before the new generation is generated, the stochastic network's probability distributions are updated according to the fitness evaluation of the current generation. The proposed method is able to take advantage of using different dependency structures through the sampling phase just by using one stochastic structure.

The PBIL algorithm is an easy to understand heuristic optimization technique that is inspired by the genetic algorithm and the competitive learning paradigm. PBIL includes many of the features from the genetic algorithm such as binary string representation, the notion of individuals, fitness measures and mutations. Contrary to the genetic algorithm it does not maintain a population of individuals but instead PBIL contains a probability vector. At each generation a new population of individuals is sampled according to the probabilities specified in the probability vector. The population is evaluated and the probability vector is updated by dragging it towards the best individual in the population.

Most EDAs explicitly use the probabilistic model to sample new solutions without using traditional genetic operators. EDAs make good use of the global statistical information collected from previous searches but they do not efficiently use the location information about individual solutions. It is recently realized that global statistical information and location information should complement each other during the evolution process. In view of this, we design the Self-guided GA based on a novel strategy to combine these two kinds of information. The Self-guided GA does not sample new solutions from the probabilistic model. Instead, it estimates the quality of a candidate offspring based on the probabilistic model used in its crossover and mutation operations. In such a way, the mutation and crossover operations are able to generate fitter solutions, thus improving the performance of the algorithm. We tested the proposed algorithm by applying it to deal with the NP-complete flowshop scheduling problem to minimize the makespan.

In addition, given that the system could be non-convex, Newton or Quasi-Newton (Dogleg) based solvers get trapped on local minima. The capacity of such kinds of solvers to find an adequate solution strongly depends on the starting point. A well-known problem is the selection of such a starting point, which requires a priori information about the neighbouring region of the solution.

However, there is no firm theoretical basis for this scalability.|The aim of this paper is to carry out a theoretical analysis of the scalability of rBOA in the context of additively decomposable problems with real-valued variables. The scalability is measured by the growth of the number of fitness function evaluations (in order to reach the optimum) with the size of the problem. The total number of evaluations is computed by multiplying the population size for learning a correct probabilistic model (i.e., population complexity) and the number of generations before convergence, (i.e., convergence time complexity). Experimental results support the scalability model of rBOA. The rBOA shows a subquadratic (in problem size) scalability for uniformly scaled decomposable problems.",2008
Support condition monitoring of offshore wind turbines using model updating techniques,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000560785100004,"Xu, Y, Nikitas, G, Wang, Y","The offshore wind turbines are dynamically sensitive, whose fundamental frequency can be very close to the forcing frequencies activated by the environmental and turbine loads. Minor changes of support conditions may lead to the shift of natural frequencies, and this could be disastrous if resonance happens. To monitor the support conditions and thus to enhance the safety of offshore wind turbines, a model updating method is developed in this study. A hybrid sensing system was fabricated and set up in the laboratory to investigate the long-term dynamic behaviour of the offshore wind turbine system with monopile foundation in sandy deposits. A finite element model was constructed to simulate structural behaviours of the offshore wind turbine system. Distributed nonlinear springs and a roller boundary condition are used to model the soil-structure interaction properties. The finite element model and the test results were used to analyse the variation of the support condition of the monopile, through an finite element model updating process using estimation of distribution algorithms. The results show that the fundamental frequency of the test model increases after a period under cyclic loading, which is attributed to the compaction of the surrounding sand instead of local damage of the structure. The hybrid sensing system is reliable to detect both the acceleration and strain responses of the offshore wind turbine model and can be potentially applied to the remote monitoring of real offshore wind turbines. The estimation of distribution algorithm-based model updating technique is demonstrated to be successful for the support condition monitoring of the offshore wind turbine system, which is potentially useful for other model updating and condition monitoring applications.",2020

While the primary goal of applying EDAs is to discover the global optimum or at least its accurate approximation, besides this, any EDA provides us with a sequence of probabilistic models, which in most cases hold a great deal of information about the problem. Although using problem-specific knowledge has been shown to significantly improve performance of EDAs and other evolutionary algorithms, this readily available source of problem-specific information has been practically ignored by the EDA community. This paper takes the first step toward the use of probabilistic models obtained by EDAs to speed up the solution of similar problems in the future. More specifically, we propose two approaches to biasing model building in the hierarchical Bayesian optimization algorithm (hBOA) based on knowledge automatically learned from previous hBOA runs on similar problems. We show that the proposed methods lead to substantial speedups and argue that the methods should work well in other applications that require solving a large number of problems with similar structure.",2012

However, they show some limitations, mainly derived from an unbalanced exploration and local-search trade-off. This paper presents an estimation of distribution algorithm for grammar-guided genetic programming to overcome this difficulty and thus increase the performance of the evolutionary algorithm. Our proposal employs an extended dynamic stochastic context-free grammar to encode and calculate the estimation of the distribution of the search space from some promising individuals in the population. Unlike traditional estimation of distribution algorithms, the proposed approach improves exploratory behavior by smoothing the estimated distribution model. Therefore, this algorithm is referred to as SEDA, smoothed estimation of distribution algorithm. Experiments have been conducted to compare overall performance using a typical genetic programming crossover operator, an incremental estimation of distribution algorithm, and the proposed approach after tuning their hyperparameters. These experiments involve challenging problems to test the local search and exploration features of the three evolutionary systems. The results show that grammar-guided genetic programming with SEDA achieves the most accurate solutions with an intermediate convergence speed.",2024

Sporadic model building for efficiency enhancement of the hierarchical BOA,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000253571200004,"Pelikan, M, Sastry, K and Goldberg, DE","Efficiency enhancement techniques - such as parallelization and hybridization - are among the most important ingredients of practical applications of genetic and evolutionary algorithms and that is why this research area represents an important niche of evolutionary computation. This paper describes and analyzes sporadic model building, which can be used to enhance the efficiency of the hierarchical Bayesian optimization algorithm (hBOA) and other estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) that use complex multivariate probabilistic models. With sporadic model building, the structure of the probabilistic model is updated once in every few iterations (generations), whereas in the remaining iterations, only model parameters (conditional and marginal probabilities) are updated. Since the time complexity of updating model parameters is much lower than the time complexity of learning the model structure, sporadic model building decreases the overall time complexity of model building. The paper shows that for boundedly difficult nearly decomposable and hierarchical optimization problems, sporadic model building leads to a significant model-building speedup, which decreases the asymptotic time complexity of model building in hBOA by a factor of Theta(n(0.26)) to Theta(n(0.5)) where n is the problem size. On the other hand, sporadic model building also increases the number of evaluations until convergence; nonetheless, if model building is the bottleneck, the evaluation slowdown is insignificant compared to the gains in the asymptotic complexity of model building. The paper also presents a dimensional model to provide a heuristic for scaling the structure-building period, which is the only parameter of the proposed sporadic model-building approach. The paper then tests the proposed method and the rule for setting the structure-building period on the problem of finding ground states of 2D and 3D Ising spin glasses.",2008

Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) are a class of evolutionary algorithms which perform a two-step process: building a probabilistic model from which good solutions may be generated and then using this model to generate new individuals. Two distinct research trends that emerged in the past few years are the hybridization of PSO and EDA algorithms and the parallelization of EDAs to exploit the idea of exchanging the probabilistic model information. In this work, we propose the use of a cooperative PSO/EDA algorithm based on the exchange of heterogeneous probabilistic models. The model is heterogeneous because the cooperating PSO/EDA algorithms use different methods to sample the search space. Three different exchange approaches are tested and compared in this work. In all these approaches, the amount of information exchanged is adapted based on the performance of the two cooperating swarms.

The aim is to effectively combine particle swarm optimization (PSO) with the estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) without losing their unique features. This aim is achieved by incorporating the following mechanisms: (1) selection is applied to the local best solutions in order to obtain more promising individuals for model building, (2) a probabilistic model of the problem is built from the selected solutions, and (3) new individuals are generated by a stochastic combination of the EDA's model sampling method and the PSO's particle moving mechanism. To exhibit the utility of the EPSDA framework, an extended compact particle swarm optimization (EcPSO) is developed by combining the strengths of the extended compact genetic algorithm (EcGA) with binary PSO (BPSO), along the lines of the suggested framework. Due to its effective nature of harmonizing the global search of EcGA with the local search of BPSO, EcPSO is able to discover the optimal solution in a fast and reliable manner. Experimental results on artificial to real-world problems have adduced grounds for the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",2012

This is especially useful for black-box optimization where no assumptions are made on the problem being solved, which is characteristic of many cases in solving complex real-world problems. In this paper we consider multi-objective optimization problems with real-valued variables. Although the vast majority of advances in EDA literature concern single-objective optimization, advances have also been made in multi-objective optimization. In this paper we bring together two recent advances, namely incremental Gaussian model building to reduce the required population size and a mixture-based multi-objective framework that has specific methods to better facilitate model-building techniques that span multiple generations. Significantly faster convergence to the optimal Pareto front is achieved on 6 out of 7 artificial benchmark problems from literature. Although results on two of these problems show that building models with higher-order interactions between variables is required, these problems are still artificial. We therefore also consider a more realistic optimization problem in image processing, namely deformable image registration. For this problem too, our results show the need for processing interactions between problem variables, stressing the importance of studying the use of such models. Furthermore, the number of problem variables in the deformable image registration problem can be very large. The building of models with higher-order interactions, especially mixture-based models, then requires very large population sizes. The use of incremental model building is therefore of high importance. This claim is supported by our results that show a huge reduction in the number of required evaluations on this problem.",2012

Although MOEDAs have proved to be a valid approach, the last point is an obstacle to the achievement of a significant improvement regarding ""standard"" multi-objective optimization evolutionary algorithms. Adapting the model-building algorithm is one way to achieve a substantial advance. Most model-building schemes used so far by EDAs employ off-the-shelf machine learning methods.

However, in negotiation systems with time constraints (e.g., resource negotiations for Grid and Cloud computing), it is crucial to optimize either or both price and negotiation speed based on preferences of participants for improving efficiency and increasing utilization. To this end, this work presents the design and implementation of negotiation agents that can optimize both price and negotiation speed (for the given preference settings of these parameters) under a negotiation setting of complete information. Then, to support negotiations with incomplete information, this work deals with the problem of finding effective negotiation strategies of agents by using coevolutionary learning, which results in optimal negotiation outcomes. In the coevolutionary learning method used here, two types of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) such as conventional EDAs (S-EDAs) and novel improved dynamic diversity controlling EDAs ((IDC)-C-2-EDAs) were adopted for comparative studies. A series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance for coevolving effective negotiation strategies using the EDAs. In the experiments, each agent adopts three representative preference criteria: (1) placing more emphasis on optimizing more price, (2) placing equal emphasis on optimizing exact price and speed and (3) placing more emphasis on optimizing more speed. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the coevolutionary learning adopting (IDC)-C-2-EDAs because it generally coevolved effective converged negotiation strategies (close to the optimum) while the coevolutionary learning adopting S-EDAs often failed to coevolve such strategies within a reasonable number of generations.",2013

On the other hand factor graph which is the most natural graphical model for representing additively decomposable functions is rarely employed in EDAs.

The EDA is applied to implement such explicit learning by building a Bayesian network of the joint distribution of solutions. The conditional probability of each variable in the network is computed according to an initial set of promising solutions. Subsequently, each new instance for each variable is generated by using the corresponding conditional probabilities, until all variables have been generated, i.e. in our case, a new rule string has been obtained. Another set of rule strings will be generated in this way, some of which will replace previous strings based on fitness selection. If stopping conditions are not met, the conditional probabilities for all nodes in the Bayesian network are updated again using the current set of promising rule strings.

Recently, a GOMEA for permutation spaces was introduced by leveraging the random keys encoding, obtaining promising first results on permutation flow shop instances. A key cited strength of GOMEAs is linkage learning, i.e., the ability to determine and leverage, during optimization, key dependencies between problem variables. However, the added value of linkage learning was not tested in depth for permutation GOMEA. Here, we introduce a new version of permutation GOMEA, called qGOMEA, that works directly in permutation space, removing the redundancy of using random keys. We additionally consider various linkage information sources, including random noise, in both GOMEA variants, and compare performance with various classic genetic algorithms on a wider range of problems than considered before. We find that, although the benefits of linkage learning are clearly visible for various artificial benchmark problems, this is far less the case for various real-world inspired problems. Finally, we find that qGOMEA performs best, and is more applicable to a wider range of permutation problems.",2022

This is especially important for black-box optimization (BBO) where prior structural knowledge of a problem is not available. Existing model-based Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are very efficient at learning structure in both the discrete, and in the continuous domain. In this article, discrete and continuous model-building mechanisms are integrated for the Mixed-Integer (MI) domain, comprising discrete and continuous variables. We revisit a recently introduced model-based evolutionary algorithm for the MI domain, the Genetic Algorithm for Model-Based mixed-Integer opTimization (GAMBIT). We extend GAMBIT with a parameterless scheme that allows for practical use of the algorithm without the need to explicitly specify any parameters. We furthermore contrast GAMBIT with other model-based alternatives. The ultimate goal of processing mixed dependences explicitly in GAMBIT is also addressed by introducing a new mechanism for the explicit exploitation of mixed dependences. We find that processing mixed dependences with this novel mechanism allows for more efficient optimization. We further contrast the parameterless GAMBIT with Mixed-Integer Evolution Strategies (MIES) and other state-of-the-art MI optimization algorithms from the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) commercial algorithm suite on problems with and without constraints, and show that GAMBIT is capable of solving problems where variable dependences prevent many algorithms from successfully optimizing them.",2018

However, their major challenge is high time complexity associated with the exploration of a large search space and consequently a large number of fitness function evaluations. Moreover, the interaction between features is another key issue in FS problems, directly affecting the classification per-formance through selecting correlated features. In this paper, an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA)-based method is proposed with three important contributions. Firstly, as an extension of EDA, the proposed method in each iteration generates only two individuals competing based on a fitness function, evolving during the algorithm using our proposed update procedure. Secondly, we provide a guiding technique to determine the number of features to be selected for individuals in each iteration. As a result, the number of selected features in the final solution would be optimized during the evolution process. These two would lead to increasing the convergence speed of the algorithm. Thirdly, as the main contribution of the paper, in addition to considering the importance of each feature alone, the proposed method can consider the interaction between features, being able to deal with complementary features and consequently increase classification performance. To do this, we provide a conditional probability scheme that considers the joint probability distribution of selecting two fea-tures. The introduced probabilities successfully detect correlated features. Experimental results on a synthetic dataset with correlated features proved the performance of our proposed approach facing these types of features. Furthermore, the results on 13 real-world datasets obtained from the UCI repository showed the superiority of the proposed method in comparison with some state-of-the-art approaches.

Existing Score-Based (SB) and Independence-Based (IB) approaches must make concessions either on robustness or efficiency. IBMAP-HC improves robustness efficiently through an IB-SB hybrid approach based on the probabilistic Maximum-A-Posteriori (MAP) technique; and the IB-score, a tractable expression for computing posterior probabilities of Markov network structures. Performance is first tested against IB and SB competitors on synthetic datasets. Against IB competitors (GSMN algorithm and a version of the HHC algorithm adapted here for Markov networks discovery), IBMAP-HC showed reductions in edges Hamming distance with same order running times. Against SB competitors, both IBMAP-HC and our adaptation of HHC produced comparable Hamming distances, but with running times orders of magnitude faster. We also evaluated IBMAP-HC in a realistic, challenging testbed: EDAs, evolutionary algorithms for optimization that estimate a distribution on each generation. Using IBMAP-HC to estimate distributions, EDAs converged to the optimum faster in all benchmark functions considered, reducing required fitness evaluations by up to 80%.",2011

This work investigates different sampling mechanisms of HMOBEDA, applying the considered approaches to two different combinatorial MaOPs. Moreover, the paper provides a broad set of statistical analyses on its PGM model. These analyses have been carried out to evaluate how the interactions among variables, objectives and local search parameters are captured by the model and how information collected from different runs can be aggregated and explored in a Probabilistic Pareto Front. In experiments, two variants of HMOBEDA are compared with the original version, each one with a different set of evidences fixed during the sampling process. Results for instances of multi-objective knapsack problem with 2-5 and 8 objectives show that the best variant outperforms the original HMOBEDA in terms of convergence and diversity in the solution set.

To answer this question, the convergence process is separated into three phases and it is shown that for each phase, a preferable strategy exists for setting the variances. It is highly likely that the use of variances that have been estimated with maximum likelihood is not optimal. Thus, variance modification policies are not just a nice add-on.

A copula-based estimation of distribution algorithm for calibration of microscopic traffic models,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000457666200026,"Fard, MR and Mohaymany, AS","The importance of calibration of microscopic traffic models as the main core of traffic simulation software results from the need for more realistic traffic behaviors. The latent essence of several parameters in such models as well as the uncertainties resulting from the noise in the data, make the process of calibration much more complex. Usually, the calibration process is formulated as an optimization problem. Selecting the appropriate solution algorithm due to nonlinear and non convex nature of the problem is crucial. The importance of the issue is more significant when the matter of calibrating the medium or large-scale simulation model is considered. This is mainly due to the expensive cost that running the simulation models impose. Therefore, applying the current algorithms in which finding the appropriate solutions requires a large number of simulation runs is not deemed suitable. In this paper, an estimation of distribution algorithm based on copula theory has been suggested. In contrast with traditional solution algorithms, in the proposed algorithm complex interaction between parameters of a model has been considered by constructing and sampling from a copula-based probabilistic model. Copulas are functions that describe the dependence structure of a set of random variables and connect multivariate distribution functions to one-dimensional marginal distribution functions. The results indicate that applying an explicit probabilistic model based on copula helps the estimation of distribution algorithm to explore the search space more effectively and efficiently as well as provides the possibility of extracting the knowledge with regard to the structure of the calibration problem through analyzing the probabilistic models that are constructed during the evolution process. Furthermore, this new algorithm has been compared with the genetic algorithm and kernel-based cross-entropy method on synthetic and real trajectory data. The results confirm that the proposed algorithm is more efficient in terms of convergence rate, resource usage and more robust in terms of the probability of finding the global optimal solution.",2019

Upper Bounds on the Running Time of the Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm on OneMax,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000458280100011,"Witt, C","The Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm (UMDA) is a randomized search heuristic that builds a stochastic model of the underlying optimization problem by repeatedly sampling. solutions and adjusting the model according to the best mu samples. We present a running time analysis of the UMDA on the classical OneMax benchmark function for wide ranges of the parameters mu and lambda. If mu >= c log n for some constant c > 0 and lambda = (1+ Theta(1)) mu, we obtain a general bound O (mu n) on the expected running time. This bound crucially assumes that all marginal probabilities of the algorithm are confined to the interval [1/n, 1 - 1/n]. If mu >= c' root n log n for a constant c' > 0 and lambda = (1 + Theta(1)) mu, the behavior of the algorithm changes and the bound on the expected running time becomes O(mu root n), which typically holds even if the borders on the marginal probabilities are omitted.

Most of the times the direct kinematics problem involves the solution of a system of non-linear equations. The most efficient methods to solve such kind of equations assume convexity in a cost function which minimum is the solution of the non-linear system. In consequence, the capacity of such methods depends on the knowledge about an starting point which neighboring region is convex, hence the method can find the global minimum. This article propose a method based on probabilistic learning about an adequate starting point for the Dogleg method which assumes local convexity of the function. The proposed method efficiently avoids the local minima, without need of human intervention or apriori knowledge, thus it shows a more robust performance than the simple Dogleg method or other gradient based methods. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed hybrid method, numerical experiments and the respective discussion are presented. The proposal can be extended to other structures of closed-kinematics chains, to the general solution of systems of non-linear equations, and to the minimization of non-linear functions.

SL-ENDA uses an RL-agent to decide upon the next population mean while approaching the rest of the algorithm as the environment. A comparison of SL-ENDA to AMaLGaM and CMA-ES on unimodal noiseless functions shows mostly comparable performance and scalability to the broadly used and carefully manually crafted algorithms.

In this paper, we propose and analyze UMM, an estimation-of-distribution (EDA) algorithm based on a Mallows probabilistic model and unbalanced rank aggregation (uBorda). Experimental results on black-box versions of LOP and PFSP show that UMM outperforms the solutions obtained by CEGO, a Bayesian optimization algorithm for combinatorial optimization. Nevertheless, a slight modification to CEGO, based on the different interpretations for rankings and orderings, significantly improves its performance, thus producing solutions that are slightly better than those of UMM and dramatically better than the original version. Another benefit of UMM is that its computational complexity increases linearly with both the number of function evaluations and the permutation size, which results in computation times an order of magnitude shorter than CEGO, making it specially useful when both computation time and number of evaluations are limited.",2021

When done properly, such scaling has been shown to prevent premature convergence on slope-like regions of the search space. In this paper we specifically focus on one way of scaling that was previously introduced as Adaptive Variance Scaling (ANTS.). It was found that when using ANTS, the average number of fitness evaluations grows subquadratically with the dimensionality on a wide range of unimodal test-problems, competitively with the CMA-ES. Still, room for improvement exists because the. variance doesn't always have to be scaled. A previously introduced trigger based oil correlation that determines when to apply scaling was shown to fail on higher dimensional problems. Here we provide a new solution called the Standard-Deviation Ratio (SDR.) trigger that is integrated with the Iterated Density-Estimation Evolutionary Algorithm (IDEA). Intuitively put, scaling is triggered with SDR only if improvements are found to be far away from the mean. SDR, works even in high dimensions as a result of factorizing the decision rule behind the trigger according to the estimated Bayesian factorization.

They are able to take advantage of correlation structure to drive the search more efficiently, and they are able to provide insights about the structure of the search space. However, model building in high dimensions is extremely challenging, and as a result existing EDAs may become less attractive in large-scale problems because of the associated large computational requirements. Large-scale continuous global optimisation is key to many modern-day real-world problems. Scaling up EAs to large-scale problems has become one of the biggest challenges of the field. This paper pins down some fundamental roots of the problem and makes a start at developing a new and generic framework to yield effective and efficient EDA-type algorithms for large-scale continuous global optimisation problems. Our concept is to introduce an ensemble of random projections to low dimensions of the set of fittest search points as a basis for developing a new and generic divide-and-conquer methodology. Our ideas are rooted in the theory of random projections developed in theoretical computer science, and in developing and analysing our framework we exploit some recent results in nonasymptotic random matrix theory.",2016
Hybrid Feature Selection and Peptide Binding Affinity Prediction using an EDA based Algorithm,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000326235302051,"Shelke, K, Jayaraman, S, Valadi, J","Protein function prediction is an important problem in functional genomics. Typically, protein sequences are represented by feature vectors. A major problem of protein datasets that increase the complexity of classification models is their large number of features. The process of drug discovery often involves the use of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to identify chemical structures that could have good inhibitory effects on specific targets and have low toxicity (non-specific activity). QSAR models are regression or classification models used in the chemical and biological sciences. Because of high dimensionality problems, a feature selection problem is imminent. In this study, we thus employ a hybrid Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) based filter-wrapper methodology to simultaneously extract informative feature subsets and build robust QSAR models. The performance of the algorithm was tested on the benchmark classification challenge datasets obtained from the CoePRa competition platform, developed in 2006. Our results clearly demonstrate the efficacy of a hybrid EDA filter-wrapper algorithm in comparison to the results reported earlier.",2013
Unveiling relevant non-motor Parkinson's disease severity symptoms using a machine learning approach,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000322298900007,"Arma√±anzas, R, Bielza, C, Larra√±aga, P","Objective: Is it possible to predict the severity staging of a Parkinson's disease (PD) patient using scores of non-motor symptoms? This is the kickoff question for a machine learning approach to classify two widely known PD severity indexes using individual tests from a broad set of non-motor PD clinical scales only.|Methods: The Hoehn & Yahr index and clinical impression of severity index are global measures of PD severity. They constitute the labels to be assigned in two supervised classification problems using only non-motor symptom tests as predictor variables. Such predictors come from a wide range of PD symptoms, such as cognitive impairment, psychiatric complications, autonomic dysfunction or sleep disturbance. The classification was coupled with a feature subset selection task using an advanced evolutionary algorithm, namely an estimation of distribution algorithm.|Results: Results show how five different classification paradigms using a wrapper feature selection scheme are capable of predicting each of the class variables with estimated accuracy in the range of 72-92%. In addition, classification into the main three severity categories (Mild, moderate and severe) was split into dichotomic problems where binary classifiers perform better and select different subsets of non-motor symptoms. The number of jointly selected symptoms throughout the whole process was low, suggesting a link between the selected non-motor symptoms and the general severity of the disease.|Conclusion: Quantitative results are discussed from a medical point of view, reflecting a clear translation to the clinical manifestations of PD. Moreover, results include a brief panel of non-motor symptoms that could help clinical practitioners to identify patients who are at different stages of the disease from a limited set of symptoms, such as hallucinations, fainting, inability to control body sphincters or believing in unlikely facts.

Improving DSMGA-II Performance on Hierarchical Problems by Introducing Preservative Back Mixing,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:001035469400134,"Ngai, CM and Yu, TL","Inspired from the optimal mixing in the linkage tree gene-pool optimal mixing evolutionary algorithm, the dependent structure matrix genetic algorithm II (DSMGA-II) is one of the state-of-the-art model-building genetic algorithms. It obtains the patterns from successful restricted mixing and uses them during the back mixing (BM) to remove spurious linkage information such that the linkage information in need stands out. However, such techniques can be misled in hierarchical problems where the linkages in latter layers are mistreated as spurious in BM. There has been diversity preservation scheme developed for DSMGA-II by monitoring the entropy, but such technique impairs the exploration ability of DSMGA-II on plateau. To solve this issue, this paper proposes the preservative back mixing (PBM), a modified version of BM. Specifically, PBM features (i) the adaptive back mixing that automatically adjusts the power of BM and (ii) the linkage preservation that preserves the linkages among complementary patterns.

We study the intricate dynamics of the cGA on the test function OneMax, and how its performance depends on the hypothetical population size K, which determines how quickly decisions about promising bit values are fixated in the probabilistic model. It is known that the cGA and the Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm (UMDA), a related algorithm whose population size is called lambda, run in expected time O(nlogn) when the population size is just large enough (K=Theta(nlogn) and lambda=Theta(nlogn) , respectively) to avoid wrong decisions being fixated. The UMDA also shows the same performance in a very different regime (lambda=Theta(logn), equivalent to K=Theta(logn) in the cGA) with much smaller population size, but for very different reasons: many wrong decisions are fixated initially, but then reverted efficiently. If the population size is even smaller (o(logn)), the time is exponential. We show that population sizes in between the two optimal regimes are worse as they yield larger runtimes: we prove a lower bound of omega(K1/3n+nlogn) for the cGA on OneMax for K=O(n/log2n). For K=omega(log3n) the runtime increases with growing K before dropping again to O(Kn+nlogn) for K=omega(nlogn) .

Techniques in literature for dynamic optimization involve tracking one or more peaks moving in a sequential manner through the parameter space. However, many practical applications in, e. g., video and image processing involve optimizing a stream of recurrent problems, subject to noise. In such cases, rather than tracking one or more moving peaks, the focus is on managing a memory of solutions along with information allowing to associate these solutions with their respective problem instances. In this paper, Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) of Dynamic Particle Swarm Optimization (DPSO) solutions is proposed for fast optimization of streams of recurrent problems. In order to avoid costly re-optimizations over time, a compact density representation of previously-found DPSO solutions is created through mixture modeling in the optimization space, and stored in memory. For proof of concept simulation, the proposed hybrid GMM-DPSO technique is employed to optimize embedding parameters of a bi-tonal watermarking system on a heterogeneous database of document images.

DAE-LSTMs are artificial neural networks that first learn the properties of a parent population by mapping promising candidate solutions to a latent space and reconstructing the candidate solutions from the latent space. The trained model is then used to sample new offspring solutions. We show on a generalization of the royal tree problem that DAE-GP outperforms standard GP and that performance differences increase with higher problem complexity. Furthermore, DAE-GP is able to create offspring with higher fitness from a learned model in comparison to standard GP. We believe that the key reason for the high performance of DAE-GP is that we do not impose any assumptions about the relationships between learned variables which is different to previous EDA-GP models. Instead, DAE-GP flexibly identifies and models relevant dependencies of promising candidate solutions.",2020

In this paper, we present the latest version of, and propose substantial enhancements to, the gene-pool optimal mixing evolutionary algorithm (GOMEA): an EA explicitly designed to estimate and exploit linkage information. We begin by performing a large-scale search over several GOMEA design choices to understand what matters most and obtain a generally best-performing version of the algorithm. Next, we introduce a novel version of GOMEA, called CGOMEA, where linkage-based variation is further improved by filtering solution mating based on conditional dependencies. We compare our latest version of GOMEA, the newly introduced CGOMEA, and another contending linkage-aware EA, DSMGA-II, in an extensive experimental evaluation, involving a benchmark set of nine black-box problems that can be solved efficiently only if their inherent dependency structure is unveiled and exploited. Finally, in an attempt to make EAs more usable and resilient to parameter choices, we investigate the performance of different automatic population management schemes for GOMEA and CGOMEA, de facto making the EAs parameterless. Our results show that GOMEA and CGOMEA significantly outperform the original GOMEA and DSMGA-II on most problems, setting a new state of the art for the field",2024

In this paper, a Genetic Algorithm using both Multiploid representation and the Bayesian Decision method is proposed. By Multiploid representation, an implicit memory scheme is introduced to transfer useful information to the next generations. In this representation, there are more than one genotypes and only one phenotype. The phenotype values are determined based on the corresponding genotypes values. To determine phe-notype values, the well-known Bayesian Optimization Algorithm (BOA) has been injected into our algo-rithm to create a Bayes Network by using the previous population to exploit interactions between variables. With this algorithm, we have solved the well-known Dynamic Knapsack Problem (DKP) with 100, 250, and 500 items. Also, we have compared our algorithm with the most recent algorithm in the literature by using the DKP with 100 items. Experiments have shown that the proposed algorithm is effi-cient and faster than the peer algorithms in the manner of tracking moving optima without using an explicit memory scheme. In conclusion, using relationships between variables within the optimization algorithms is useful when concerning dynamic environments.(c) 2022 Karabuk University.

Since optimal negotiation strategies ensure that interacting agents negotiate optimally, finding such strategies-particularly, for the agents having incomplete information about their opponents-is an important and challenging issue to support agent-based automated negotiation systems. To address this issue, we consider the problem of finding optimal negotiation strategies for a bilateral negotiation between self-interested agents with incomplete information through an EDA-based coevolution mechanism. Due to the competitive nature of the agents, EDAs should be able to deal with competitive coevolution based on two asymmetric populations each consisting of self-interested agents. However, finding optimal negotiation solutions via coevolutionary learning using conventional EDAs is difficult because the EDAs suffer from premature convergence and their search capability deteriorates during coevolution. To solve these problems, even though we have previously devised the dynamic diversity controlling EDA ((DC)-C-2-EDA), which is mainly characterized by a diversification and refinement (DR) procedure, (DC)-C-2-EDA suffers from the population reinitialization problem that leads to a computational overhead. To reduce the computational overhead and to achieve further improvements in terms of solution accuracy, we have devised an improved (DC)-C-2-EDA ((IDC)-C-2-EDA) by adopting an enhanced DR procedure and a local neighborhood search (LNS) method. Favorable empirical results support the effectiveness of the proposed (IDC)-C-2-EDA compared to conventional and the other proposed EDAs.

Although several extensions of CMAES to multi-objective (MO) optimization exist, no extension incorporates a key component of the most robust and general CMA-ES variant: the association of a population with each Gaussian distribution that drives optimization. To achieve this, we use a recently introduced framework for extending population-based algorithms from single- to multi-objective optimization. We compare, using six well-known benchmark problems, the performance of the newly constructed MO-CMA- ES with existing variants and with the estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) known as iMAMaLGaM, that is also an instance of the framework, extending the single- objective EDA iAMaLGaM to MO. Results underline the advantages of being able to use populations. Because many real-world problems have constraints, we also study the use of four constraint-handling techniques. We find that CMA-ES is typically less robust to these techniques than iAMaLGaM. Moreover, whereas we could verify that a penalty method that was previously used in literature leads to fast convergence, we also find that it has a high risk of finding only nearly, but not entirely, feasible solutions. We therefore propose that other constraint-handling techniques should be preferred in general.",2014

First, a composite fitness function containing the information cif folding structure core (I-I-core) is introduced to replace the traditional fitness function of HP model. The proposed fitness function is expected to select better individuals for the probabilistic model of EDA. Second, local search with guided operators is utilized to refine the found solutions for improving the efficiency of EDA. Third, an improved backtracking-based repairing method is proposed to repair invalid individuals sampled by the probabilistic model of EDA. It can significantly reduce the number of backtracking searching operation and the computational cost for a long-sequence protein.

That updating of p arises as the optimization of a functional of p. The functional is chosen so that any p that optimizes it should be p peaked about good solutions. The PC approach has deep connections with both game theory and statistical physics. We review the PC approach using its motivation as the information theoretic formulation of bounded rationality for multi-agent systems (MAS). It is then compared with GA's on a diverse set of problems. To handle high dimensional surfaces, in the PC method investigated here p is restricted to a product distribution. Each distribution in that product is controlled by a separate agent. The test functions were selected for their difficulty using either traditional gradient descent or genetic algorithms. On those functions the PC-based approach significantly outperforms traditional GA's in both rate of descent, trapping in false minima, and long term optimization.",2005

To facilitate inverse modeling, the multivariate inverse function is decomposed into a group of uni-variate functions, where the number of inverse models is reduced using a random grouping technique.

Adaptive estimated maximum-entropy distribution model,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000247393000006,"Tan, L and Taniar, D","Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) model is an optimization procedure through learning and sampling a conditional probabilistic function. The use of conditional density function permits multivariate dependency modelling, which is not captured in a population-based representation, like the classical Genetic Algorithms. The Gaussian model is a simple and widely used model for density estimation. However, an assumption of normality is not realistic for many real-life problems. Alternatively, the maximum-entropy model can be used, which makes no assumption of a normal distribution. One disadvantage of the maximum-entropy model is the learning cost of its parameters. This paper proposes an A daptiue Estimated Maximurn-Entropy Distribution (Adaptive MEED) model, which aims to reduce learning complexity of building a model. Adaptive MEED exploits the fact that samples have a low average fitness in the early stage, but they gradually converge to an optima towards the end of the search. Hence, it is not necessary to inference the model with a fall account of observed constraints in the early stage of the search. The proposed model attempts to estimate the density function with a dynamic set of samples and active constraints. In addition, the proposed model includes a global sampling function to address the issue of a missing mutation operator. The ergodic convergence properties ot""the proposed model are discussed with the Markov Chain analysis. The preliminary experimental evaluation shows that the proposed model performs well against genetic algorithms on several clustering problems. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",2007

In recent years, several approaches that use metaheuristic search techniques to automatically obtain the test inputs have been proposed. Although work in this field is very active, little attention has been paid to the selection of an appropriate search space. The present work describes an alternative to this issue. More precisely, two approaches which employ an Estimation of Distribution Algorithm as the metaheuristic technique are explained. In both cases, different regions are considered in the search for the test inputs. Moreover, to depart from a region near to the one containing the optimum, the definition of the initial search space incorporates static information extracted from the source code of the software under test. If this information is not enough to complete the definition, then a grid search method is used. According to the results of the experiments conducted, it is concluded that this is a promising option that can be used to enhance the test data generation process.",2008

Motivated by these advances, in this paper we introduce a Thurstone order statistics model, called Plackett-Luce, to the framework of estimation of distribution algorithms. In order to prove the potential of the proposed algorithm, we consider two different permutation problems: the linear ordering problem and the flowshop scheduling problem. In addition, the results are compared with those obtained by the Mallows and the Generalized Mallows proposals. Conducted experiments demonstrate that the Plackett-Luce model is the best performing model for solving the linear ordering problem.

This advantage, however, could lead to premature convergence of EDAs as the probabilistic models are no longer generating diversified solutions. In our previous research [1], we have presented the evidences that EDAs suffer from the drawback of premature convergency, thus several important guidelines are provided for the design of effective EDAs.

This allows an easy parallelization and leads to a high utilization of parallel architectures. The probabilistic model of the parallel version and the version on a single core are identical. We explore the speedups gained from running RBM-EDA on a Graphics Processing Unit. For problems of bounded difficulty like deceptive traps, parallel RBM-EDA is faster by several orders of magnitude (up to 750 times) in comparison to a single-threaded implementation on a CPU. As the speedup grows linearly with problem size, parallel RBM-EDA may be particularly useful for large problems.",2014

The concept of near decomposability is central to the study of complex systems. When little a priori information is available, a black box problem solver is needed to optimize these hierarchical problems. The solver should be able to learn linkage information, and to preserve and test partial solutions at different levels in the hierarchy. Two well known benchmark functions - shuffled Hierarchical If-And-Only-If (HIFF) and shuffled Hierarchical Trap (HTRAP) functions - exemplify the challenges posed by hierarchical problems. Standard genetic algorithms are unable to solve these problems, and specific methods, like SEAM and hBOA, have been designed to address them. In this paper, we investigate how the recently developed Linkage Tree Genetic Algorithm (LTGA) performs on these hierarchical problems. We compare LTGA with SEAM and hBOA on HIFF and HTRAP functions. Results show that, although LTGA is a simple algorithm compared to SEAM and hBOA, it nevertheless is a very efficient, reliable, and scalable algorithm for solving the randomly shuffled versions of HIFF and HTRAP, two hard, hierarchical problems.",2013

In this situation, we have to build surrogate models based on offline historical data, which is known as offline data-driven optimization. Since no new data can be used to improve the surrogate models, offline data-driven optimization remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a Gaussian process assisted offline estimation of multivariate Gaussian distribution algorithm to address the offline data-driven optimization problem. Instead of using surrogate models to predict the fitness values of individuals, we utilize a surrogate model to predict the rankings of individuals based on the frequently used lower confidence bound. In this way, the robustness of the proposed algorithm could be enhanced. Experiments are conducted on five commonly used benchmark problems.

A Dual-Purpose Memory Approach for Dynamic Particle Swarm Optimization of Recurrent Problems,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000369153300015,"Vellasques, E, Sabourin, R and Granger, E","In a dynamic optimization problem (DOP) the optima can change either in a sequential or in a recurrent manner. In sequential DOPs, the optima change gradually over time while in recurrent DOPs, previous optima reappear over time. The common strategy to tackle recurrent DOPs is to employ an archive of solutions along with information allowing to associate them with their respective problem instances. In this paper, a memory-based Dynamic Particle Swarm Optimization (DPSO) approach which relies on a dual-purpose memory for fast optimization of streams of recurrent problems is proposed. The dual-purpose memory is based on a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) of candidate solutions estimated in the optimization space which provides a compact representation of previously-found PSO solutions. This GMM is estimated over time during the optimization phase. Such memory operates in two modes: generative and regression. When operating in generative mode, the memory produces solutions that in many cases allow avoiding costly re optimizations over time. When operating in regression mode, the memory replaces costly fitness evaluations with Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR). For proof of concept simulation, the proposed hybrid GMM-DPSO technique is employed to optimize embedding parameters of a bi-tonal watermarking system on a heterogeneous database of document images. Results indicate that the computational burden of this watermarking problem is reduced by up to 90.4 % with negligible impact on accuracy. Results involving the use of the memory of GMMs in regression mode as a mean of replacing fitness evaluations (surrogate-based optimization) indicate that such learned memory also provides means of decreasing computational burden in situations where re-optimization cannot be avoided.",2016

Information about linkage identifies a subgroup of genes that are found dependent on each other. If such information is precise and properly used, it may significantly improve a method's effectiveness. The recent research shows that to solve problems with so-called overlapping blocks, it is not enough to use linkage of high quality - it is also necessary to use many different linkages that are diverse. Taking into account that the overlapping nature of problem structure is typical for practical problems, it is important to propose methods that are capable of gathering many different linkages (preferably of high quality) to keep them diverse. One of such methods is a Parameter-less Population Pyramid (P3) that was shown highly effective for overlapping problems in binary domains. Since P3 does not apply to permutation optimization problems, we propose a new P3-based method to fill this gap.

It is a necessary process for optimizing the hard problems that can not be optimized randomly via common recombination operators of simple genetic algorithm.

We call this graph 'the underlying dependency graph of the problem' (UDGP). Maximum spanning tree (MST) of the UDGP is then found. It is shown that MST contains all the necessary linkages if the dependency graph is built upon sufficient population. In this approach, pairwise dependencies that are mutual information between each pair of variables, are used to find linkage information.

The speedup provided by the surrogate increases with the number of substructures, substructure complexity, and noise-to-signal ratio.",2006
Initial breeding value prediction on Manchego sheep by using rule-based systems,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000244110600010,"delaOssa, L, Flores, MJ, Puerta, JM","In this paper we present an application of rule-based expert systems to a farming problem. Concretely the prediction of the breeding value in Manchego ewes is studied for the early stage of their life in which the standard (BLUP) methodology cannot be applied. In this case the pedigree index (arithmetical mean between parents' breeding value) is used to make the estimation. An alternative to this method is presented here, which is based on the use of two different types of rule-based systems: regression rules and linguistic fuzzy rules. The approach proposed is data-driven in the sense that the rules are learnt from data. The results obtained show that the learnt systems are more accurate than the pedigree index, especially for the regression rules case. On the other hand, the linguistic fuzzy rules systems are more easier to understand for human experts, and this is a point to be take into account because of the nature of the problem we are dealing with.

Extracted global structure makes local building block processing effective in XCS,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000242040700099,"Butz, MV, Pelikan, M, Goldberg, DE","Michigan-style learning classifier systems (LCSs), such as the accuracy-based XCS system, evolve distributed problem solutions represented by a population of rules. Recently, it was shown that decomposable problems may require effective processing of subsets of problem attributes, which cannot be generally assured with standard crossover operators. A number of competent crossover operators capable of effective identification and processing of arbitrary subsets of variables or string positions were proposed for genetic and evolutionary algorithms. This paper effectively introduces two competent crossover operators to XCS by incorporating techniques from competent genetic algorithms (GAs): the extended compact CA (ECGA) and the Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA). Instead of applying standard crossover operators, here a probabilistic model of the global population is built and sampled to generate offspring classifiers locally. Various offspring generation methods are introduced and evaluated. Results indicate that the performance of the proposed learning classifier systems XCS/ECGA and XCS/BOA is similar to that of XCS with informed crossover operators that is given all information about problem structure on input and exploits this knowledge using problem-specific crossover operators.",2005

Several different versions of this algorithm have been proposed and are shown to work well in a number of different optimisation problems. One of the key similarities between all of the DEUM algorithms proposed so far is that they all assume the interaction between variables in the problem to be pre given. In other words, they do not learn the structure of the problem and assume that it is known in advance. Therefore, they may not be classified as full estimation of distribution algorithms. This work presents a fully multivariate DEUM algorithm that can automatically learn the undirected structure of the problem, automatically find the cliques from the structure and automatically estimate a joint probability model of the Markov network. This model is then sampled using Monte Carlo samplers. The proposed DEUM algorithm can be applied to any general optimisation problem even when the structure is not known.",2009

In general, a Boltzmannian system describes a macrostate from the statistics of the constituent microstate where the minimum energy is the most probable. If we model an optimization problem as a Boltzmann process, the global optimum would be the most probable state. To achieve this, we propose an analytical derivation of the minimum distance to the Boltzmann distribution using the parameters and to fit this model. As a case study, we implemented the J-SIGMA methodology on three families of population-based metaheuristics: Swarm, Evolutionary, and Estimation of Distribution, and used a set of continuous optimization functions from CEC'17 to evaluate their performance against other metaheuristics of each family. Finally, from a statistical analysis of the convergence performance, the evidence is shown to affirm that the J-SIGMA methodology can significantly improve the convergence performance of the algorithms, regardless of the metaheuristic family to which it belongs.",2022

So, recently, the model-based evolutionary algorithms (MBEAs) have been suggested in three groups: The estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), surrogate assisted evolutionary algorithms, and the inversed models to map from the objective space to the decision space. In this article, a new approach, based on an inversed model of Gaussian process and random forest framework, is proposed. The main idea is applying the process of random forest variable importance with a random grouping that determines some of the best assignment of decision variables to objective functions in order to form a Gaussian process in inverse models that maps to decision space the rich solutions which are discovered from objective space. Then these inverse models through sampling the objective space generate offspring.

The potential benefits of this procedure are faster and easier learning process as well as the generation of more compact and human-readable classifiers. The dimensionality reduction procedure we propose consists on the reduction of the, 20-letter amino acid (AA) alphabet, which is normally used to specify a protein sequence, into a lower cardinality alphabet. This reduction comes about by a clustering of AA types accordingly to their physical and chemical similarity. Our automated reduction procedure is guided by a fitness function based on the Mutual Information between the AA-based input attributes of the dataset and the protein structure feature that being predicted.|To search for the optimal reduction, the Extended Compact Genetic Algorithm (ECGA) was used, and afterwards the results of this process were fed into (and validated by) BioHEL, a genetics-based machine learning technique. BioHEL used the reduced alphabet to induce rules for protein structure prediction features. BioHEL results are compared to two standard machine learning systems. Our results show that it is possible to reduce the size of the alphabet used for prediction from twenty to just three letters resulting in more compact, i.e. interpretable, rules. Also, a protein-wise accuracy performance measure suggests that the loss of accuracy acrued by this substantial alphabet reduction is not statistically significant when compared to the full alphabet.",2007

From the estimated distribution of the algorithm, a feature ranking is derived. Afterwards this ranking is used to iteratively discard features. We apply this technique to the problem of splice site prediction, and show how it can be used to gain insight into the underlying biological process of splicing.|Conclusion: We show that this technique proves to be more robust than the traditional use of estimation of distribution algorithms for feature selection: instead of returning a single best subset of features ( as they normally do) this method provides a dynamical view of the feature selection process, like the traditional sequential wrapper methods.

The aim of this payer is to propose the parallel version of this algorithm where the optimization time decreases linearly with the number of processors. During the parallel construction of network, the explicit topological ordering of variables is used to keep the model acyclic.

It iteratively draws solutions from its model and, considering their fitnesses, uses these solutions to update the model's parameters. However, there is a risk of reinforcing random noise from sampling back into the model-a problem termed genetic drift. We propose the competing genes evolutionary algorithm that optimizes a fitness function over a binary search space and avoids this problem by updating only one model parameter at a time. The algorithm uses the model not only to sample solutions but also to select a parameter in each iteration that it pins to a value for the rest of the search process. We obtain upper bounds on the number of fitness evaluations the algorithm needs to solve well-known benchmark functions as a function of its population size and observe better or comparable results to other evolutionary algorithms. We attribute these favorable results to the algorithm's efficient use of its samples to explore its dwindling search space. We also introduce two variants of the algorithm. The first version eliminates the need to preset the number of solutions to sample per iteration, and the second seeks to escape local optima.

Although some work has been done in this area, most of the approaches are adaptations of EDAs designed for problems based on integer or real domains, and only a few algorithms have been specifically designed to deal with permutation-based problems. In this paper, we present an EDA that learns probability distributions over permutations. Particularly, our approach is based on the use of k-order marginals. In addition, we carry out some preliminary experiments over classical permutation-based problems in order to study the performance of the proposed k-order marginals EDA.",2011

The former has fast convergence rate and strong global search capability, but is easily trapped in local optimum. The latter has good local search capability with slower convergence speed. Therefore, a new hybrid optimization algorithm which combines the merits of both algorithms, a hybrid optimization algorithm based on chaotic differential evolution and estimation of distribution (cDE/EDA) was proposed. Due to its effective nature of harmonizing the global search of EDA with the local search of DE, the proposed algorithm can discover the optimal solution in a fast and reliable manner. Chaotic policy was used to strengthen the search ability of DE. Meantime the global convergence of algorithm was analyzed with the aid of limit theorem of monotone bounded sequence. The proposed algorithm was tested through a set of typical benchmark problems. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed cDE/EDA algorithm.",2017

The proposed method uses the univariate marginal distribution model to infer statistical dependencies between the control points on different active contours. These contours have been generated through an alignment process of reference shape priors, in order to increase the exploration and exploitation capabilities regarding different interactive segmentation techniques. This proposed method is applied in the segmentation of the hollow core in microscopic images of photonic crystal fibers and it is also used to segment the human heart and ventricular areas from datasets of computed tomography and magnetic resonance images, respectively. Moreover, to evaluate the performance of the medical image segmentations compared to regions outlined by experts, a set of similarity measures has been adopted.

The behavior of a versatile QEA relatively to three classical EDAs is extensively studied and comparatively good results are reported in terms of loss of diversity, scalability, solution quality, and robustness to fitness noise. To better understand QEA, two main advantages of the multimodel approach are analyzed in details.

Among the additional attributes provided by the Bayesian framework inserted into an immune-inspired search algorithm are the automatic control of the population size along the search and the inherent ability to promote and preserve diversity among the candidate solutions.

Inspired by the ideas from estimation of distribution algorithms, M-MOEA uses a probability model to capture the regularity of the distribution of the Pareto optimal solutions. The Local Principal Component Analysis(Local PCA) and the least-squares method are employed for building the model. New solutions are sampled from the model thus built. At alternate generations, M-MOEA uses crossover and mutation to produce new solutions. The selection in M-MOEA is the same as in Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II(NSGA-II).

MP-EDA: A Robust Estimation of Distribution Algorithm with Multiple Probabilistic Models for Global Continuous Optimization,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000289185200009,"Zhong, JH, Zhang, J and Fan, Z","Extending Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) to the continuous field is a promising and challenging task. With a single probabilistic model, most existing continuous EDAs usually suffer from the local stagnation or a low convergence speed. This paper presents an enhanced continuous EDA with multiple probabilistic models (MP-EDA). In the MP-EDA, the population is divided into two subpopulations. The one involved by histogram model is used to roughly capture the global optima, whereas the other involved by Gaussian model is aimed at finding highly accurate solutions. During the evolution, a migration operation is periodically carried out to exchange some best individuals of the two subpopulations. Besides, the MP-EDA adaptively adjusts the offspring size of each subpopulation to improve the searching efficiency. The effectiveness of the MP-EDA is investigated by testing ten benchmark functions. Compared with several state-of-the-art evolutionary computations, the proposed algorithm can obtain better results in most test cases.",2010

The Duple-EDA framework is proposed in which not only the current best solutions but also the search history are modeled, so that long-term feedback can be taken into account. Sample Density Balancing (SDB) is proposed under the framework to alleviate the drift phenomenon in EDA. A selection scheme based on Pareto ranking considering both the fitness and the historical sample density is adopted, which prevents the algorithm from repeatedly sampling in a small region and directs it to explore potentially optimal regions, thus helps it avoid being stuck into local optima. An MBOA (mixed Bayesian optimization algorithm) version of the framework is implemented and tested on several benchmark problems. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms a standard niching method in these benchmark problems.",2009

In this paper, we show that traditional reproduction operators such as p-uniform and n-point crossover may sabotage the functioning of diversity preservation mechanisms by producing more solutions in some areas of the objective-space than in others, i.e., they are biased. We argue that such reproductive bias is due to their high degree of disruptiveness which favors the generation of average quality offspring. Additionally, we demonstrated the impact of linkage learning in decreasing disruptiveness and reproductive bias. Such a result helps to understand the benefits of estimation of distribution algorithms in bi-objective optimization. We performed experiments on instances of the rho MNK-model, in which the use of unbiased reproduction operators was shown to work in synergy with diversity preservation mechanisms favoring the diversity of the Pareto-fronts obtained.",2019

To efficiently handle this process, unlike the standard GE that employs a simple modulo function, the probability concept is introduced to context-free grammar, thereby choosing production rules according to assigned probabilities. Moreover, any crossover and mutation are not employed for generating new individuals. Instead, along the lines of estimation of distribution algorithms that perform search using a probabilistic model of superior individuals, a new population is created/evolved from probabilistic relationship between production rules.

The model is then used to update the probability vector which is sampled to generate further populations, replacing the function of recombinative operators in a traditional genetic algorithm. DEUM uses Markov Random Field (MRF) modelling [3] to estimate the probabilistic relationship between allele values and fitness and iteratively refine a probability vector to generate better solutions.

Our previous work on Distribution Estimation using Markov networks (DEUM) has described an EDA which constructs a model of the fitness function; a unique feature of this approach is that because selective pressure is built into the model itself selection becomes optional. This paper outlines a series of experiments which make use of this property to examine the effects of selection on the population.

Recent work suggests that replacing the univariate Gaussian with a univariate Cauchy distribution in EDA holds promise in alleviating this problem because it is able to make larger jumps in the search space due to the Cauchy distribution's heavy tails. In this paper, we propose the use of a multivariate Cauchy distribution to blend together the advantages of multivariate modelling with the ability of escaping early convergence to efficiently explore the search space.

It is a universal problem that all existing Gaussian based EDAs using full covariance matrix suffer from. Through theoretical analysis with examples of simulated data and experiments, we show that the ill-posed covariance matrix strongly affects those EDAs. This paper proposes a Covariance Matrix Repairing (CMR) method to fix ill-posed covariance matrix. CMR significantly improves the robustness of EDAs.

Probabilistically Guided Prefix Gene Expression Programming,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000262048100002,"Cerny, BM, Zhou, C, Nelson, PC","Over the years there has been an increasing interest in probabilistically oriented Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), but it has not been until recently that these innovative methods have been collectively recognized and achieved an independent status. By eliminating the traditionally employed genetic operators, these probabilistic EAs have been forced to adopt an alternative approach, and in the case of Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs), probabilistic graphical models have become the favored substitute. In this paper, we propose to utilize a previously overlooked probabilistic model known as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). But preferring not to completely abandon the biologically inspired genetic operations, we largely ignore the classical learning algorithms used to train HMMs, and instead use Differential Evolution (DE) to evolve the underlying numerical parameters of the chosen probabilistic model. The evolved HMMs are then used to generate Prefix Gene Expression Programming (PGEP) chromosomes which encode candidate solutions, and thus provide feedback to guide this proposed evolutionary search process. Finally, benchmarking on a set of symbolic function regression problems has been conducted in order to compare this novel approach to the existing PGEP method.",2008

PEA is inspired by estimation of distribution algorithms and quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm, and it has a good balance between exploration and exploitation with very fast computation speed. The individual in PEA is encoded by the probability vector, defined as the smallest unit of information, for the probabilistic representation. The observation step is used in PEA to obtain the observed states of the individual, and the update operator is used to evolve the individual. In the PEA based human tracking framework, tracking is considered to be a function optimization problem, so the aim is to optimize the matching function between the model and the image observation. Since the matching function is a very complex function in high-dimensional space, PEA is used to optimize it. Experiments on 2D and 3D human motion tracking demonstrate the effectiveness, significance and computation efficiency of the proposed human tracking method. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

If an individual has a high fitness, it also has a high probability to survive and to generate offspring. Since in optimization of noisy fitness functions, the fitness of a candidate obtained is not accurate. This characteristic induces its clumsiness for noisy optimization. Compared with Darwinian-type genetic algorithms, the novel computing model Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) pay attention to analyzing the selected subpopulations, which makes it more suitable to tackle noisy optimizations. This paper first briefly introduces Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm (UMDA), and then proves that for WOneMax problem with noise, under the probability limited condition, UMDA can converge to the global optimal point. But for the limited population size, noise doesn't only delay the convergent time, but also aggravates genetic drift. Since Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm with Smoothing Filter (SUMDA) is a feasible technique to diminish genetic drift in UMDA, we adopt SUMDA to tackle noisy optimization. Numerical results show that this method is effective.",2005

The optimal scheme is very helpful for investors in making decisions. However, finding the optimal scheme is difficult and time-consuming especially when the number of assets is large and some actual investment constraints are considered. This paper proposes a new approach based on estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) for solving a cardinality constrained portfolio selection (CCPS) problem. The proposed algorithm, termed PBILCCPS, hybridizes an EDA called population-based incremental learning (PBIL) algorithm and a continuous PBIL (PBILc) algorithm, to optimize the selection of assets and the allocation of capital respectively. The proposed algorithm adopts an adaptive parameter control strategy and an elitist strategy. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with a genetic algorithm and a particle swarm optimization algorithm. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve a satisfactory result for portfolio selection and perform well in searching nondominated portfolios with high expected returns.",2010

Contemporary video processing system design is a challenging optimization problem. Generally, several video algorithms must be sequentially applied to real-time video data. Overall image quality depends on the nonlinear interactions between multiple design parameters: variable settings for each module (algorithm), the amount of data being transferred in the video processing chain as well as the order of the cascading modules. Unfortunately, no systematic techniques are currently available to configure the video chain without lengthy trial and error process. We propose a rapid and reliable method for optimization of composite video processing systems based on genetic algorithm coupled with local search heuristics. Video system configuration is evolved toward the best image quality, driven by an objective video quality metric. We analyze several local search approaches, including hill-climbing, simplex and estimation-of-distribution algorithms.

It is characterized by combining a Bayesian network and evolutionary algorithms to solve nearly decomposable optimization problems. BOA is less popularly applied to solve high dimensionality complex optimization problems. A key reason is that the cost of training all dimensions by BOA becomes expensive with the increase of problem dimensionality. Since data are relatively sparse in a high dimensional space, even though BOA can train all dimensions simultaneously, the interdependent relations between different dimensions are difficult to learn. Its search ability is thus significantly reduced. In this paper, we propose a team of Bayesian optimization algorithms (TBOA) to search and learn dimensionality. TBOA consists of multiple BOAs, in which each BOA corresponds to a dimension of the solution domain and it is responsible for the search of this dimension's value region. The proposed TBOA is used to solve the real problem of task assignment in heterogeneous computing systems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the computational cost of the overall training in TBOA is decreased very significantly while keeping high solution accuracy.",2014

When dealing with combinatorial optimization problems and univariate EDAs, models can be combined successfully by using a convex combination of the two probabilistic models [5]. In this paper we present an alternative way of combining probabilistic models. The new proposal for model combination is based on local search methods, and has its motivation in trying to identify what parts of the incoming model can help to improve the inner one, and to use only these parts to update the incoming model, instead of updating the whole one as in [5].

A clustering analysis approach is utilized in AMEDA to discover the distribution structure of the population. Based on the distribution information, with a certain probability, a local or a global multivariate Gaussian model (MGM) is built for each solution to sample a new solution. A covariance sharing strategy is designed in AMEDA to reduce the complexity of building MGMs, and an adaptive update strategy of the probability that controls the contributions of the two types of MGMs is developed to dynamically balance exploration and exploitation. AMEDA is compared with four representative MOEAs on a number of test instances with complex Pareto fronts and variable linkages.

To alleviate the problems of these two methods of encoding, real-coded Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs), which replace the recombination operators of GAs with estimation and sampling of the probability density function of the variables at each generation, have been proposed.

In each generation, the joint probability distribution of the selected solutions is estimated using a Gaussian Mixture model. Then, learning the graphical model of dependencies among random variables and sampling are done separately for each Gaussian component. In the learning step, using the selected solutions of each Gaussian mixture component, the structure of a Markov network is learned. This network is decomposed to maximal cliques and a clique graph. Then, complete Bayesian network structures are learned for these subgraphs using an optimization algorithm. The proposed optimization problem is a 0-1 constrained quadratic programming which finds the best permutation of variables. Then, sampling is done from each Bayesian network of each Gaussian component.

Behaviour of UMDAc with truncation selection on monotonous functions,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000232173100339,"Grahl, X, Minner, S and Rothlauf, F","Of late, much progress has been made in developing Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDA), algorithms that use probabilistic modelling of high quality solutions to guide their search. While experimental results on EDA behaviour are widely available, theoretical results are still rare. This is especially the case for continuous EDA. In this article, we develop theory that predicts the behaviour of the Univariate Marginal Distribution, Algorithm in the continuous domain (UMDA(c)) with truncation selection on monotonous fitness functions. Monotonous functions are commonly used to model the algorithm behaviour far from the optimum. Our result includes formulae to predict population statistics in a specific generation as well as population statistics after convergence. We find that population statistics develop identically for monotonous functions. We show that if assuming monotonous fitness functions, the distance that UMDA(c) travels across the search space is bounded and solely relies on the percentage of selected individuals and not on the structure of the fitness landscape. This can be problematic if this distance is too small for the algorithm to find the optimum. Also, by wrongly setting the selection intensity, one might not be able to explore the whole search space.",2005
A Multiobjective Estimation of Distribution Algorithm Based on Artificial Bee Colony,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000346422500064,"Novais, FT, Batista, LS, Guimaraes, FG","In this paper, we propose a hybrid Multiobjective Estimation of Distribution Algorithm based on Artificial Bee Colonies and Clusters (MOEDABC) to solve multiobjective optimization problems with continuous variables.

Each role is associated to specific tasks in the optimization process and employs different estimation of distribution methods. By combining estimation of distribution, clusterization of the objective domain, and the crowding distance assignment of NSGA-II, it was possible to extract more information about the optimization problem, thus enabling an efficient solution of large scale decision variable problems. Regarding the test problems, quality indicators, and GDE3, MOEA/D and NSGA-II methods, the combination of strategies incorporated into the MOEDABC algorithm has presented competitive results, which indicate this method as a useful optimization tool for the class of problems considered.",2013

Discovering structure is a feature of a range of algorithms, including estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) and perturbation methods (PMs). The complexity of structure has traditionally been used as a broad measure of problem difficulty, as the computational complexity relates directly to the complexity of structure. The EDA literature describes necessary and unnecessary interactions in terms of the relationship between problem structure and the structure of probabilistic graphical models discovered by the EDA. In this paper we introduce a classification of problems based on monotonicity invariance. We observe that the minimal problem structures for these classes often reveal that significant proportions of detected structures are unnecessary. We perform a complete classification of all functions on 3 bits. We consider nonmonotonicity linkage discovery using perturbation methods and derive a concept of directed ordinal linkage associated to optimization schedules. The resulting refined classification factored out by relabeling, shows a hierarchy of nine directed ordinal linkage classes for all 3-bit functions. We show that this classification allows precise analysis of computational complexity and parallelizability and conclude with a number of suggestions for future work.",2014

It has been proved to be NP complete, though. To solve this problem, researchers have provided many classic solutions. This paper proposes a new method of solving Steiner tree problem by using estimation of distribution algorithms (EDA). The basic idea is to initialize randomly n trees which contain the source node and the destination nodes. Some elites are selected by the selection operator. The algorithm then constructs a probabilistic model which attempts to estimate the probability distribution of the selected elites. Once the model is constructed, new trees are generated by sampling the distribution encoded by this model. These new trees are then incorporated back into the old population, possibly replacing it entirely. The process is repeated until some termination criteria are met. The algorithm constantly evolves trees to obtain a better solution tree with EDA ideas. This method leads to better performance, reduced time complexity, and optimized solution. Simulation results also show that the algorithm has better performance in searching and converging.",2013
Sporadic model building for efficiency enhancement of hierarchical BOA,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000249917300064,"Pelikan, M, Sastry, K and Goldberg, DE","This paper describes and analyzes sporadic model building, which can be used to enhance the efficiency of the hierarchical Bayesian optimization algorithm (hBOA) and other advanced estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) that use complex multivariate probabilistic models. With sporadic model building, the structure of the probabilistic model is updated once every few iterations (generations), whereas in the remaining iterations only model parameters (conditional and marginal probabilities) axe updated. Since the time complexity of updating model parameters is much lower than the time complexity of learning the model structure, sporadic model building decreases the overall time complexity of model building. The paper shows that for boundedly difficult nearly decomposable and hierarchical optimization problems, sporadic model building leads to a significant model-building speedup that decreases the asymptotic time complexity of model building in hBOA by a factor of Theta(n(0.26)) to Theta(n(0.5)), where n is the problem size. On the other hand, sporadic model building also increases the number of evaluations until convergence; nonetheless, the evaluation slowdown is insignificant compared to the gains in the asymptotic complexity of model building.",2006

In this work, two new approaches of a previous system, automatic design of artificial neural networks (ADANN) applied to forecast time series, are tackled. In ADANN, the automatic process to design artificial neural networks was carried out by a genetic algorithm (GA). This paper evaluates three methods to evolve neural networks architectures, one carried out with genetic algorithm, a second one carried out with differential evolution algorithm (DE) and the last one using estimation of distribution algorithms (EDA). A comparative study among these three methods with a set of referenced time series will be shown.

The greedy approach has the disadvantage of usually becoming trapped in local optima, while the branch and bound approach, basically A* search, usually comes down to approximate search because of memory requirements, losing in this way its guaranteed optimality.

It can help to select more optimum individuals for probabilistic model of EDAs algorithm. And a set of guided operators are used to increase the diversity of population and the likelihood of escaping from local optima. Secondly, an improved backtracking repairing algorithm is proposed to repair invalid individuals sampled by the probabilistic model of EDAs for the long sequence protein instances. A detection procedure of feasibility is added to avoid entering invalid closed areas when selecting directions for the residues.

But they have difficulties in solving multimodal functions with irregular landscapes, such as wide basins, flat plateaus and deep valleys. Gaussian mixture model based EDAs have been developed to remedy this disadvantage of single Gaussian based EDAs. A general framework NichingEDA is presented in this paper from a new perspective to boost single model based EDAs' performance. Through adopting a niching method and recombination operators in a population of EDAs, NichingEDA significantly boosts the traditional single model based EDAs' performance by making use of the diversity inside the EDA population on hard problems without estimating a precise distribution. Our experimental studies have shown that NichingEDA is very effective for some hard global optimization problems, although its scalability to high dimensional functions needs improving.

Simple crossover operators were replaced by recombination based on estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). The combination showed that XCS with such a statistics-based crossover operator can solve challenging hierarchical functions more efficiently. This study elaborates the gained competence further investigating the coding scheme for the EDA component (BOA in our case) of XCS as well as performance in randomly generated Boolean function problems. Results in hierarchical Boolean functions show that the originally used 2-bit coding scheme induces a certain learning bias that stresses additional diversity in the evolving XCS population. A I-bit coding scheme as well as a restricted 2-bit coding scheme confirm the suspected bias. The alternative encodings decrease the unnecessary bias towards specificity and increase performance robustness.

The question is how good representations can be found and how they can be adapted online to account for what can be learned about the structure of the problem from previous samples. We address these questions in a scenario that we term indirect Estimation-of-Distribution: We consider a decorrelated search distribution (mutational variability) on a variable length genotype space. A one-to-one encoding onto the phenotype space then needs to induce an adapted phenotypic search distribution incorporating the dependencies between phenotypic variables that have been observed successful previously. Formalizing this in the framework of Estimation-of-Distribution Algorithms, an adapted phenotypic search distribution can be characterized as minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) to a population of previously selected samples (parents). The paper derives a relation between this KLD and the description length of the encoding, stating that compact representations provide a way to minimize the divergence.

In other words, they do not learn the structure of Markov network, and assume that it is known in advance. This work presents a recent development in DEUM framework - a fully multivariate DEUM algorithm that can automatically learn the undirected structure of the problem, automatically find the cliques from the structure and automatically estimate a joint probability model of the Markov network. This model is then sampled using Monte Carlo samplers. The chapter also reviews some of the key works on use of Markov networks in EDAs, and explains the fitness modelling concept used by DEUM. The proposed DEUM algorithm can be applied to any general optimisation problems even when the structure is not known.",2010

Both spikes and input features in ipESNN are represented as quantum bits being in a superposition of two states (I and 0) defined by a probability density function. This representation allows for the state of an entire ipESNN at any time to be represented probabilistically in a quantum bit register and probabilistically optimised until convergence using quantum gate operators and a fitness function. The proposed ipESNN is a promising framework for both engineering applications and brain data modeling as it offers faster and more efficient feature selection and model optimization in a large dimensional space in addition to revealing new knowledge that is not possible to obtain using other models.

Anisotropic adaptive variance scaling for Gaussian estimation of distribution algorithm,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000428494600010,"Ren, ZG, Liang, YS, Li, BY","Traditional Gaussian estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) are confronted with issues that the variable variances decrease fast and the main search direction tends to become perpendicular to the improvement direction of the fitness function, which reduces the search efficiency of Gaussian EDAs (GEDAs) and makes them subject to premature convergence. In this paper, a novel anisotropic adaptive variance scaling (AAVS) technique is proposed to improve the performance of traditional GEDAs and a new GEDA variant named AAVS-EDA is developed. The advantages of AAVS over the existing variance scaling strategies lie in its ability for tuning the variances and main search direction of GEDA simultaneously, which are achieved by anisotropically scaling the variances along different eigendirections based on corresponding landscape characteristics captured by a simple topology -based detection method. Besides, AAVS-EDA also adopts an auxiliary global monitor to ensure its convergence by shrinking all the variances if no improvement is achieved in a generation. The evaluation results on 30 benchmark functions of CEC2014 test suite demonstrate that AAVS-EDA possesses stronger global optimization efficiency than traditional GEDAs. The comparison with other state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms also shows that AAVS-EDA is efficient and competitive. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2018

These problems are challenging and well known by the dynamic nature of their objective functions, constraint functions, and problem parameters which often change over time. In fact, dealing with these problems has not been investigated in detail using the Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs). Thus, we propose in this paper an EDA-based on Vine Copulas algorithm to deal with Dynamic Multiobjective Problems (DMOPs). Vines Copulas are graphical models that represent multivariate dependence using bivariate copulas. The proposed Copula-based Estimation of Distribution Algorithm, labeled Dynamic Vine-Copula Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (DynVC-EDA), is used to implement two search strategies. The first strategy is an algorithm that uses the model as a memory to save the status of the best solutions obtained during the current generation. The second strategy is a prediction-based algorithm that uses the history of the best solutions to predict a new population when a change occurs. The proposed algorithms are tested using a set of benchmarks provided with CEC2015 and the Gee-Tan-Abbass.

Meanwhile, it is considerably challenging to achieve explainable solution as well as significant performance due to computation complexity and variable diversity. To efficaciously handle the difficulty, this paper presents a novel metaheuristic-based time series clustering method which can improve the effectiveness and logicality of existing clustering approaches. The proposed method collects candidate cluster references from hierarchical and partitional clustering through shape-based distance measure as well as dynamic time warping (DTW) on manufacturing time series data. By applying metaheuristics highlighting estimation of distribution algorithms (EDA), such as extended compact genetic algorithm (ECGA), on the collected candidate clusters, advanced cluster centroid combinations with minimal distances can be achieved. ECGA employs the least complicated and the most closely related probabilistic model structure regarding population space during generation cycle. This feature strengthens the comprehension of clustering results in how such optimal solutions were achieved. The proposed method was tested on real-world time series data, open to the public, from manufacturing industry, and showed noticeable performances compared to well-established methods.

Generally, the performance of an EDA depends on the match between its driving probability distribution and the landscape of the problem being solved. Because most well-known EDAs, including CMA-ES, NES, and AMaLGaM, use a uni-modal search distribution, they have a high risk of getting trapped in local optima when a problem is multi-modal with a (moderate) number of relatively comparable modes. This risk could potentially be mitigated using niching methods that define multiple regions of interest where separate search distributions govern sub-populations. However, a key question is how to determine a suitable number of niches, especially in BBO. In this paper, we present a novel, adaptive niching approach that determines the niches through hierarchical clustering based on the correlation between the probability densities and fitness values of solutions. We test the performance of a combination of this niching approach with AMaLGaM on both new and well-known niching benchmark problems and find that the new approach properly identifies multiple landscape modes, leading to much better performance on multi-modal problems than with a non-niched, uni-modal EDA.y",2017

We compare two evolutionary algorithms (EAs) for optimizing expansion plans: the classic genetic algorithm (GA) with uniform crossover and the Gene-pool Optimal Mixing Evolutionary Algorithm (GOMEA) that learns and exploits linkage information between problem variables. We study the impact of incorporating different levels of problem-specific knowledge in the variation operators as well as two constraint-handling techniques: constraint domination and repair mechanisms. Experiments show that the use of problem-specific' variation operators is far more important for the classic GA to find high-quality solutions to the DNEP problem. GOMEA is found to have far more robust performance even when an out-of-box variant is used that doesn't exploit problem-specific knowledge. Based on experiments, we suggest that when selecting optimization algorithms for real-world applications like DNEP, EAs that have the ability to model and exploit problem structures, such as GOMEAs and estimation-of-distribution algorithms, should be given priority, especially when problem-specific knowledge is not straightforward to exploit, e.g. in the case of black-box optimization.",2015

With the aid of linkage information, efficient evolution can be attained by GAs. Among variants of advanced GAs, linkages are either explicitly identified, as in perturbation-based methods, or implicitly extracted, as in estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). As linkage discovery can be considered a matter of information extraction, Shannon's entropy, a renowned metric, has been widely adopted in modern GAs. Despite the validation of theoretical bounds, which is not algorithm-specific, on evaluation complexity of linkage problems, a representative population sizing model for discrete EDAs has been developed based on the distribution of entropy measurement. On the other hand, though entropy metrics have been adopted in recent perturbation-based methods, relevant complexity analysis on these methods is still absent. In this article, we propose a population sizing model for a recently developed linkage identification method, called inductive linkage identification (ILI). The proposed model takes the entropy-based classification algorithm into account and is capable of providing an accurate estimation of population requirement. The adopted modelling approach is different than that for discrete EDAs and may give researchers insights into entropy-based linkage discovery approaches.",2013

Thus, as the motivation to improve the quality of the results generated by AutoClustering, and to avoid possible bias by the adoption of a classifier, this work proposes to increase the efficiency of the evaluation process by the addition of a quality metric based on a fusion of three quality indexes of solution clusters.

We present the level-based theorem, a new technique tailored to population-based processes. It applies to any nonelitist process where offspring are sampled independently from a distribution depending only on the current population. Given conditions on this distribution, our technique provides upper bounds on the expected time until the process reaches a target state. The technique is demonstrated on pseudo-Boolean functions, the sorting problem, and approximation of optimal solutions in combinatorial optimization. The conditions of the theorem are often straightforward to verify, even for genetic algorithms and estimation of distribution algorithms which were considered highly nontrivial to analyze.

Some authors have suggested that employing a heavy tailed search distribution, such as a Cauchy, may make EDA better explore a high dimensional search space. However, other authors have found Cauchy search distributions are less effective than Gaussian search distributions in high dimensional problems. In this paper, we set out to resolve this controversy. To achieve this we run extensive experiments on a battery of high-dimensional test functions, and develop some theory which shows that small search steps are always more likely to move the search distribution towards the global optimum than large ones and, in particular, large search steps in high-dimensional spaces do badly in this respect with high probability. We hypothesise that, since exploration by large steps is mostly counterproductive in high dimensions, and since the fraction of good directions decays exponentially fast with increasing dimension, instead one should focus mainly on finding the right direction in which to move the search distribution. We propose a minor change to standard Gaussian EDA which implicitly achieves this aim, and our experiments on a sequence of test functions confirm the good performance of our new approach.",2016

Thus, they do not allow for a straightforward application of traditional optimization techniques. In these settings, randomized search heuristics such as evolutionary algorithms are a popular choice because they are often assumed to exhibit some kind of resistance to noise. Empirical evidence suggests that some algorithms, such as estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) are robust against a scaling of the noise intensity, even without resorting to explicit noise-handling techniques such as resampling. In this paper, we want to support such claims with mathematical rigor. We introduce the concept of graceful scaling in which the run time of an algorithm scales polynomially with noise intensity. We study a monotone fitness function over binary strings with additive noise taken from a Gaussian distribution. We show that myopic heuristics cannot efficiently optimize the function under arbitrarily intense noise without any explicit noise-handling. Furthermore, we prove that using a population does not help. Finally, we show that a simple EDA called the compact genetic algorithm can overcome the short-sightedness of mutation-only heuristics to scale gracefully with noise.

There are many approaches to discovering these dependencies, and existing work has already shown that often these approaches discover ""unnecessary"" elements of structure - that is, elements which are not needed to correctly rank solutions. This work performs an exhaustive analysis of all 2 and 3 bit problems, grouped into classes based on mononotic invariance. It is shown in [1] that each class has a minimal Walsh structure that can be used to solve the problem. We compare the structure discovered by different structure learning approaches to the minimal Walsh structure for each class, with summaries of which interactions are (in) correctly identified.

In this paper, we develop a new variant of EDA-MCC called EDA-MCC-MI which uses mutual information (MI) estimates to determine dependencies between the search variables, replacing linear correlation. Our method is in a better position to determine the correct dependency structure than the EDA-MCC can do, simply because MI is zero if and only if the variables are independent, whereas a zero correlation does not imply independence in general.

A one-to-one encoding onto the phenotype space then needs to induce an adapted phenotypic variability incorporating the dependencies between phenotypic variables that have been observed successful previously. Formalizing this in the framework of Estimation-of-Distribution Algorithms, an adapted phenotypic variability can be characterized as minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence to a population of previously selected individuals (parents). Our core result is a relation between the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the description length of the encoding in the specific scenario, stating that compact codes provide a way to minimize this divergence.

To overcome the shortcomings of EDAs, this paper proposed a latent space-based EDA (LS-EDA), which transforms the multivariate probabilistic model of Gaussian-based EDA into its principal component latent subspace with lower dimensionality. LS-EDA can efficiently reduce the complexity of EDA while maintaining its probability model without losing key information to scale up its performance for LSGOs. When the original dimensions are projected to the latent subspace, those dimensions with larger projected value make more contribution to the optimization process. LS-EDA can also help recognize and understand the problem structure, especially for black-box optimization problems.

When building the model, the positions of a series of pixels are taken as the decision variable, and the differences between the colors of pixels and those of a hand are taken as objective functions. A method of gesture segmentation based on a two-phase estimation of distribution algorithm is proposed according to the correlation among the positions of pixels. The method divides the solution of the problem based on evolutionary optimization into two phases, and uses different estimation of distribution algorithms in different phases. In the first phase, the probability model of candidates is formulated by a number of intervals given the fact that the positions of hand pixels distribute in several intervals. In the second phase, the probability model of candidates is built through a series of segments since the positions of hand pixels further distribute around curves. A series of pixels constituting a hand region are obtained based on sampling by the above probability models. The proposed method is applied to 2515 problems of gesture segmentation, and is compared with the existing methods. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Decentralized Multi-objective Robust Control of Interconnected Fuzzy Singular Perturbed Model with Multiple Perturbation Parameters,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000309188200303,"Yuan, Y, Sun, FC and Hu, YN","This paper investigates the decentralized multi-objective robust control for the interconnected fuzzy singular perturbed model with multiple perturbation parameters. Some practical systems, such as the large power system, usually exhibits the characters of multiple time scale and interconnections among subsystems. Thus, the interconnected fuzzy singular perturbed model is proposed to model such industrial system. Additionally, the fuzzy singular perturbed model with multiple perturbation parameters can describe a nonlinear multiple time scale system more precisely than the one with a single perturbation param- eter. However, the concentrated control of interconnected fuzzy singular perturbed model can not achieve excellent performance due to the interconnection term. Sometimes the interconnection term, which can be regarded as the external disturbance, may even lead to divergence in the control system. Thus, in this paper, the decentralized multi-objective robust controller is proposed. On one hand, the control of the fuzzy singular perturbed model can achieve good results under the condition of cross-linking among the subsystems by using the decentralized controller. On the other hand, a multi-extreme optimization model is established considering the noise resistance level, dynamical performance and the control input amplitude comprehensively. The method of Estimation of Distribution Algorithms is utilized to solve this optimization model.

Hybrid Approaches and Dimensionality Reduction for Portfolio Selection with Cardinality Constraints,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000276821200007,"Ruiz-Torrubiano, R and Su√°rez, A","A novel memetic algorithm that combines evolutionary algorithms, quadratic programming, and specially devised pruning heuristics is proposed for the selection of cardinality-constrained optimal portfolios. The framework used is the standard Markowitz mean-variance formulation for portfolio optimization with constraints of practical interest, such as minimum and maximum investments per asset and/or on groups of assets. Imposing limits on the number of different assets that can be included in the investment transforms portfolio selection into an NP-complete mixed-integer quadratic optimization problem that is difficult to solve by standard methods. An implementation of the algorithm that employs a genetic algorithm with a set representation, an appropriately defined mutation operator and Random Assortment Recombination for crossover (RAR-GA) is compared with implementations using Simulated Annealing (SA) and various Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs). An empirical investigation of the performance of the portfolios selected with these different methods using financial data shows that RAR-GA and SA are superior to the implementations with EDAs in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. The use of pruning heuristics that effectively reduce the dimensionality of the problem by identifying and eliminating from the universe of investment assets that are not expected to appear in the optimal portfolio leads to significant improvements in performance and makes EDAs competitive with RAR-GA and SA.",2010
Enabling the Extended Compact Genetic Algorithm for Real-Parameter Optimization by Using Adaptive Discretization,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000277101800002,"Chen, YP and Chen, CH","An adaptive discretization method, called split-on-demand (SoD), enables estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) for discrete variables to solve continuous optimization problems. SoD randomly splits a continuous interval if the number of search points within the interval exceeds a threshold, which is decreased at every iteration. After the split operation, the nonempty intervals are assigned integer codes, and the search points are discretized accordingly. As an example of using SoD with EDAs, the integration of SoD and the extended compact genetic algorithm (ECGA) is presented and numerically examined. In this integration, we adopt a local search mechanism as an optional component of our back end optimization engine. As a result, the proposed framework can be considered as a memetic algorithm, and SoD can potentially be applied to other memetic algorithms. The numerical experiments consist of two parts: (1) a set of benchmark functions on which ECGA with SoD and ECGA with two well-known discretization methods: the fixed-height histogram (FHH) and the fixed-width histogram (FWH) are compared; (2) a real-world application, the economic dispatch problem, on which ECGA with SoD is compared to other methods. The experimental results indicate that SoD is a better discretization method to work with ECGA. Moreover, ECGA with SoD works quite well on the economic dispatch problem and delivers solutions better than the best known results obtained by other methods in existence.",2010

In EDAs, a model is learned from the selected population that encodes interactions among problem variables. New individuals are generated by sampling the model and incorporated into the population. Different probabilistic models have been used in EDAs to learn interactions. Bayesian network (BN) is a well-known graphical model which is used in BOA. Learning a proper model in EDAs and particularly in BOA is distinguished as a computationally expensive task. Different methods have been proposed in the literature to improve the complexity of model building in EDAs. This paper employs bivariate dependencies to learn accurate BNs in BOA efficiently. The proposed approach extracts the bivariate dependencies using an appropriate pairwise interaction-detection metric. Due to the static structure of the underlying problems, these dependencies are used in each generation of BOA to learn an accurate network. By using this approach, the computational cost of model building is reduced dramatically. Various optimization problems are selected to be solved by the algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed approach successfully finds the optimum in problems with different, types of interactions efficiently.

Minimization of the Total Traveling Distance and Maximum Distance by Using a Transformed-Based Encoding EDA to Solve the Multiple Traveling Salesmen Problem,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000362023800001,"Chen, SH","Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) have been used to solve numerous hard problems. However, their use with in-group optimization problems has not been discussed extensively in the literature. A well-known in-group optimization problem is the multiple traveling salesmen problem (mTSP), which involves simultaneous assignment and sequencing procedures and are shown in different forms. This paper presents a new algorithm, named EDA(MLA), which is based on self-guided genetic algorithm with a minimum loading assignment (MLA) rule. This strategy uses the transformed-based encoding approach instead of direct encoding. The solution space of the proposed method is only n!. We compare the proposed algorithm against the optimal direct encoding technique, the two-part encoding genetic algorithm, and, in experiments on 34 TSP instances drawn from the TSPLIB, find that its solution space is n! ((n-1)(m-1)). The scale of the experiments exceeded that presented in prior studies. The results show that the proposed algorithm was superior to the two-part encoding genetic algorithmin terms of minimizing the total traveling distance. Notably, the proposed algorithm did not cause a longer traveling distance when the number of salesmen was increased from 3 to 10. The results suggest that EDA researchers should employ the MLA rule instead of direct encoding in their proposed algorithms.",2015

In particular, in this case the log of the distance to the optimum is linear on the log of the number of resamplings. As well as with number of resamplings polynomial in the inverse step-size. We show empirically that this convergence rate is obtained also with polynomial number of resamplings. In this polynomial resampling setting, using classical evolution strategies and an ad hoc choice of the number of resamplings, we seemingly get the same rate as those obtained with specific Estimation of Distribution Algorithms designed for noisy setting.|We also experiment non-adaptive polynomial resamplings.

One of the most used methods for segmentation is thresholding which can be formulated as an optimization problem, and evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are alternatives commonly applied to solve it. Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) is a branch of EAs that explores the search space by building a probabilistic model, such as Bayesian Networks (BNs). In this article is proposed a BN-based EDA for multilevel image segmentation called BNMTH. The proposed approach iteratively selects the combination of thresholding techniques that permits to find the best configuration of thresholds for a digital image, exploring the inter-dependencies between the decision variables (thresholds) and the different techniques. BNMTH is applied over a set of benchmark images and the results of the segmentation are qualitatively analyzed by using the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), the Structure Similarity Index (SSIM) and the Feature Similarity Index (FSIM). Besides, a statistical analysis is provided to compare BNMTH with other state-of-the-art optimization algorithms. The results show that BNMTH is a competitive approach for image segmentation, providing accurate results in almost all the cases.

Before departure, the optimal speed profile for an entire route is generated by an EDA in combination with speedup approaches for a faster computing time, which can optimize the complex cost function of ecodriving without simplification within a reasonably short computing time. This optimization is performed in a distance domain for localizing changes in the optimal speed profile due to traffic conditions while driving. After departure, by taking the optimal speed profile and actual traffic conditions into consideration, the speed profile for a short term-to only the next location-is adapted. In order to reliably react to actual traffic conditions, additional points are interpolated into the long-term distance step and fine control of speeds at the additional points is established, which is based on a predictive model for estimating the spacing to the preceding vehicle. The proposed ecodriving system is evaluated in two types of route conditions, and its results are compared with the optimization result by the quadratic programming method.

As all EDAs, compact algorithms build and update a probabilistic model of the distribution of solutions within the search space, as opposed to population-based algorithms that instead make use of an explicit population of solutions. In addition to that, to keep their memory consumption low, compact algorithms purposely employ simple probabilistic models that can be described with a small number of parameters. Despite their simplicity, compact algorithms have shown good performances on a broad range of benchmark functions and real-world problems. However, compact algorithms also come with some drawbacks, i.e. they tend to premature convergence and show poorer performance on non-separable problems. To overcome these limitations, here we investigate a possible algorithmic scheme obtained by combining compact algorithms with a non-disruptive restart mechanism taken from the literature, named Re-Sampled Inheritance (RI). The resulting compact algorithms with RI are tested on the CEC 2014 benchmark functions. The numerical results show on the one hand that the use of RI consistently enhances the performances of compact algorithms, still keeping a limited usage of memory.

They use machine-learning techniques to discover problem's substructures that might be useful to generate new solutions. This idea was grounded on Simon's near-decomposability principle and Holland's Building Block (BB)-hypothesis, and have enabled the development of effective algorithms in some contexts. Although near-decomposability is commonly seen in nature, we cannot assume the same occurs for optimization problems. Therefore, the existence of problems where these algorithms are not effective is also focus of research. Recent studies have argued that Multidimensional Knapsack Problems (MKPs) are examples of such cases. This paper extends these studies with an extensive comparison of various LTGA variants for the MKP. Using a well-known GA as reference, we analyzed the difficulties faced by the LTGA and explained why its linkage-tree model is not of much help to solve the problem. The results have shown that the LTGA was not able to outperform the GA and performed very similarly to a LTGA using random linkage-models. Further analysis of the linkage-trees, grounded on the knapsack-core concept, enabled interesting conclusions about the reason that linkage-learning did not provide useful information to solve MKPs in the settings used for the experiments.

Different algorithms fit this framework, and they differ according to the policy they implement to identify the next distribution in the model. In this paper we present two algorithms, in the stochastic relaxation framework, for the optimization of real-valued functions defined over binary variables: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Stochastic Natural Gradient Descent (SNDG). These algorithms use a stochastic model to sample from as it happens for Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs), but the estimation of the model from the population is substituted by the direct update of model parameter through stochastic gradient descent. The two algorithms, SGD and SNDG, both use statistical models in the exponential family, but they differ in the use of the natural gradient, first proposed in the literature by Amari [5], in the context of Information Geometry. Due to the properties of the exponential family, both gradient and natural gradient can be evaluated in terms of covariances between the fitness function and the sufficient statistics of the exponential family. As the computation of the exact gradient is unfeasible, we approximate the gradient by evaluating empirical covariances. We test the performance of our algorithm over different standard benchmarks, and we compare the results with other well-known meta-heuristics in the framework of EDAs.",2011
Artificial chromosomes with genetic algorithm 2 (ACGA2) for single machine scheduling problems with sequence-dependent setup times,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000331545600015,"Chen, SH, Chen, MC and Liou, YC","Artificial chromosomes with genetic algorithm (ACGA) is one of the latest versions of the estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). This algorithm has already been applied successfully to solve different kinds of scheduling problems. However, due to the fact that its probabilistic model does not consider variable interactions, ACGA may not perform well in some scheduling problems, particularly if sequence dependent setup times are considered. This is due to the fact that the previous job will influence the processing time of the next job. Simply capturing ordinal information from the parental distribution is not sufficient for a probabilistic model. As a result, this paper proposes a bi-variate probabilistic model to add into the ACGA. This new algorithm is called the ACGA2 and is used to solve single machine scheduling problems with sequence-dependent setup times in a common due-date environment. A theoretical analysis is given in this paper. Some heuristics and local search algorithm variable neighborhood search (VNS) are also employed in the ACGA2. The results indicate that the average error ratio of this ACGA2 is half the error ratio of the ACGA. In addition, when ACGA2 is applied in combination with other heuristic methods and VNS, the hybrid algorithm achieves optimal solution quality in comparison with other algorithms in the literature. Thus, the proposed algorithms are effective for solving the scheduling problems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.",2014

This paper proposes a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of an EDA with the powerful optimization capabilities of Simulated Annealing (SA) in synergy with a mutation operator and the initialization using the Latin Hypercube. It is called directed EDA (R-EDA). The hybrid algorithm permits abetter exploration since the early optimization stages.

In such problems, adaptive, self-organizing agent approaches have been shown to provide very robust solutions. However, these approaches often require non-trivial amounts of time to respond to large environmental shifts. Considering this limitation, we observe that environmental changes in a given dynamic problem are generally not completely random; similar states in the environment tend to reappear over time. Memory is one way to leverage this past information and improve the adaptive efficiency of the agent system. In this paper, we explore the use of memory as a means of boosting the performance of self-organizing agents in solving dynamic coordination problems. We consider the specific problem of coordinating product flows in a factory that is subject to changing job mixes over time, which has been previously solved using a computational model of the task allocation behavior of wasps. We augment this base procedure with a number of memory systems, the most sophisticated of which exploit memory models inspired by estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) to manage computational cost.

EDAs have been successfully applied to many real-world problems; however, whether their models indicate the optimal way to decompose the given problem is rarely studied. This paper proposes using the number of function evaluations (N-fe) as the performance measure of EDA models. As a result, the optimal model can be defined as the one that consumes the fewest N-fe on average for EDAs to solve a specific problem. Based on this concept, correct building blocks (BBs) can be defined as groups of genes that construct the optimal model. Similarly, linkages within a BB are defined as the correct linkages of which the specific problem consists. The capabilities of four commonly used linkage-learning metrics, nonlinearity, entropy, simultaneity and differential mutual complement, are investigated based on the above definitions. For certain partially separable problems, none of the above metrics yields difference that is statistically significant between linear and nonlinear gene pairs. Although an optimal threshold still exists to separate linear and nonlinear gene pairs, most existing EDA designs today have not yet characterize such threshold. Based on the idea of N-fe estimation, this paper also proposes a metric enhancer, named eNFE, to enhance existing linkage-learning techniques. Empirical results show that eNFE improves BB identification by eliminating spurious linkages which occur often in most existing EDAs. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",2013

The principal reason is largely due to the deficiency of the existing genetic operators which cannot generate promising offspring from parents chosen by the Pareto-dominance rule in these MOEAs. Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) generate offspring with a probabilistic model built from the statistics extracting upon existing solutions to expectedly alleviate the weakness arisen in genetic operators.

In this paper we explain the relationship of EDA to algorithms developed in statistics, artificial intelligence, and statistical physics. The major design issues are discussed within a general interdisciplinary framework. It is shown that maximum entropy approximations play a crucial role. All proposed algorithms try to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence KLD between the unknown distribution p(x) and a class q(x) of approximations. However, the Kullback-Leibler divergence is not symmetric. Approximations which suppose that the function to be optimized is additively decomposed (ADF) minimize KLD(q vertical bar vertical bar p), the methods which learn the approximate model from data minimize KLD(p vertical bar vertical bar q). This minimization is identical to maximizing the log-likelihood. In the paper three classes of algorithms are discussed. FDA uses the ADF to compute an approximate factorization of the unknown distribution. The factors are marginal distributions, whose values are computed from samples. The second class is represented by the Bethe-Kikuchi approach which has recently been rediscovered in statistical physics. Here the values of the marginals are computed from a difficult constrained minimization problem. The third class learns the factorization from the data. We analyze our learning algorithm LFDA in detail. It is shown that learning is faced with two problems: first, to detect the important dependencies between the variables, and second, to create an acyclic Bayesian network of bounded clique size.",2005

The vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW) requires the delivery made in a specific time window for every customer and returning to the depot before a due time. Contrary to current research, an estimation of distribution-algorithm-based approach coupled with a simulation model is proposed and developed to solve the problem and implement the solution. The approach mentioned makes use of a Bayesian network as a probability model to describe the distribution of the solution space. Furthermore, the approach taken in this study combines the key advantages of both estimation of distribution algorithms (EDA) and simulation.

A better position for each vertex on the sequence can be estimated through a Bayesian network.

The question of neural network design thus increases in importance, as traditional empirical approaches are reaching their limits. Manual design of network architectures from scratch relies heavily on trial and error, while using existing pretrained models can introduce redundancies or vulnerabilities. Automated neural architecture design is able to overcome these problems, but the most successful algorithms operate on significantly constrained design spaces, assuming the target network to consist of identical repeating blocks. While such approach allows for faster search, it does so at the cost of expressivity. We instead propose an alternative probabilistic representation of a whole neural network structure under the assumption of independence between layer types. Our matrix of probabilities is equivalent to the population of models, but allows for discovery of structural irregularities, while being simple to interpret and analyze. We construct an architecture search algorithm, inspired by the estimation of distribution algorithms, to take advantage of this representation. The probability matrix is tuned towards generating high-performance models by repeatedly sampling the architectures and evaluating the corresponding networks, while gradually increasing the model depth. Our algorithm is shown to discover non-regular models which cannot be expressed via blocks, but are competitive both in accuracy and computational cost, while not utilizing complex dataflows or advanced training techniques, as well as remaining conceptually simple and highly extensible.",2021
Efficient model building in competent genetic algorithms using DSM clustering,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000296883600001,"Nikanjam, A, Sharifi, H and Rahmani, AT","Detecting multivariate interactions between the variables of a problem is a challenge in traditional genetic algorithms (GAs). This issue has been addressed in the literature as the linkage learning problem. It is widely acknowledged that the success of GA in solving any problem depends on the proper detection of multivariate interactions in the problem. Different approaches have thus been proposed to detect and represent such interactions. Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) are amongst these approaches that have been successfully applied to a wide range of hard optimization problems. They build a model of the problem to detect multivariate interactions, but the model building process is often computationally intensive. In this paper, we propose a new clustering algorithm that turns pair-wise interactions in a dependency structure matrix (DSM) into an interaction model efficiently. The model building process is carried out before the evolutionary algorithm to save computational burden. The accurate interaction model obtained in this way is then used to perform an effective recombination of building blocks (BBs) in the GA. We applied the proposed approach to solve exemplar hard optimization problems with different types of linkages to show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach. Theoretical analysis and experiments showed that the building of an accurate model requires O(n log(n)) number of fitness evaluations. The comparison of the proposed approach with some existing algorithms revealed that the efficiency of the model building process is enhanced significantly.",2011
Linkage identification for real-valued loci by fitness difference classification,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000232173100176,"Tsuji, M, Munetomo, M and Akama, K","In order to enhance efficiency of genetic algorithms, it is important to identify a linkage set, i.e. a set of loci tightly linked to construct a building block. In this paper, we propose a novel linkage identification method for real-valued strings called the real-valued Dependency Detection for Distribution Derived from df (rD(5)). It can detect linkage sets with quasi-linear fitness evaluations. The rD(5) is designed based on the D-5 which has been proposed for binary strings. It detects dependencies of loci by estimating the distribution of strings classified according to fitness differences. The rD(5) and the LINC-R which is one of linkage identification methods proposed elsewhere, provide approximate equivalent information about a function to be solved, however, the rD(5) performs smaller number of fitness evaluations than the LINC-R for larger functions. Although estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) also estimate distribution of strings, it is difficult for EDAs to solve a function composed of exponentially scaled sub-functions. The proposed method, by contrast, can be applied to the function in the similar way to as to a function composed of uniformly scaled sub-functions which is easy for EDAs. We perform experiments to compare the proposed method with the LINC-R and to examine the scaling effect stability of the rD(5). We also investigate two parameters, that define the amount of perturbation (mutation) and that define the quantization level.",2005
Multi-objective optimization based on an improved cross-entropy method. A case study of a micro-scale manufacturing process,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000370088500009,"Beruvides, G, Quiza, R and Haber, RE","The strong points of Estimation-of-Distribution algorithms (EDAs) and specifically cross entropy methods are widely acknowledged. One of the main advantages of EDAs is that the fusion of prior information into the optimization procedure is straightforward, thereby reducing convergence time when such information is available. This study presents the modified Multi-Objective Cross-Entropy (MOCE+) method, based on a new procedure for addressing constraints: (i) the use of variable cutoff values for selecting the elitist population; and, (ii) filtering of the elitist population after each epoch. We study the proposed method in different test suites and compare its performance with some other well-known optimization methods. The comparative study demonstrates the good figures of merit of the MOCE+ method in complex test suites. Finally, the proposed method is applied to the multi-objective optimization of a micro-drilling process. Two conflicting targets are considered: total drilling time and vibrations on the plane that is perpendicular to the drilling axis. The Pareto front, obtained through the optimization process, is analyzed through quality metrics and the available options in the decision-making process. Overall, the quality metrics of the MOCE+ method were better than the metrics of the other optimization methods considered in this work. The reported optimization of the micro-drilling process with the proposed method could potentially have a direct impact on improvements in industrial efficiency. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The Benefit of Recombination in Noisy Evolutionary Search,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000383741800081,"Friedrich, T, K√∂tzing, T, Sutton, AM","Practical optimization problems frequently include uncertainty about the quality measure, for example due to noisy evaluations. Thus, they do not allow for a straightforward application of traditional optimization techniques. In these settings, randomized search heuristics such as evolutionary algorithms are a popular choice because they are often assumed to exhibit some kind of resistance to noise. Empirical evidence suggests that some algorithms, such as estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) are robust against a scaling of the noise intensity, even without resorting to explicit noise-handling techniques such as resampling.|In this paper, we want to support such claims with mathematical rigor. We introduce the concept of graceful scaling in which the run time of an algorithm scales polynomially with noise intensity. We study a monotone fitness function over binary strings with additive noise taken from a Gaussian distribution. We show that myopic heuristics cannot efficiently optimize the function under arbitrarily intense noise without any explicit noise-handling. Furthermore, we prove that using a population does not help. Finally we show that a simple EDA called the Compact Genetic Algorithm can overcome the shortsightedness of mutation-only heuristics to scale gracefully with noise. We conjecture that recombinative genetic algorithms also have this property.|This extended abstract summarizes our work ""The Benefit of Recombination in Noisy Evolutionary Search,"" which appeared in Proceedings of International Symposium on Algorithms and Computation (ISAAC), 2015, pp.140-150.",2016
Analyzing the k Most Probable Solutions in EDAs Based on Bayesian Networks,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000277912300008,"Echegoyen, C, Mendiburu, A, Lozano, JA","Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) have been successfully applied to a wide variety of problems but, for the most complex approaches, there is no clear understanding of the way these algorithms complete the search. For that reason, in this work we exploit the probabilistic models that EDAs based on Bayesian networks are able to learn in order to provide new information about their behavior. Particularly, we analyze the k solutions with the highest probability in the distributions estimated during the search. In order to study the relationship between the probabilistic model and the fitness function, we focus on calculating, for the k most probable solutions (MPSs), the probability values, the function values and the correlation between both sets of values at each step of the algorithm. Furthermore, the objective functions of the k MPSs are contrasted with the k best individuals in the population. We complete the analysis by calculating the position of the optimum in the k MPSs during the search and the genotypic diversity of these solutions. We carry out the analysis by optimizing functions of different natures such as Trap5, two variants of Ising spin glass and Max-SAT. The results not only show information about the relationship between the probabilistic model and the fitness function, but also allow us to observe characteristics of the search space, the quality of the setup of the parameters and even distinguish between successful and unsuccessful runs.",2010
A Classification-Based Model for Multi-Objective Hyperspectral Sparse Unmixing,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000505701800009,"Xu, X, Shi, ZW, Li, XL","Sparse unmixing has become a popular tool for hyperspectral imagery interpretation. It refers to finding the optimal subset of a spectral library to reconstruct the image data and further estimate the proportions of different materials. Recently, multi-objective based sparse unmixing methods have presented promising performance because of their advantages in addressing combinatorial problems. A spectral and multi-objective based sparse unmixing (SMoSU) algorithm was proposed in our previous work, which solves the decision-making problem well. However, it does not show outstanding advantages in strong noise cases. To solve the problem, in this paper, SMoSU is improved based on the estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). The machine learning based EDAs have been a reliable approach in solving multi-objective problems. However, most of them are for special problems and relatively weak in theoretical foundations. Thus, it is unreliable to extend it directly to sparse unmixing. Here, we improve EDA on the basis of classification and propose a classification-based model for individual generating under the framework of SMoSU (CM-MoSU). In CM-MoSU, the whole population is divided to be positive and negative. Then, the macroinformation of positive individuals is used to guide the generation of new individuals. Therefore, the optimization task could pay more attention to the feasible space with high quality. Moreover, some theoretical analyses are presented to prove the reliability of CM-MoSU. In experiments, several state-of-the-art sparse unmixing algorithms are compared. Both synthetic and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CM-MoSU.",2019
R-EVO: A Reactive Evolutionary Algorithm for the Maximum Clique Problem,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000297586200002,"Brunato, M and Battiti, R","An evolutionary algorithm with guided mutation (EA/G) has been proposed recently for solving the maximum clique problem. In the framework of estimation-of-distribution algorithms, guided mutation uses a model distribution to generate offspring by combining the local information of solutions found so far with global statistical information. Each individual is then subjected to a Marchiori's repair heuristic, based on randomized extraction and greedy expansion, to ensure that it represents a legal clique. A novel reactive and evolutionary algorithm (R-EVO) proposed in this paper starts from the same evolutionary framework but considers more complex individuals, which modify tentative solutions by local search with memory, according to the reactive search optimization (RSO) principles. In particular, the estimated distribution is used to periodically initialize the state of each individual based on the previous statistical knowledge extracted from the population. We demonstrate that the combination of the estimation-of-distribution concept with RSO produces significantly better results than EA/G for many test instances and it is remarkably robust with respect to the setting of the algorithm parameters. R-EVO adopts a drastically simplified low-knowledge version of reactive local search (RLS), with a simple internal diversification mechanism based on tabu-search, with a prohibition parameter proportional to the estimated best clique size. R-EVO is competitive with the more complex full-knowledge RLS-EVO that adopts the original RLS algorithm. For most of the benchmark instances, the hybrid scheme version produces significantly better results than EA/G for comparable or a smaller central processing unit time.",2011

On the one hand, it is presented in Sect. 10.1 a new family of cellular GAs in which a hierarchy is established inside the population such that better individuals are moved to the same region of the grid. This way, a faster convergence of the best individuals is promoted, while the diversity is maintained in locations far away from this region. This new hierarchical cellular model is applied here to GAs, but it can be implemented in any other family of EA. It can be helpful in parallel implementations looking for fail tolerance, since some parts of the population could be lost with negligible effects on the search. Also, faster convergence can be an interesting outcome of this new mode.|On the other hand, a new class of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) is addressed in Sect. 10.2. This new family of algorithms is known as cellular EDAs (cEDAs), and they are characterized by their decentralized population, which is partitioned into many small collaborating sub-populations, arranged in a toroidal grid, and interacting only with its neighboring sub-populations.|These two new families of cellular models are analyzed and compared in this chapter against their equivalent panmictic algorithms from the points of view of both theory and practice.",2008
Re-sampled inheritance compact optimization,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000582515800001,"Iacca, G and Caraffini, F","Compact optimization is an alternative paradigm in the field of metaheuristics requiring a modest use of memory to optimize a problem. As opposed to population-based algorithms, which conduct the search by employing a set of candidate solutions, compact algorithms use a probabilistic model to describe how solutions are distributed over the search space. Compared to other Estimation of Distribution Algorithms, peculiar features such as the use of simple probabilistic models, in which variables are treated independently, and the need for a minimal number of solutions to be sampled to perform the search, make these algorithms suitable for those applications plagued by memory limitations. Compact algorithms show good results on different kinds of optimization problems but often prematurely converge and perform poorly on non-separable. In this paper, we attempt to overcome these limitations by combining compact algorithms with a restart mechanism named Re-Sampled Inheritance (RI) whose purpose is to avoid premature convergence while also inheriting parts of the variables from the best solution found so far. To assess the effect of the RI mechanism, we extensively test various existing compact algorithms, with and without RI, and compare the best RI-based compact algorithm against several competing algorithms on several optimization problems at different dimensionalities. We also evaluate the effect of the RI parameters on the overall algorithmic performance. Our numerical results not only show that RI consistently enhances the performances of compact algorithms, but also shed some light on the effectiveness of different compact logics at handling problems at different dimensionalities.

One of the known rationales is the loss of selection pressure which leads to the selected parents not generating promising offspring toward Pareto-optimal front (PF) with diversity. Estimation of distribution algorithms sample new solutions with a probabilistic model built from the statistics extracting over the existing solutions so as to mitigate the adverse impact of genetic operators. In this paper, an improved regularity-based estimation of distribution algorithm is proposed to effectively tackle unconstrained MaOPs. In the proposed algorithm, diversity repairing mechanism is utilized to mend the areas, where need nondominated solutions with a closer proximity to the PF. Then favorable solutions are generated by the model built from the regularity of the solutions surrounding a group of representatives. These two steps collectively enhance the selection pressure which gives rise to the superior convergence of the proposed algorithm. In addition, dimension reduction technique is employed in the decision space to speed up the estimation search of the proposed algorithm. Finally, by assigning the Pareto-optimal solutions to the uniformly distributed reference vectors, a set of solutions with excellent diversity and convergence is obtained. To measure the performance, NSGA-III, GrEA, MOEA/D, HypE, MBN-EDA, and RM-MEDA are selected to perform comparison experiments over DTLZ and DTLZ(-) test suites with 3-, 5-, 8-, 10-, and 15-objective.

Many of the real-world problems can be decomposed into a number of sub-problems which may be solved easier. Appropriate decomposition is a significant issue specially for optimization problems where the optimal solution is usually obtained by combining the solutions of sub-problems. Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) are a type of evolutionary algorithms that learn a model of problem from the population of candidate solutions.|This model is intended to capture the interactions between problem variables, thus facilitating problem decomposition and is used to generate new solutions. In this paper, a novel type of problems is presented that is designed to challenge the model building process in discrete EDAs. The main idea is to propose a set of problems that their candidate solutions can be simultaneously decomposed into different sub-problems. This means that the candidate solution of a problem may be interpreted by two or more different structure where only one is true, resulting in the optimal solution to that problem. Some of these decompositions or structures may be more likely according to the low-order statistics collected from the population of candidate solutions, but may not necessarily lead to the optimal solution. Learning the correct structure/decomposition is a challenge for the model building process in EDA. The experimental results show that the proposed problems are indeed difficult for EDAs even when expressive models such as Bayesian networks are used to capture the interactions in the problem.",2016

An experimental space is defined over algorithms and problems, via a tuple of parameters for any specified algorithm and problem class (here determined by the landscape generator). An experiment is then clearly specified as a point in this space, in a way that is analogous to other areas of experimental algorithmics, and more generally in experimental design. Experimental results are presented, demonstrating the use of the landscape generator.

The success of the algorithm over a given optimization task relies on the suitability of its search heuristics for the problem-domain. Thus, the design of custom metaheuristic algorithms leads to more accurate solutions. Hyper-heuristics (HH) are important tools commonly used to select low-level heuristics (LLHs) to solve a specific problem. HH are able to acquire knowledge from the problems where they are used. However, as other artificial intelligence tools it is necessary to identify how the knowledge affects the performance of the algorithm. One way to generate such knowledge is to capture interactions between variables using probabilistic graphical models such as Bayesian networks (BN) in conjunction with estimation of distribution algorithms (EDA). This article presents a method based on that used an EDA based on BN as a high-level selection mechanism for HH called Hyper-heuristic approach based on Bayesian learning and evolutionary operators (HHBNO). Here the knowledge is extracted form BN to evolve the sequences of LLHs in an online learning process by exploring the inter-dependencies among the LLHs. The proposes approach is tested over CEC'17 set of benchmark function of single-objective real-parameter optimization. Statical tests verifies that the HHBNO presents competitive results in comparison with other metaheuristic algorithms with high performance in terms of convergence.

Biasing Bayesian Optimization Algorithm using Case Based Reasoning,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000295244800013,"Kaedi, M and Ghasem-Aghaee, N","Studies show that application of the prior knowledge in biasing the Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs), such as Bayesian Optimization Algorithm (BOA), increases the efficiency of these algorithms significantly. One of the main advantages of the EDAs over other optimization algorithms is that the former provides a trail of probabilistic models of candidate solutions with increasing quality. Some recent studies have applied these probabilistic models, obtained from previously solved problems in biasing the BOA algorithm, to solve the future problems. In this paper, in order to improve the previous works and reduce their disadvantages, a method based on Case Based Reasoning (CBR) is proposed for biasing the BOA algorithm. Herein, after running BOA for solving optimization problems, each problem, the corresponding solution, as well as the last Bayesian network obtained from the BOA algorithm, will be stored as an entry in the case-base. Upon introducing a new problem, similar problems from the case-base are retrieved and the last Bayesian networks of these solved problems are combined according to the degree of their similarity with the new problem; hence, a compound Bayesian network is constructed. The compound Bayesian network is sampled and the initial population for the BOA algorithm is generated. This network will be applied efficiently for biasing future probabilistic models during the runs of BOA for the new problem. The proposed method is tested on three well-known combinatorial benchmark problems.

It can detect the correlation between multiple variables and extract knowledge on regular patterns in solutions. Bayesian Networks (BNs) are used in BOA to represent the probability distributions of the best individuals. The BN's construction is challenging since there is a trade-off between acuity and computational cost to generate it. This trade-off is determined by combining a search algorithm (SA) and a scoring metric (SM). The SA is responsible for generating a promising BN and the SM assesses the quality of such networks. Some studies have already analyzed how this relationship affects the learning process of a BN. However, such investigation had not yet been performed to determine the bond linking the selection of SA and SM and the BOA's output quality. Acting on this research gap, a detailed comparative analysis involving two constructive heuristics and four scoring metrics is presented in this work. The classic version of BOA was applied to discrete and continuous optimization problems using binary and floating-point representations. The scenarios were compared through graphical analyses, statistical metrics, and difference detection tests. The results showed that the selection of SA and SM affects the quality of the BOA results since scoring metrics that penalize complex BN models perform better than metrics that do not consider the complexity of the networks.

A state-of-the-art optimizer for single-objective continuous functions that also uses probabilistic modeling is the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES). Different variants of CMA-ES have been proposed for MOPs however most of them are based on Pareto dominance as the main selection criterion. Recently, a new multi-objective CMA-ES called MOEA/D-CMA was proposed combining the strengths of CMA-ES with those of the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D). Nowadays, however, researchers on MOEAs agree that combining Pareto and decomposition can be beneficial for the search on MOPs. As a result, a new MOEA has been proposed, called MOEA/DD. This algorithm modifies the MOEA/D by including a new Pareto dominance update mechanism that brings more diversity into the search. In this study, we extend the MOEA/D-CMA by replacing its update mechanism by the one of MOEA/DD. The hypothesis is that this update mechanism will improve the performance of MOEA/D-CMA as it improved MOEA/D. MOEA/D-CMA and MOEA/DD-CMA are implemented and evaluated through an experimental study.

Symbolic modeling of epistasis,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000244256500007,"Moore, JH, Barney, N, White, BC","The workhorse of modern genetic analysis is the parametric linear model. The advantages of the linear modeling framework are many and include a mathematical understanding of the model fitting process and ease of interpretation. However, an important limitation is that linear models make assumptions about the nature of the data being modeled. This assumption may not be realistic for complex biological systems such as disease susceptibility where nonlinearities in the genotype to phenotype mapping relationship that result from epistasis, plastic reaction norms, locus heterogeneity, and phenocopy, for example, are the norm rather than the exception. We have previously developed a flexible modeling approach called symbolic discriminant analysis (SDA) that makes no assumptions about the patterns in the data. Rather, SDA lets the data dictate the size, shape, and complexity of a symbolic discriminant function that could include any set of mathematical functions from a list of candidates supplied by the user. Here, we outline a new five step process for symbolic model discovery that uses genetic programming (GP) for coarse-grained stochastic searching, experimental design for parameter optimization, graphical modeling for generating expert knowledge, and estimation of distribution algorithms for fine-grained stochastic searching. Finally, we introduce function mapping as a new method for interpreting symbolic discriminant functions. We show that function mapping when combined with measures of interaction information facilitates statistical interpretation by providing a graphical approach to decomposing complex models to highlight synergistic, redundant, and independent effects of polymorphisms and their composite functions.

The Gaussian distribution is commonly used as a search operator in most of the EDA methods. However there are indications in the literature that heavy tailed distributions may perform better due to their higher exploration capabilities. Univariate heavy tailed distributions were already proposed for high dimensional problems. In 2D problems it has been reported that a multivariate heavy tailed (such as Cauchy) search distribution is able to blend together the strengths of multivariate modelling with a high exploration power. In this paper, we study whether a similar scheme would work well in high dimensional search problems. To get around of the difficulty of multivariate model building in high dimensions we employ a recently proposed random projections (RP) ensemble based approach which we modify to get samples from a multivariate Cauchy using the scale-mixture representation of the Cauchy distribution. Our experiments show that the resulting RP-based multivariate Cauchy EDA consistently improves on the performance of the univariate Cauchy search distribution. However, intriguingly, the RP-based multivariate Gaussian EDA has the best performance among these methods. It appears that the highly explorative nature of the multivariate Cauchy sampling is exacerbated in high dimensional search spaces and the population based search loses its focus and effectiveness as a result. Finally, we present an idea to increase exploration while maintaining exploitation and focus by using the RP-based multivariate Gaussian EDA in which the RP matrices are drawn with i.i.d. heavy tailed entries.

These subgroups provide clues about the main biological processes. Until now, different approaches to this problem have been proposed. Most of them use the mean squared residue as quality measure but relevant and interesting patterns can not be detected such as shifting, or scaling patterns. Furthermore, recent papers show that there exist new coherence patterns involved in different kinds of cancer and tumors such as inverse relationships between genes which can not be captured.|Results: The proposed measure is called Spearman's biclustering measure (SBM) which performs an estimation of the quality of a bicluster based on the non-linear correlation among genes and conditions simultaneously. The search of biclusters is performed by using a evolutionary technique called estimation of distribution algorithms which uses the SBM measure as fitness function. This approach has been examined from different points of view by using artificial and real microarrays. The assessment process has involved the use of quality indexes, a set of bicluster patterns of reference including new patterns and a set of statistical tests. It has been also examined the performance using real microarrays and comparing to different algorithmic approaches such as Bimax, CC, OPSM, Plaid and xMotifs. Conclusions: SBM shows several advantages such as the ability to recognize more complex coherence patterns such as shifting, scaling and inversion and the capability to selectively marginalize genes and conditions depending on the statistical significance.

In this context the related literature has extensively shown that dynamic time warping is the similarity measure of choice when univariate time series are considered. However, possible statistical coupling among different dimensions make the generalization of this metric to the multivariate case all but obvious. This has ignited the interest of the community in new distance definitions capable of capturing such inter-dimension dependences. In this paper we propose a simple dynamic time warping based distance that finds the best weighted combination between the dependent - where multivariate time series are treated as whole - and independent approaches - where multivariate time series are just a collection of unrelated univariate time series - of the time series to be classified. A benchmark of four heuristic wrappers, namely, simulated annealing, particle swarm optimization, estimation of distribution algorithms and genetic algorithms are used to evolve the set of weighting coefficients towards maximizing the cross-validated predictive score of the classifiers. In this context one of the most recurring classifiers is nearest neighbor. This classifier is couple with a distance that as afore mentioned, in most cases, have been dynamic time warping. The performance of the proposed approach is validated over datasets widely utilized in the related literature, from which it is concluded that the obtained performance gains can be enlarged by properly decoupling the influence of each dimension in the definition of the dependent dynamic time warping distance.",2017
Animal communication of fear and safety related to foraging behavior and fitness: An individual-based modeling approach,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000497253700009,"Bhattacharjee, S, MacPherson, B, Gras, R","Animal communication impacts many kinds of behavior including mating and courtship, escaping from predators and foraging activity. In this article, our investigation focuses primarily on how alarm communication impacts foraging activity, using individual based computer simulations. We used this approach to help resolve a debate in the literature between the risk-allocation hypothesis, which predicts that over time, animals become habituated to alarm communication versus the hypothesis that alarm communication consistently decreases foraging activity to avoid predators. We found that in most cases, alarm communication did indeed decrease foraging activity whereas in other cases, alarm communication resulted in habituation and a gradual increase in foraging activity, suggesting that there is some truth to both hypotheses. Moreover, it is possible that a decrease in foraging as well as habituation in response to alarm communication both contribute to fitness, or more generally, that alarm communication contributes to fitness as opposed to non-communication. Among the communication runs, we found that although there were higher levels of fitness compared with non-communication runs, fitness was higher when communication results in decreased foraging activity vs. runs where communication results in increased foraging activity. Finally, we used a variational autoencoder based estimation of distribution algorithms in conjuction with C4.5 decision trees as a wrapper to discern the features that distinguish communication runs from non-communication runs. In general, communication runs tend to have relatively low population densities, whereas non-communication runs tend to have relatively high population densities, suggesting that the ability to communicate fear obviates the need for prey to stay in close proximity to one another in order to defend against predators. Also a high level of reproductive urgency was observed in individuals with communication ability when the level of fear of predators was low.",2019
Working principles of binary differential evolution,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000501614300006,"Doerr, B and Zheng, WJ","We conduct a first fundamental analysis of the working principles of binary differential evolution (BDE), an optimization heuristic for binary decision variables that was derived by Gong and Tuson (2007) from the very successful classic differential evolution (DE) for continuous optimization. We show that unlike most other optimization paradigms, it is stable in the sense that neutral bit values are sampled with probability close to 1/2 for a long time. This is generally a desirable property, however, it makes it harder to find the optima for decision variables with small influence on the objective function. This can result in an optimization time exponential in the dimension when optimizing simple symmetric functions like OneMax. On the positive side, BDE quickly detects and optimizes the most important decision variables. For example, dominant bits converge to the optimal value in time logarithmic in the population size. This enables BDE to optimize the most important bits very fast. Overall, our results indicate that BDE is an interesting optimization paradigm having characteristics significantly different from classic evolutionary algorithms or estimation-of-distribution algorithms (EDAs).|On the technical side, we observe that the strong stochastic dependencies in the random experiment describing a run of BDE prevent us from proving all desired results with the mathematical rigor that was successfully used in the analysis of other evolutionary algorithms. Inspired by mean-field approaches in statistical physics we propose a more independent variant of BDE, show experimentally its similarity to BDE, and prove some statements rigorously only for the independent variant. Such a semi-rigorous approach might be interesting for other problems in evolutionary computation where purely mathematical methods failed so far. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2020
Faster Optimization Through Genetic Drift,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:001313631000005,"Florescu, C, Kaufmann, M, Schaller, U","The compact Genetic Algorithm (cGA), parameterized by its hypothetical population size K, offers a low-memory alternative to evolving a large offspring population of solutions. It evolves a probability distribution, biasing it towards promising samples. For the classical benchmark ONEMAX, the cGA has two different modes of operation: a conservative one with small step sizes Theta(1/(root n log n)), which is slow but prevents genetic drift, and an aggressive one with large step sizes Theta(1/ log n), in which genetic drift leads to wrong decisions, but those are corrected efficiently. On ONEMAX, an easy hill-climbing problem, both modes lead to optimization times of Theta(n log n) and are thus equally efficient.|In this paper we study how both regimes change when we replace ONEMAX by the harder hill-climbing problem DYNAMIC BINVAL. It turns out that the aggressive mode is not affected and still yields quasi-linear runtime O(n polylog n). However, the conservative mode becomes substantially slower, yielding a runtime of Omega(n(2)), since genetic drift can only be avoided with smaller step sizes of O(1/n). We complement our theoretical results with simulations.",2024
Elitism-based compact genetic algorithms,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000184819400004,"Ahn, CW and Ramakrishna, RS","This paper describes two elitism-based compact genetic algorithms (cGAs)-persistent elitist compact genetic algorithm (pe-cGA), and nonpersistent elitist compact genetic algorithm (ne-cGA). The aim is to design efficient compact-type GAs by treating them as estimation of distribution algorithms ( I EDAs) for solving difficult optimization problems without compromising on memory and computation costs. The idea is to deal with issues connected with lack of memory-inherent disadvantage of cGAs-by allowing a selection pressure that is high enough to offset the disruptive effect of uniform crossover. The point is to properly reconcile the cGA with elitism. The pe-cGA finds a near optimal solution (i.e., a winner) that is maintained as long as other solutions (i.e., competitors) generated from probability vectors are no better. It attempts to adaptively alter the selection pressure according to the degree of problem difficulty by employing only the pair-wise tournament selection strategy. Moreover, it incorporates the equivalent model of the (1 + 1) evolution strategy (ES) with self-adaptive mutation. The pe-cGA, apart from providing a high performance, also reveals the hidden connection between EDAs (e.g., cGA) and ESs (e.g., (1 + 1)-ES). On the other hand, the ne-cGA further improves the performance of the pe-cGA by, avoiding strong elitism that may lead to premature convergence. The ne-cGA comes with all the benefits of the pe-cGA. In addition, it maintains genetic diversity as a bonus. This paper also proposes an analytic model for investigating convergence enhancement (i.e., speedup).|Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms, ne-cGA in particular, generally exhibit a better quality of solution and a higher rate of convergence for most of the problems than do the existing cGA, sGA, and (1 + 1) -ES. The speedup model has been verified by experiments. The results also show that an adequate alleviation of elitism further improves the solution quality, as well as the convergence speed.",2003
Bayesian Optimization Algorithm Applied to Uncertainty Quantification,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000309147700017,"Abdollahzadeh, A, Reynolds, A, Williams, G","Prudent decision making in subsurface assets requires reservoir uncertainty quantification. In a typical uncertainty-quantification study, reservoir models must be updated using the observed response from the reservoir by a process known as history matching. This involves solving an inverse problem, finding reservoir models that produce, under simulation, a similar response to that of the real reservoir. However, this requires multiple expensive multiphase-flow simulations. Thus, uncertainty-quantification studies employ optimization techniques to find acceptable models to be used in prediction. Different optimization algorithms and search strategies are presented in the literature, but they are generally unsatisfactory because of slow convergence to the optimal regions of the global search space, and, more importantly, failure in finding multiple acceptable reservoir models. In this context, a new approach is offered by estimation-of-distribution algorithms (EDAs). EDAs are population-based algorithms that use models to estimate the probability distribution of promising solutions and then generate new candidate solutions.|This paper explores the application of EDAs, including univariate and multivariate models. We discuss two histogram-based univariate models and one multivariate model, the Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA), which employs Bayesian networks for modeling. By considering possible interactions between variables and exploiting explicitly stored knowledge of such interactions, EDAs can accelerate the search process while preserving search diversity. Unlike most existing approaches applied to uncertainty quantification, the Bayesian network allows the BOA to build solutions using flexible rules learned from the models obtained, rather than fixed rules, leading to better solutions and improved convergence. The BOA is naturally suited to finding good solutions in complex high-dimensional spaces, such as those typical in reservoir-uncertainty quantification.|We demonstrate the effectiveness of EDA by applying the well-known synthetic PUNQ-S3 case with multiple wells. This allows us to verify the methodology in a well-controlled case. Results show better estimation of uncertainty when compared with some other traditional population-based algorithms.",2012
Microgrids energy management considering net-zero energy concept: The role of renewable energy landscaping design and IoT modeling in digital twin realistic simulator,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:001178584200001,"Wu, P and Mei, XQ","The research at hand leverages an affordable Intelligent Communication System (ICS) integrated with the Internet of Things (IoT) to implement an Optimum Energy Management Program (EMP) for a unified system comprising photovoltaics (PVs), biogases, and Vanadium Redox Flow Battery storage (VRFBS) within a Smart Islanded Hybrid Microgrid (HMG) network. The proposed EMP and control framework are structured around four essential components: (i) Real-time Energy Data Collection: Inexpensive energy meters gather energy data from various renewable sources, VRFBS, utility, and loads, ensuring comprehensive real-time monitoring. (ii) Monitoring and Control: MODBUS on TCP/IP and Raspberry-Pi platforms facilitate monitoring, control, and fault detection, ensuring seamless operation and fault mitigation. (iii) Cloud-Enabled Remote Monitoring: The system employs Message Alignment Telemetry Transference (MATT) servers and ThingSpeak Middleware to establish a Cloud-enabled Remote Monitoring Unit (RMU), enhancing accessibility and remote monitoring capabilities. (iv) Biogas and VRFBS Control: The system measures biogas generation and automates control of biogas engine generators, while enabling scheduled modifications of VRFBS requisition, ensuring optimal energy utilization. An integrated Hybrid Microgrid, comprising a 10 kWP PV system, a 15kVA biogas unit, and a 6 kWh VRFBS, has been designed to efficiently manage energy requisition and prevent power losses during dynamic load profiles. This configuration validates the efficacy of the proposed ICS. The EMP's performance is rigorously evaluated across three distinct scenarios, demonstrating its ability to utilize PV power during daytime outages and support critical loads by connecting biogas power generators during grid outages. The modelled IoT sensors and renewable landscape design within the digital twin simulator enhance the system's predictive capabilities and decision-making processes. This study marks a significant advancement, presenting a cost-effective and versatile solution through Smart Islanded Hybrid Microgrids. These microgrids offer enhanced energy security for large communities, making them a practical alternative to existing technologies.

Problem of Domain/Building Block Preservation in the Evolution of Biological Macromolecules and Evolutionary Computation,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000965674700052,"Spirov, AV and Myasnikova, EM","Structurally and functionally isolated domains in biological macromolecular evolution, both natural and artificial, are largely similar to ""schemata"", building blocks (BBs), in evolutionary computation (EC). The problem of preserving in subsequent evolutionary searches the already found domains / BBs is well known and quite relevant in biology as well as in EC. Both biology and EC are seeing parallel and independent development of several approaches to identifying and preserving previously identified domains / BBs. First, we notice the similarity of DNA shuffling methods in synthetic biology and multi-parent recombination algorithms in EC. Furthermore, approaches to computer identification of domains in proteins that are being developed in biology can be aligned with BB identification methods in EC. Finally, approaches to chimeric protein libraries optimization in biology can be compared to evolutionary search methods based on probabilistic models in EC. We propose to validate the prospects of mutual exchange of ideas and transfer of algorithms and approaches between evolutionary systems biology and EC in these three principal directions. A crucial aim of this transfer is the design of new advanced experimental techniques capable of solving more complex problems of in vitro evolution.",2023
Explaining a Staff Rostering Genetic Algorithm using Sensitivity Analysis and Trajectory Analysis,Full Text @ UPM,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:001117972600274,"Fyvie, M, McCall, JAW, Brownlee, AEI","In the field of Explainable AI, population-based search metaheuristics are of growing interest as they become more widely used in critical applications. The ability to relate key information regarding algorithm behaviour and drivers of solution quality to an end-user is vital. This paper investigates a novel method of explanatory feature extraction based on analysis of the search trajectory and compares the results to those of sensitivity analysis using ""Weighted Ranked Biased Overlap"". We apply these techniques to search trajectories generated by a genetic algorithm as it solves a staff rostering problem. We show that there is a significant overlap between these two explainability methods when identifying subsets of rostered workers whose allocations are responsible for large portions of fitness change in an optimization run. Both methods identify similar patterns in sensitivity, but our method also draws out additional information. As the search progresses, the techniques reveal how individual workers increase or decrease in the influence on the overall rostering solution's quality. Our method also helps identify workers with a lower impact on overall solution fitness and at what stage in the search these individuals can be considered highly flexible in their roster assignment.",2023
