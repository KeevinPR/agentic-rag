        "authors": "Zhou, Aimin Zhang, Qingfu Jin, Yaochu",
        "description": "Most existing multiobjective evolutionary algorithms aim at approximating the Pareto front (PF), which is the distribution of the Pareto-optimal solutions in the objective space. In many real-life applications, however, a good approximation to the Pareto set (PS), which is the distribution of the Pareto-optimal solutions in the decision space, is also required by a decision maker. This paper considers a class of multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs), in which the dimensionalities of the PS and the PF manifolds are different so that a good approximation to the PF might not approximate the PS very well. It proposes a probabilistic model-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm, called MMEA, for approximating the PS and the PF simultaneously for an MOP in this class. In the modeling phase of MMEA, the population is clustered into a number of subpopulations based on their distribution in the objective space, the principal component analysis technique is used to estimate the dimensionality of the PS manifold in each subpopulation, and then a probabilistic model is built for modeling the distribution of the Pareto-optimal solutions in the decision space. Such a modeling procedure could promote the population diversity in both the decision and objective spaces. MMEA is compared with three other methods, KP1, Omni-Optimizer and RM-MEDA, on a set of test instances, five of which are proposed in this paper. The experimental results clearly suggest that, overall, MMEA performs significantly better than the three compared algorithms in approximating both the PS and the PF.",

        "description": "In this paper, a new method is proposed to overcome the problem of local optima traps in a class of evolutionary algorithms, called estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), in real-valued function optimization. The Duple-EDA framework is proposed in which not only the current best solutions but also the search history are modeled, so that long-term feedback can be taken into account. Sample Density Balancing (SDB) is proposed under the framework to alleviate the drift phenomenon in EDA. A selection scheme based on Pareto ranking considering both the fitness and the historical sample density is adopted, which prevents the algorithm from repeatedly sampling in a small region and directs it to explore potentially optimal regions, thus helps it avoid being stuck into local optima. An MBOA (mixed Bayesian optimization algorithm) version of the framework is implemented and tested on several benchmark problems. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms a standard niching method in these benchmark problems.",

Once the network is trapped in local minima, the perturbation based on EDA can generate a new starting point for DCHNN for further search. It is expected that the further search is guided to a promising area by the probability model. Thus, the proposed algorithm can escape from local minima and further search better results. The proposed algorithm is tested on 120 benchmark problems with the size ranging from 100 to 5000.

Recently, the application of probabilistic techniques to program and function evolution has received increasing attention, and this approach promises to provide a strong alternative to the traditional genetic programming techniques. Although a probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) is a widely used model for probabilistic program evolution, a conventional PCFG is not suitable for estimating interactions among nodes because of the context freedom assumption. In this paper, we have proposed a new evolutionary algorithm named programming with annotated grammar estimation based on a PCFG with latent annotations, which allows this context freedom assumption to be weakened. By applying the proposed algorithm to several computational problems, it is demonstrated that our approach is markedly more effective at estimating building blocks than prior approaches.",

        "description": "This paper is concerned with the Indian design of a 220 MWe Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor having Natural Uranium fuel and heavy water as moderator and coolant. At the beginning of life, it is necessary to flatten the power by loading some Thorium bundles to achieve a nearly full power operation. The determination of best possible locations of Thorium bundles, which maximize fuel economy as well as safety, is a complex combinatorial optimization problem. About two decades ago, an optimum configuration of Thorium bundles was successfully arrived at by using a gradient based method and this pattern was actually loaded in the Indian PHWR at Kakrapar which went critical in 1992 [Balakrishnan, K., Kakodkar, A, 1994. Optimization of the initial fuel loading of the Indian PHWR with Thorium bundles for achieving full power. Annals of Nuclear Energy 21, 1-9]. Here, the same problem is revisited for two reasons. Firstly. computational techniques based on completely different philosophy namely \"Genetic Algorithm\" (GA) and \"Estimation of Distribution Algorithm\" (EDA) have been used. Secondly, the enormous increase in computing power during the last two decades is expected to provide a more exhaustive search. Indeed, it has been possible to find out many feasible Thorium configurations of comparable merit. Our results are similar with the result of the earlier BARC study but provide a range of additional configurations. As in earlier BARC work, we find that one can get from 95% to 97% full power without violating various safety aspects such as maximum bundle power, maximum channel power. channel outlet temperature and worth of the two shutdown systems. In the present work, the number of Thorium bundles which can be loaded range from 22 to 34. One of the outcomes of this study is that the computational techniques suitable for this type of problems have been identified and developed. Further studies involving the use of some other evolutionary methods and problems such as optimization of depleted Uranium loading are in progress. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

However, with the advent of new technologies in the manufacturing systems, limited capacity storage between machines has become profitable. Aimed at makespan minimization, the flowshop scheduling problem with buffer constraints is NP-hard in the strong sense. Therefore, several approximate algorithms have been proposed in the literature. In this chapter, we propose an Estimation of Distribution Algorithm for solving a flowshop scheduling problem with buffer constraints. The main characteristics of the problem, such as the order of jobs and similar blocks of jobs in the sequence, are taken into account while building the probabilistic model. In order to enrich the search procedure of the algorithm, a skewed variable neighbourhood search algorithm is embedded into it, restricted by a calculated probability which depends on the quality of the created offspring. The computational results show that our algorithm outperforms genetic algorithm and particle swarm algorithm, and can obtain several optimal solutions in a short time.",

Various algorithms have been proposed to tackle this challenging problem, but the use of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) to it is rare. This chapter aims at investigating the behavior and performances of univariate EDAs mixed with different kernel probability densities via fitness landscape analysis. Based on the analysis, a self-adaptive uni-variate EDA with mixed kernels (MUEDA) is proposed. To assess the effectiveness and efficiency of MUEDA, function optimization tasks with dimension scaling from 30 to 1500 are adopted. Compared to the recently published LSGO algorithms, MUEDA shows excellent convergence speed, final solution quality and dimensional scalability.",

        "description": "Applying Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) to solve continuous problems is a significant and challenging task in the field of evolutionary computation. So far, various continuous EDAs have been developed based on different probability models. Initially, the EDAs based on a single Gaussian probability model are widely used but they have trouble in solving multimodal problems. Later EDAs based on a mixture model and on a clustering technique are then introduced to conquer such drawback. However, they are either time consuming or need prior knowledge of the problems. Recently, the histogram has begun to be used in continuous EDAs, but the histogram based EDAs (HEDAs) usually need too much time and space to gain a highly accurate solution. On the basis of pioneering contributions, this paper proposes a fuzzy histogram based EDA (FHEDA) for continuous optimization. In the FHEDA, the estimated range of the fuzzy histogram is adjusted adaptively by the current promising solutions, which leads the algorithm to search good solutions efficiently. A mutation mechanism is also introduced in the sampling operation to avoid being trapped in local optima. The performance of the proposed FHEDA is evaluated by testing seven benchmark functions with different characteristics. Two Gaussian based EDAs and the sur-shr-HEDA are studied for comparison. The results show that among all experimental algorithms, the FHEDA can give comparatively satisfying performance on unimodal and multimodal functions.",

DE and EDA can be extended to multi-objective optimization problems by using a Pareto-based approach, called Pareto DE (PDE) and Pareto EDA (PEDA) respectively. In this study, we describe a novel combination of PDE and PEDA (PDE-PEDA) for multi-objective optimization problems by taking advantage of the global searching ability of PEDA and the local optimizing ability of PDE, which can, effectively, maintain the balance between exploration and exploitation. The basic idea is that the offspring population of PDE-PEDA is composed of two parts, one part of the trial solution generated originates from PDE and the other part is sampled in the search space from the constructed probabilistic distribution model of PEDA. A scaling factor Pr used to balance contributions of PDE and PEDA can be adjusted in an on-line manner using a simulated annealing method. At an early evolutionary stage, a larger Pr should be adopted to ensure PEDA is used more frequently, whereas at later stage, a smaller Pr should be adopted to ensure that offspring is generated more often using PDE. The hybrid algorithm is evaluated on a set of benchmark problems and the experimental results show that PDE-PEDA outperforms the NSGA-II and PDE algorithms.",

        "description": "Objectives: The \"large k (genes), small N (samples)\" phenomenon complicates the problem of microarray classification with logistic regression. The indeterminacy of the maximum likelihood solutions, multicollinearity of predictor variables and data over-fitting cause unstable parameter estimates. Moreover, computational problems arise due to the large number of predictor (genes) variables. Regularized logistic regression excels as a solution. However, the difficulties found here involve an objective function hard to be optimized from a mathematical viewpoint and a careful required tuning of the regularization parameters.|Methods: Those difficulties are tackled by introducing a new way of regularizing the logistic regression. Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), a kind of evolutionary algorithms, emerge as natural regularizers. Obtaining the regularized estimates of the logistic classifier amounts to maximizing the likelihood function via our EDA, without having to be penalized. Likelihood penalties add a number of difficulties to the resulting optimization problems, which vanish in our case. Simulation of new estimates during the evolutionary process of EDAs is performed in such a way that guarantees their shrinkage while maintaining their probabilistic dependence relationships learnt. The EDA process is embedded in an adapted recursive feature elimination procedure, thereby providing the genes that are best markers for the classification.|Results: The consistency with the literature and excellent classification performance achieved with our algorithm are illustrated on four microarray data sets: Breast, Colon, Leukemia and Prostate. Details on the last two data sets are available as supplementary material.|Conclusions: We have introduced a novel EDA-based logistic regression regularizer. It implicitly shrinks the coefficients during EDA evolution process while optimizing the usual likelihood function. The approach is combined with a gene subset selection procedure and automatically tunes the required parameters. Empirical results on microarray data sets provide sparse models with confirmed genes and performing better in classification than other competing regularized methods.",

        "description": "Most estimation of distribution algorithms only make use of some high quality individuals and neglect other low quality individuals. However like high quality individuals, these neglected low quality individuals also contain some important information that may be useful for guiding the search of estimation of distribution algorithms. This paper proposes a novel kind of estimation of distribution algorithms, where both high quality and low quality individuals in the old population are employed for reproducing new candidate individuals at the next generation. In particular, both the density P-H(X) of high quality individuals and the density P-L(X) of low quality individuals are estimated; then the new population G is obtained with the following steps employed: 1) a new candidate individual x is reproduced through sampling from the density P-H(X); 2) to let P-H(X = x) and P-L(X = x) compare and the individual x will be stored into the new population G if and only if P-H(X = x) >= P-L(X = x); 3) the above steps repeat until M new individuals have been successfully generated where M is the population size.|To demonstrate the usefulness of low quality individuals for estimation of distribution algorithms, estimation of distribution algorithms using both high quality and low quality individuals are tested on several benchmark problems and their results are compared with those obtained by estimation of distribution algorithms where only high quality individuals are used. The usefulness of low quality individuals for speeding up the search of estimation of distribution algorithms is confirmed by the experimental results.",

This paper proposes a new framework for evolutionary algorithms, which combines a simple EDA based on order 1 statistics and a clustering technique in order to avoid the high computational cost required by higher order EDAs. The algorithm uses clustering to group genotypically similar solutions, relying that different clusters focus on different substructures and the combination of information from different clusters effectively combines substructures.

In other words, they do not learn the structure of the problem and assume that it is known in advance. Therefore, they may not be classified as full estimation of distribution algorithms. This work presents a fully multivariate DEUM algorithm that can automatically learn the undirected structure of the problem, automatically find the cliques from the structure and automatically estimate a joint probability model of the Markov network. This model is then sampled using Monte Carlo samplers. The proposed DEUM algorithm can be applied to any general optimisation problem even when the structure is not known.",

Both spikes and input features in ipESNN are represented as quantum bits being in a superposition of two states (I and 0) defined by a probability density function. This representation allows for the state of an entire ipESNN at any time to be represented probabilistically in a quantum bit register and probabilistically optimised until convergence using quantum gate operators and a fitness function. The proposed ipESNN is a promising framework for both engineering applications and brain data modeling as it offers faster and more efficient feature selection and model optimization in a large dimensional space in addition to revealing new knowledge that is not possible to obtain using other models.

However, an aspect not yet widely addressed by the research reported in the literature is the lack of ability of the AlSs to deal effectively with building blocks (partial high-quality solutions coded in the antibody). The available AlSs present mechanisms for evolving the population that do not take into account the relationship among the variables of the problem, potentially causing the disruption of high-quality partial solutions. This paper proposes a novel AIS with abilities to identify and properly manipulate building blocks in optimization problems. Instead of using cloning and mutation to generate new individuals, our algorithm builds a probabilistic model representing the joint probability distribution of the promising solutions and, subsequently, uses this model for sampling new solutions. The probabilistic model used is a Bayesian network due to its capability of properly capturing the most relevant interactions among the variables. Therefore, our algorithm, called Bayesian Artificial Immune System (BAIS), represents a significant attempt to improve the performance of immune-inspired algorithms when dealing with building blocks, and hence to solve efficiently hard optimization problems with complex interactions among the variables. The performance of BAIS compares favorably with that produced by contenders such as state-of-the-art Estimation of Distribution Algorithms. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

        "description": "Many real-world problems involve the coordination of multiple agents in dynamic environments, where characteristics of the problem being solved change over time. In such problems, adaptive, self-organizing agent approaches have been shown to provide very robust solutions. However, these approaches often require non-trivial amounts of time to respond to large environmental shifts. Considering this limitation, we observe that environmental changes in a given dynamic problem are generally not completely random; similar states in the environment tend to reappear over time. Memory is one way to leverage this past information and improve the adaptive efficiency of the agent system. In this paper, we explore the use of memory as a means of boosting the performance of self-organizing agents in solving dynamic coordination problems. We consider the specific problem of coordinating product flows in a factory that is subject to changing job mixes over time, which has been previously solved using a computational model of the task allocation behavior of wasps. We augment this base procedure with a number of memory systems, the most sophisticated of which exploit memory models inspired by estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) to manage computational cost. An experimental analysis is presented which demonstrates the advantage of using memory. Configurations using the EDA-inspired memory models are shown to substantially outperform configurations with more standard and infinite-sized memory models, and all are shown to improve the performance of the baseline task allocation procedure.",

        "description": "Bayesian networks can be used as a model to make inferences in domains with intrinsic uncertainty, that is, to determine the probability distribution of a set of variables given the instantiation of another set. The inference is an NP-hard problem. There are several algorithms to make exact and approximate inference. One of the most popular, and that is also an exact method. is the evidence propagation algorithm of Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter [S.L. Lauritzen, D.J. Spiegelhalter, Local computations with probabilities on graphical structures and their application on expert systems, journal of the Royal Statistical Society B 50 (2) (1988) 157-224], improved later by Jensen et al. [F.V. Jensen, S.L. Lauritzen, K.G. Olesen, Bayesian updating in causal probabilistic networks by local computations, In Computational Statistics Quaterly 4 (1990) 269-282]. This algorithm needs an ordering of the variables in order to make the triangulation of the moral graph associated with the original Bayesian network structure. The effectiveness of the inference depends on the variable ordering. In this paper, we will use a new paradigm for evolutionary computation, the estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), to get the optimal ordering of the variables to obtain the most efficient triangulation. We will also present a new type of evolutionary algorithm, the recursive EDAs (REDAs). We will prove that REDAs improve the behaviour of EDAs in this particular problem, and that their results are competitive with other triangulation techniques. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

        "description": "Objectives: The \"large k (genes), small N (samples)\" phenomenon complicates the problem of microarray classification with logistic regression. The indeterminacy of the maximum likelihood solutions, multicollinearity of predictor variables and data over-fitting cause unstable parameter estimates. Moreover, computational problems arise due to the large number of predictor (genes) variables. Regularized logistic regression excels as a solution. However, the difficulties found here involve an objective function hard to be optimized from a mathematical viewpoint and a careful required tuning of the regularization parameters.|Methods: Those difficulties are tackled by introducing a new way of regularizing the logistic regression. Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), a kind of evolutionary algorithms, emerge as natural regularizers. Obtaining the regularized estimates of the logistic classifier amounts to maximizing the likelihood function via our EDA, without having to be penalized. Likelihood penalties add a number of difficulties to the resulting optimization problems, which vanish in our case. Simulation of new estimates during the evolutionary process of EDAs is performed in such a way that guarantees their shrinkage while maintaining their probabilistic dependence relationships learnt. The EDA process is embedded in an adapted recursive feature elimination procedure, thereby providing the genes that are best markers for the classification.|Results: The consistency with the literature and excellent classification performance achieved with our algorithm are illustrated on four microarray data sets: Breast, Colon, Leukemia and Prostate. Details on the last two data sets are available as supplementary material.|Conclusions: We have introduced a novel EDA-based logistic regression regularizer. It implicitly shrinks the coefficients during EDA evolution process while optimizing the usual likelihood function. The approach is combined with a gene subset selection procedure and automatically tunes the required parameters. Empirical results on microarray data sets provide sparse models with confirmed genes and performing better in classification than other competing regularized methods.",

Non-exclusive groupings are required, since a gene may play more than one biological role. Gene Shaving [Hastie, T., et al. (2000). Gene Shaving as a method for identifying distinct sets of genes with similar expression. Genome Biology, 1, 1-21] is a popular clustering algorithm which looks for coherent clusters of genes with high variance across samples, allowing overlapping among the clusters.|Method: In this paper, we present an intelligent system for analyzing microarray data. Our system implements three novel non-exclusive approaches for clustering and biclustering whose aim is to find coherent groups of genes with large between-sample variance: EDA-Clustering and EDA-Biclustering, based on Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDA), and Gene-&-Sample Shaving, a biclustering algorithm based on Principal Components Analysis.|Results: We integrated the three proposed methods into a web-based platform and tested their performance on two real datasets. The obtained results outperform Gene Shaving in terms of quality and size of revealed patterns.

However like high quality individuals, these neglected low quality individuals also contain some important information that may be useful for guiding the search of estimation of distribution algorithms. This paper proposes a novel kind of estimation of distribution algorithms, where both high quality and low quality individuals in the old population are employed for reproducing new candidate individuals at the next generation. In particular, both the density P-H(X) of high quality individuals and the density P-L(X) of low quality individuals are estimated; then the new population G is obtained with the following steps employed: 1) a new candidate individual x is reproduced through sampling from the density P-H(X); 2) to let P-H(X = x) and P-L(X = x) compare and the individual x will be stored into the new population G if and only if P-H(X = x) >= P-L(X = x); 3) the above steps repeat until M new individuals have been successfully generated where M is the population size.|To demonstrate the usefulness of low quality individuals for estimation of distribution algorithms, estimation of distribution algorithms using both high quality and low quality individuals are tested on several benchmark problems and their results are compared with those obtained by estimation of distribution algorithms where only high quality individuals are used. The usefulness of low quality individuals for speeding up the search of estimation of distribution algorithms is confirmed by the experimental results.",

The algorithm uses clustering to group genotypically similar solutions, relying that different clusters focus on different substructures and the combination of information from different clusters effectively combines substructures.

Secondly, an improved backtracking repairing algorithm is proposed to repair invalid individuals sampled by the probabilistic model of EDAs for the long sequence protein instances. A detection procedure of feasibility is added to avoid entering invalid closed areas when selecting directions for the residues.

The paper introduces a new framework of iECOS called integrative probabilistic evolving spiking neural networks (ipSNN) that incorporate probability learning, parameters. ipSNN utilize a quantum inspired evolutionary optimization algorithm to optimize the probability parameters as these algorithms belong to the class of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDA). Both spikes and input features in ipESNN are represented as quantum bits being in a superposition of two states (I and 0) defined by a probability density function. This representation allows for the state of an entire ipESNN at any time to be represented probabilistically in a quantum bit register and probabilistically optimised until convergence using quantum gate operators and a fitness function. The proposed ipESNN is a promising framework for both engineering applications and brain data modeling as it offers faster and more efficient feature selection and model optimization in a large dimensional space in addition to revealing new knowledge that is not possible to obtain using other models. Further development of ipESNN are the neuro-genetic models - ipESNG, that are introduced too, along with open research questions.",

        "description": "Significant progress has been made in theory and design of Artificial Immune Systems (AISs) for solving hard problems accurately. However, an aspect not yet widely addressed by the research reported in the literature is the lack of ability of the AlSs to deal effectively with building blocks (partial high-quality solutions coded in the antibody). The available AlSs present mechanisms for evolving the population that do not take into account the relationship among the variables of the problem, potentially causing the disruption of high-quality partial solutions. This paper proposes a novel AIS with abilities to identify and properly manipulate building blocks in optimization problems. Instead of using cloning and mutation to generate new individuals, our algorithm builds a probabilistic model representing the joint probability distribution of the promising solutions and, subsequently, uses this model for sampling new solutions. The probabilistic model used is a Bayesian network due to its capability of properly capturing the most relevant interactions among the variables. Therefore, our algorithm, called Bayesian Artificial Immune System (BAIS), represents a significant attempt to improve the performance of immune-inspired algorithms when dealing with building blocks, and hence to solve efficiently hard optimization problems with complex interactions among the variables. The performance of BAIS compares favorably with that produced by contenders such as state-of-the-art Estimation of Distribution Algorithms. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

        "authors": "Barlow, GJ and Smith, SF",
        "description": "Many real-world problems involve the coordination of multiple agents in dynamic environments, where characteristics of the problem being solved change over time. In such problems, adaptive, self-organizing agent approaches have been shown to provide very robust solutions. However, these approaches often require non-trivial amounts of time to respond to large environmental shifts. Considering this limitation, we observe that environmental changes in a given dynamic problem are generally not completely random; similar states in the environment tend to reappear over time. Memory is one way to leverage this past information and improve the adaptive efficiency of the agent system. In this paper, we explore the use of memory as a means of boosting the performance of self-organizing agents in solving dynamic coordination problems. We consider the specific problem of coordinating product flows in a factory that is subject to changing job mixes over time, which has been previously solved using a computational model of the task allocation behavior of wasps. We augment this base procedure with a number of memory systems, the most sophisticated of which exploit memory models inspired by estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) to manage computational cost. An experimental analysis is presented which demonstrates the advantage of using memory. Configurations using the EDA-inspired memory models are shown to substantially outperform configurations with more standard and infinite-sized memory models, and all are shown to improve the performance of the baseline task allocation procedure.",

The inference is an NP-hard problem. There are several algorithms to make exact and approximate inference. One of the most popular, and that is also an exact method. is the evidence propagation algorithm of Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter [S.L. Lauritzen, D.J. Spiegelhalter, Local computations with probabilities on graphical structures and their application on expert systems, journal of the Royal Statistical Society B 50 (2) (1988) 157-224], improved later by Jensen et al.

This algorithm needs an ordering of the variables in order to make the triangulation of the moral graph associated with the original Bayesian network structure. The effectiveness of the inference depends on the variable ordering. In this paper, we will use a new paradigm for evolutionary computation, the estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), to get the optimal ordering of the variables to obtain the most efficient triangulation. We will also present a new type of evolutionary algorithm, the recursive EDAs (REDAs). We will prove that REDAs improve the behaviour of EDAs in this particular problem, and that their results are competitive with other triangulation techniques. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

        "description": "Objectives: The \"large k (genes), small N (samples)\" phenomenon complicates the problem of microarray classification with logistic regression. The indeterminacy of the maximum likelihood solutions, multicollinearity of predictor variables and data over-fitting cause unstable parameter estimates. Moreover, computational problems arise due to the large number of predictor (genes) variables. Regularized logistic regression excels as a solution. However, the difficulties found here involve an objective function hard to be optimized from a mathematical viewpoint and a careful required tuning of the regularization parameters.|Methods: Those difficulties are tackled by introducing a new way of regularizing the logistic regression. Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), a kind of evolutionary algorithms, emerge as natural regularizers. Obtaining the regularized estimates of the logistic classifier amounts to maximizing the likelihood function via our EDA, without having to be penalized. Likelihood penalties add a number of difficulties to the resulting optimization problems, which vanish in our case. Simulation of new estimates during the evolutionary process of EDAs is performed in such a way that guarantees their shrinkage while maintaining their probabilistic dependence relationships learnt. The EDA process is embedded in an adapted recursive feature elimination procedure, thereby providing the genes that are best markers for the classification.|Results: The consistency with the literature and excellent classification performance achieved with our algorithm are illustrated on four microarray data sets: Breast, Colon, Leukemia and Prostate. Details on the last two data sets are available as supplementary material.|Conclusions: We have introduced a novel EDA-based logistic regression regularizer. It implicitly shrinks the coefficients during EDA evolution process while optimizing the usual likelihood function. The approach is combined with a gene subset selection procedure and automatically tunes the required parameters. Empirical results on microarray data sets provide sparse models with confirmed genes and performing better in classification than other competing regularized methods.",

Non-exclusive groupings are required, since a gene may play more than one biological role. Gene Shaving [Hastie, T., et al. (2000). Gene Shaving as a method for identifying distinct sets of genes with similar expression. Genome Biology, 1, 1-21] is a popular clustering algorithm which looks for coherent clusters of genes with high variance across samples, allowing overlapping among the clusters.|Method: In this paper, we present an intelligent system for analyzing microarray data. Our system implements three novel non-exclusive approaches for clustering and biclustering whose aim is to find coherent groups of genes with large between-sample variance: EDA-Clustering and EDA-Biclustering, based on Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDA), and Gene-&-Sample Shaving, a biclustering algorithm based on Principal Components Analysis.|Results: We integrated the three proposed methods into a web-based platform and tested their performance on two real datasets.

However like high quality individuals, these neglected low quality individuals also contain some important information that may be useful for guiding the search of estimation of distribution algorithms. This paper proposes a novel kind of estimation of distribution algorithms, where both high quality and low quality individuals in the old population are employed for reproducing new candidate individuals at the next generation. In particular, both the density P-H(X) of high quality individuals and the density P-L(X) of low quality individuals are estimated; then the new population G is obtained with the following steps employed: 1) a new candidate individual x is reproduced through sampling from the density P-H(X); 2) to let P-H(X = x) and P-L(X = x) compare and the individual x will be stored into the new population G if and only if P-H(X = x) >= P-L(X = x); 3) the above steps repeat until M new individuals have been successfully generated where M is the population size.|To demonstrate the usefulness of low quality individuals for estimation of distribution algorithms, estimation of distribution algorithms using both high quality and low quality individuals are tested on several benchmark problems and their results are compared with those obtained by estimation of distribution algorithms where only high quality individuals are used. The usefulness of low quality individuals for speeding up the search of estimation of distribution algorithms is confirmed by the experimental results.",

This paper clearly establishes that QEA is an original algorithm that belongs to the class of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), while the common points and specifics of QEA compared to other EDAs are highlighted. The behavior of a versatile QEA relatively to three classical EDAs is extensively studied and comparatively good results are reported in terms of loss of diversity, scalability, solution quality, and robustness to fitness noise. To better understand QEA, two main advantages of the multimodel approach are analyzed in details. First, it is shown that QEA can dynamically adapt the learning speed leading to a smooth and robust convergence behavior. Second, we demonstrate that QEA manipulates more complex distributions of solutions than with a single model approach leading to more efficient optimization of problems with interacting variables.",

Firstly, a composite fitness function containing the information of folding structure core formation is introduced to replace the traditional fitness function of RP model. It can help to select more optimum individuals for probabilistic model of EDAs algorithm. And a set of guided operators are used to increase the diversity of population and the likelihood of escaping from local optima. Secondly, an improved backtracking repairing algorithm is proposed to repair invalid individuals sampled by the probabilistic model of EDAs for the long sequence protein instances. A detection procedure of feasibility is added to avoid entering invalid closed areas when selecting directions for the residues. Thus, it can significant reduce the number of backtracking operation and the computational cost for long sequence protein.

The paper introduces a new framework of iECOS called integrative probabilistic evolving spiking neural networks (ipSNN) that incorporate probability learning, parameters. ipSNN utilize a quantum inspired evolutionary optimization algorithm to optimize the probability parameters as these algorithms belong to the class of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDA). Both spikes and input features in ipESNN are represented as quantum bits being in a superposition of two states (I and 0) defined by a probability density function. This representation allows for the state of an entire ipESNN at any time to be represented probabilistically in a quantum bit register and probabilistically optimised until convergence using quantum gate operators and a fitness function. The proposed ipESNN is a promising framework for both engineering applications and brain data modeling as it offers faster and more efficient feature selection and model optimization in a large dimensional space in addition to revealing new knowledge that is not possible to obtain using other models.

        "description": "Significant progress has been made in theory and design of Artificial Immune Systems (AISs) for solving hard problems accurately. However, an aspect not yet widely addressed by the research reported in the literature is the lack of ability of the AlSs to deal effectively with building blocks (partial high-quality solutions coded in the antibody). The available AlSs present mechanisms for evolving the population that do not take into account the relationship among the variables of the problem, potentially causing the disruption of high-quality partial solutions. This paper proposes a novel AIS with abilities to identify and properly manipulate building blocks in optimization problems. Instead of using cloning and mutation to generate new individuals, our algorithm builds a probabilistic model representing the joint probability distribution of the promising solutions and, subsequently, uses this model for sampling new solutions. The probabilistic model used is a Bayesian network due to its capability of properly capturing the most relevant interactions among the variables. Therefore, our algorithm, called Bayesian Artificial Immune System (BAIS), represents a significant attempt to improve the performance of immune-inspired algorithms when dealing with building blocks, and hence to solve efficiently hard optimization problems with complex interactions among the variables. The performance of BAIS compares favorably with that produced by contenders such as state-of-the-art Estimation of Distribution Algorithms. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

        "description": "Many real-world problems involve the coordination of multiple agents in dynamic environments, where characteristics of the problem being solved change over time. In such problems, adaptive, self-organizing agent approaches have been shown to provide very robust solutions. However, these approaches often require non-trivial amounts of time to respond to large environmental shifts. Considering this limitation, we observe that environmental changes in a given dynamic problem are generally not completely random; similar states in the environment tend to reappear over time. Memory is one way to leverage this past information and improve the adaptive efficiency of the agent system. In this paper, we explore the use of memory as a means of boosting the performance of self-organizing agents in solving dynamic coordination problems. We consider the specific problem of coordinating product flows in a factory that is subject to changing job mixes over time, which has been previously solved using a computational model of the task allocation behavior of wasps. We augment this base procedure with a number of memory systems, the most sophisticated of which exploit memory models inspired by estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) to manage computational cost. An experimental analysis is presented which demonstrates the advantage of using memory. Configurations using the EDA-inspired memory models are shown to substantially outperform configurations with more standard and infinite-sized memory models, and all are shown to improve the performance of the baseline task allocation procedure.",

The inference is an NP-hard problem. There are several algorithms to make exact and approximate inference. One of the most popular, and that is also an exact method. is the evidence propagation algorithm of Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter [S.L. Lauritzen, D.J.

This algorithm needs an ordering of the variables in order to make the triangulation of the moral graph associated with the original Bayesian network structure. The effectiveness of the inference depends on the variable ordering. In this paper, we will use a new paradigm for evolutionary computation, the estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), to get the optimal ordering of the variables to obtain the most efficient triangulation. We will also present a new type of evolutionary algorithm, the recursive EDAs (REDAs). We will prove that REDAs improve the behaviour of EDAs in this particular problem, and that their results are competitive with other triangulation techniques. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

        "description": "Objectives: The \"large k (genes), small N (samples)\" phenomenon complicates the problem of microarray classification with logistic regression. The indeterminacy of the maximum likelihood solutions, multicollinearity of predictor variables and data over-fitting cause unstable parameter estimates. Moreover, computational problems arise due to the large number of predictor (genes) variables. Regularized logistic regression excels as a solution. However, the difficulties found here involve an objective function hard to be optimized from a mathematical viewpoint and a careful required tuning of the regularization parameters.|Methods: Those difficulties are tackled by introducing a new way of regularizing the logistic regression. Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), a kind of evolutionary algorithms, emerge as natural regularizers. Obtaining the regularized estimates of the logistic classifier amounts to maximizing the likelihood function via our EDA, without having to be penalized. Likelihood penalties add a number of difficulties to the resulting optimization problems, which vanish in our case. Simulation of new estimates during the evolutionary process of EDAs is performed in such a way that guarantees their shrinkage while maintaining their probabilistic dependence relationships learnt. The EDA process is embedded in an adapted recursive feature elimination procedure, thereby providing the genes that are best markers for the classification.|Results: The consistency with the literature and excellent classification performance achieved with our algorithm are illustrated on four microarray data sets: Breast, Colon, Leukemia and Prostate. Details on the last two data sets are available as supplementary material.|Conclusions: We have introduced a novel EDA-based logistic regression regularizer. It implicitly shrinks the coefficients during EDA evolution process while optimizing the usual likelihood function. The approach is combined with a gene subset selection procedure and automatically tunes the required parameters. Empirical results on microarray data sets provide sparse models with confirmed genes and performing better in classification than other competing regularized methods.",

In particular, both the density P-H(X) of high quality individuals and the density P-L(X) of low quality individuals are estimated; then the new population G is obtained with the following steps employed: 1) a new candidate individual x is reproduced through sampling from the density P-H(X); 2) to let P-H(X = x) and P-L(X = x) compare and the individual x will be stored into the new population G if and only if P-H(X = x) >= P-L(X = x); 3) the above steps repeat until M new individuals have been successfully generated where M is the population size.|To demonstrate the usefulness of low quality individuals for estimation of distribution algorithms, estimation of distribution algorithms using both high quality and low quality individuals are tested on several benchmark problems and their results are compared with those obtained by estimation of distribution algorithms where only high quality individuals are used. The usefulness of low quality individuals for speeding up the search of estimation of distribution algorithms is confirmed by the experimental results.",

        "description": "In this article, an efficient and novel approach for video data association is developed. This new method is formulated as a search across the hypotheses space defined by the possible association among tracks and detections, carried out for each frame of a video sequence. The full data association problem in visual tracking is formulated as a combinatorial hypotheses search with a heuristic evaluation function taking into account structural and specific information such as distance, shape, color, etc. To guarantee real-time performance, a time limit is set for the search process explore alternative solutions. This time limit defines the upper bound of the number of evaluations depending on search algorithm efficiency. Estimation distribution algorithms are proposed as an efficient evolutionary computation technique to search in this hypothesis space. Finally, an exhaustive comparison of the performance of alternative algorithms is carried out considering complex representative situations in real video sets. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

        "description": "The adoption of probabilistic models for selected individuals is a powerful approach for evolutionary computation. Probabilistic models based on high-order statistics have been used by estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), resulting better effectiveness when searching for global optima for hard optimization problems. This paper proposes a new framework for evolutionary algorithms, which combines a simple EDA based on order 1 statistics and a clustering technique in order to avoid the high computational cost required by higher order EDAs. The algorithm uses clustering to group genotypically similar solutions, relying that different clusters focus on different substructures and the combination of information from different clusters effectively combines substructures. The combination mechanism uses an information gain measure when deciding which cluster is more informative for any given gene position, during a pairwise cluster combination. Empirical evaluations effectively cover a comprehensive range of benchmark optimization problems.",

This algorithm is widely accepted and used in medicine for classification of diseases using DNA microarray data. Classical LR. does not perform well for microarrays when applied directly, because the number of variables exceeds the number of samples. However, by reducing the number of genes and selecting specific variables (using filtering methods) great results can be obtained with this algorithm. On this contribution we propose a novel approach for fitting the (penalized) LR. models based on EDAs. Breast Cancer dataset has been proposed to compare both accuracy and gene selection.",

        "description": "Distribution Estimation Using Markov network (DEUM) algorithm is a class of estimation of distribution algorithms that uses Markov networks to model and sample the distribution. Several different versions of this algorithm have been proposed and are shown to work well in a number of different optimisation problems. One of the key similarities between all of the DEUM algorithms proposed so far is that they all assume the interaction between variables in the problem to be pre given. In other words, they do not learn the structure of the problem and assume that it is known in advance. Therefore, they may not be classified as full estimation of distribution algorithms. This work presents a fully multivariate DEUM algorithm that can automatically learn the undirected structure of the problem, automatically find the cliques from the structure and automatically estimate a joint probability model of the Markov network. This model is then sampled using Monte Carlo samplers. The proposed DEUM algorithm can be applied to any general optimisation problem even when the structure is not known.",

This paper clearly establishes that QEA is an original algorithm that belongs to the class of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), while the common points and specifics of QEA compared to other EDAs are highlighted. The behavior of a versatile QEA relatively to three classical EDAs is extensively studied and comparatively good results are reported in terms of loss of diversity, scalability, solution quality, and robustness to fitness noise. To better understand QEA, two main advantages of the multimodel approach are analyzed in details. First, it is shown that QEA can dynamically adapt the learning speed leading to a smooth and robust convergence behavior. Second, we demonstrate that QEA manipulates more complex distributions of solutions than with a single model approach leading to more efficient optimization of problems with interacting variables.",

The DPSO-EDA incorporates the global statistical information collected front local best solution of all particles into the particle swarm optimization and therefore each particle has comprehensive learning and search ability. Further, constraint handling methods based on the split-and-merge local search is introduced to satisfy the constraints of the two types of problems. Simulation results on several benchmark problems show that the DPSO-EDA is better than previous methods such as genetic algorithm, tabu search, particle swarm optimization, and ant colony optimization.

A general and efficient face feature extraction approach is presented which utilizes linear discriminant information and global search strategy. In order to get rid of redundant information and meanwhile reduce computational burden, we first compute the nonzero feature space of scatter matrix of the training set, and then perform a global search on it to seek out the most valuable discriminant information of faces. Genetic algorithm is used for searching because of its well-known global search ability. Also, good classifiers are designed by using ensemble Artificial Neural Networks. Based on the individual classifiers, appropriate combinations are selected to construct the classification committee using EDAs(Estimation of Distribution Algorithms). Experiments are designed to test the performance of the feature extraction method and the classifiers separately. Results show that the proposed method produces good recognition rates on three benchmark databases.",

        "description": "The protein structure prediction (PSP) problem is one of the most important problems in computational biology. This paper proposes a novel Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) based method to solve the PSP problem on HP model. Firstly, a composite fitness function containing the information of folding structure core formation is introduced to replace the traditional fitness function of RP model. It can help to select more optimum individuals for probabilistic model of EDAs algorithm. And a set of guided operators are used to increase the diversity of population and the likelihood of escaping from local optima. Secondly, an improved backtracking repairing algorithm is proposed to repair invalid individuals sampled by the probabilistic model of EDAs for the long sequence protein instances. A detection procedure of feasibility is added to avoid entering invalid closed areas when selecting directions for the residues. Thus, it can significant reduce the number of backtracking operation and the computational cost for long sequence protein. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperform the basic EDAs method. At the same time, it is very competitive with the other existing algorithms for the PSP problem on lattice HP models.",

The paper introduces a new framework of iECOS called integrative probabilistic evolving spiking neural networks (ipSNN) that incorporate probability learning, parameters. ipSNN utilize a quantum inspired evolutionary optimization algorithm to optimize the probability parameters as these algorithms belong to the class of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDA). Both spikes and input features in ipESNN are represented as quantum bits being in a superposition of two states (I and 0) defined by a probability density function. This representation allows for the state of an entire ipESNN at any time to be represented probabilistically in a quantum bit register and probabilistically optimised until convergence using quantum gate operators and a fitness function. The proposed ipESNN is a promising framework for both engineering applications and brain data modeling as it offers faster and more efficient feature selection and model optimization in a large dimensional space in addition to revealing new knowledge that is not possible to obtain using other models. Further development of ipESNN are the neuro-genetic models - ipESNG, that are introduced too, along with open research questions.",

        "description": "Significant progress has been made in theory and design of Artificial Immune Systems (AISs) for solving hard problems accurately. However, an aspect not yet widely addressed by the research reported in the literature is the lack of ability of the AlSs to deal effectively with building blocks (partial high-quality solutions coded in the antibody). The available AlSs present mechanisms for evolving the population that do not take into account the relationship among the variables of the problem, potentially causing the disruption of high-quality partial solutions. This paper proposes a novel AIS with abilities to identify and properly manipulate building blocks in optimization problems. Instead of using cloning and mutation to generate new individuals, our algorithm builds a probabilistic model representing the joint probability distribution of the promising solutions and, subsequently, uses this model for sampling new solutions. The probabilistic model used is a Bayesian network due to its capability of properly capturing the most relevant interactions among the variables. Therefore, our algorithm, called Bayesian Artificial Immune System (BAIS), represents a significant attempt to improve the performance of immune-inspired algorithms when dealing with building blocks, and hence to solve efficiently hard optimization problems with complex interactions among the variables. The performance of BAIS compares favorably with that produced by contenders such as state-of-the-art Estimation of Distribution Algorithms. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

        "description": "Many real-world problems involve the coordination of multiple agents in dynamic environments, where characteristics of the problem being solved change over time. In such problems, adaptive, self-organizing agent approaches have been shown to provide very robust solutions. However, these approaches often require non-trivial amounts of time to respond to large environmental shifts. Considering this limitation, we observe that environmental changes in a given dynamic problem are generally not completely random; similar states in the environment tend to reappear over time. Memory is one way to leverage this past information and improve the adaptive efficiency of the agent system. In this paper, we explore the use of memory as a means of boosting the performance of self-organizing agents in solving dynamic coordination problems. We consider the specific problem of coordinating product flows in a factory that is subject to changing job mixes over time, which has been previously solved using a computational model of the task allocation behavior of wasps. We augment this base procedure with a number of memory systems, the most sophisticated of which exploit memory models inspired by estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) to manage computational cost. An experimental analysis is presented which demonstrates the advantage of using memory. Configurations using the EDA-inspired memory models are shown to substantially outperform configurations with more standard and infinite-sized memory models, and all are shown to improve the performance of the baseline task allocation procedure.",
