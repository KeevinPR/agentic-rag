        "description": "Due to the complicated circumstances in workshop, most of the conventional scheduling algorithms fail to meet the requirements of instantaneity, complexity, and dynamicity in job-shop scheduling problems. Compared with the static algorithms, dynamic scheduling algorithms can better fulfill the requirements in real situations. Considering that both flexibility and fuzzy processing time are common in reality, this paper focuses on the dynamic flexible job-shop scheduling problem with fuzzy processing time (DfFJSP). By adopting a series of transforming procedures, the original DfFJSP is simplified as a traditional static fuzzy flexible job-shop problem, which is more suitable to take advantage of the existing algorithms. In this paper, estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) is brought into address the post-transforming problem. An improved EDA is developed through making use of several elements omitted in original EDA, including the historical-optimal solution and the standardized solution vectors. The improved algorithm is named as fast estimation of distribution algorithm (fEDA) since it performs better in convergence speed and computation precision, compared with the original EDA. To sum up, the ingenious transformation and the effective fEDA algorithm provide an efficient and practical way to tackle the dynamic flexible fuzzy job-shop scheduling problem.

It has been proved to be NP complete, though. To solve this problem, researchers have provided many classic solutions. This paper proposes a new method of solving Steiner tree problem by using estimation of distribution algorithms (EDA). The basic idea is to initialize randomly n trees which contain the source node and the destination nodes. Some elites are selected by the selection operator. The algorithm then constructs a probabilistic model which attempts to estimate the probability distribution of the selected elites. Once the model is constructed, new trees are generated by sampling the distribution encoded by this model. These new trees are then incorporated back into the old population, possibly replacing it entirely. The process is repeated until some termination criteria are met. The algorithm constantly evolves trees to obtain a better solution tree with EDA ideas. This method leads to better performance, reduced time complexity, and optimized solution. Simulation results also show that the algorithm has better performance in searching and converging.",

        "description": "In this paper, we propose a multi-restart memetic algorithm framework for box constrained global continuous optimisation. In this framework, an evolutionary algorithm (EA) and a local optimizer are employed as separated building blocks. The EA is used to explore the search space for very promising solutions (e. g., solutions in the attraction basin of the global optimum) through its exploration capability and previous EA search history, and local search is used to improve these promising solutions to local optima. An estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) combined with a derivative free local optimizer, called NEWUOA (M. Powell, Developments of NEWUOA for minimization without derivatives. Journal of Numerical Analysis, 28:649-664, 2008), is developed based on this framework and empirically compared with several well-known EAs on a set of 40 commonly used test functions. The main components of the specific algorithm include: (1) an adaptive multivariate probability model, (2) a multiple sampling strategy, (3) decoupling of the hybridisation strategy, and (4) a restart mechanism. The adaptive multivariate probability model and multiple sampling strategy are designed to enhance the exploration capability. The restart mechanism attempts to make the search escape from local optima, resorting to previous search history. Comparison results show that the algorithm is comparable with the best known EAs, including the winner of the 2005 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC2005), and significantly better than the others in terms of both the solution quality and computational cost.",

        "description": "Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been widely proved to be effective in solving complex problems. Estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) is an emerging EA, which manipulates probability models instead of genes for evolution EDA creates probability models based on the promising solution in the population and generates offspring by sampling from these models. The model complexity is a key factor in the performance of EDA. Complex models can express the relations among variables more accurately than simple models. However, for some problems with strong interaction among variables, building a model for all the relations becomes unrealistic and impractical due to its high computational cost and requirement for a large population size. This study aims to understand the behaviors of EDAs with different model complexities in NK landscapes. Specifically, this study compares the solution quality and convergence speed of univariate marginal distribution algorithm (UMDA), bivariate marginal distribution algorithm (BMDA), and estimation of Bayesian network (EBNA) in the NK landscapes with different parameter settings. The comparative results reveal that high complexity does not imply high performance: Simple model such as UMDA and BMDA can outperform complex mode like EBNA on the tested NK landscape problems. The results also show that BMDA achieves a stable high probability of generating the best solution and satisfactory solution quality; by contrast, the probability for EBNA drastically declines after some generations.",

        "description": "Fragment assembly is a powerful method of protein structure prediction that builds protein models from a pool of candidate fragments taken from known structures. Stochastic sampling is subsequently used to refine the models. The structures are first represented as coarse-grained models and then as all-atom models for computational efficiency. Many models have to be generated independently due to the stochastic nature of the sampling methods used to search for the global minimum in a complex energy landscape. In this paper we present EdaFold(AA), a fragment-based approach which shares information between the generated models and steers the search towards native-like regions. A distribution over fragments is estimated from a pool of low energy all-atom models. This iteratively-refined distribution is used to guide the selection of fragments during the building of models for subsequent rounds of structure prediction. The use of an estimation of distribution algorithm enabled EdaFold(AA) to reach lower energy levels and to generate a higher percentage of near-native models. EdaFold(AA) uses an all-atom energy function and produces models with atomic resolution. We observed an improvement in energy-driven blind selection of models on a benchmark of 20 in comparison with the Rosetta AbInitioRelax protocol.",

        "description": "Due to the rapid increase in the usage and demand of wireless sensor networks (WSN), the limited frequency spectrum available for WSN applications will be extremely crowded in the near future. More sensor devices also mean more recharging/replacement of batteries, which will cause significant impact on the global carbon footprint. In this paper, we propose a relay-assisted cognitive radio sensor network (CRSN) that allocates communication resources in an environmentally friendly manner. We use shared band amplify and forward relaying for cooperative communication in the proposed CRSN. We present a multi-objective optimization architecture for resource allocation in a green cooperative cognitive radio sensor network (GC-CRSN). The proposed multi-objective framework jointly performs relay assignment and power allocation in GC-CRSN, while optimizing two conflicting objectives. The first objective is to maximize the total throughput, and the second objective is to minimize the total transmission power of CRSN. The proposed relay assignment and power allocation problem is a non-convex mixed-integer non-linear optimization problem (NC-MINLP), which is generally non-deterministic polynomial-time (NP)-hard. We introduce a hybrid heuristic algorithm for this problem. The hybrid heuristic includes an estimation-of-distribution algorithm (EDA) for performing power allocation and iterative greedy schemes for constraint satisfaction and relay assignment. We analyze the throughput and power consumption tradeoff in GC-CRSN. A detailed analysis of the performance of the proposed algorithm is presented with the simulation results.",

EDAhybrid's performance is tested in 15 benchmark problems of SRFLP and it successfully achieves optimum solution. Moreover, the mean error rates of EDAhybrid always get the lowest value compared to other algorithms.|SRFLP can be enhanced by considering more constraints, so it becomes enhanced SRFLP.

        "description": "The aim of the quay crane scheduling problem (QCSP) is to identify the best sequence of discharging and loading operations for a set of quay cranes. This problem is solved with a new hybrid estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA). The approach is proposed to tackle the drawbacks of the EDAs, i.e., the lack of diversity of solutions and poor ability of exploitation. The hybridization approach, used in this investigation, uses a distance based ranking model and the moth-flame algorithm. The distance based ranking model is in charge of modelling the solution space distribution, through an exponential function, by measuring the distance between solutions; meanwhile, the heuristic moth-flame determines who would be the offspring, with a spiral function that identifies the new locations for the new solutions. Based on the results, the proposed scheme, called QCEDA, works to enhance the performance of those other EDAs that use complex probability models. The dispersion results of the QCEDA scheme are less than the other algorithms used in the comparison section. This means that the solutions found by the QCEDA are more concentrated around the best value than other algorithms, i.e., the average of the solutions of the QCEDA converges better than other approaches to the best found value. Finally, as a conclusion, the hybrid EDAs have a better performance, or equal in effectiveness, than the so called pure EDAs.",

        "description": "Since estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) were proposed, many attempts have been made to improve EDAs' performance in the context of global optimization. So far, the studies or applications of multivariate probabilistic model-based EDAs in continuous domain are still mostly restricted to low-dimensional problems. Traditional EDAs have difficulties in solving higher dimensional problems because of the curse of dimensionality and rapidly increasing computational costs. However, scaling up continuous EDAs for large-scale optimization is still necessary, which is supported by the distinctive feature of EDAs: because a probabilistic model is explicitly estimated, from the learned model one can discover useful properties of the problem. Besides obtaining a good solution, understanding of the problem structure can be of great benefit, especially for black box optimization. We propose a novel EDA framework with model complexity control (EDA-MCC) to scale up continuous EDAs. By employing weakly dependent variable identification and subspace modeling, EDA-MCC shows significantly better performance than traditional EDAs on high-dimensional problems. Moreover, the computational cost and the requirement of large population sizes can be reduced in EDA-MCC. In addition to being able to find a good solution, EDA-MCC can also provide useful problem structure characterizations. EDA-MCC is the first successful instance of multivariate model-based EDAs that can be effectively applied to a general class of up to 500-D problems. It also outperforms some newly developed algorithms designed specifically for large-scale optimization. In order to understand the strengths and weaknesses of EDA-MCC, we have carried out extensive computational studies. Our results have revealed when EDA-MCC is likely to outperform others and on what kind of benchmark functions.",

In this research we present a classification scheme for these algorithms, based on ten characteristics: domain of the variables, relationships between the variables, probabilistic graphical model, estimation approach, restriction support, problem handling, sorting method, individuals' handling, selection approach, and replacement approach. These characteristics were extracted by analyzing all the 24 MOEDAs reported in the literature. The scheme presented here helps to identify the methods and techniques used in each algorithm, also, a useful method for the analysis of the optimization process of an EDA is proposed.

Several studies have demonstrated that the heuristic scheme of EDAs is effective and efficient for many optimization problems. Recently, it has been reported that the incorporation of mutation into EDAs increases the diversity of genetic information in the population, thereby avoiding premature convergence into a suboptimal solution. In this study, we propose a new mutation operator, a transpose mutation, designed for Bayesian structure learning. It enhances the diversity of the offspring and it increases the possibility of inferring the correct arc direction by considering the arc directions in candidate solutions as bi-directional, using the matrix transpose operator. As compared to the conventional EDAs, the transpose mutation-adopted EDAs are superior and effective algorithms for learning Bayesian networks.",

This paper introduces and evaluates a novel estimation of a distribution algorithm, called L1-regularized Bayesian optimization algorithm, L1BOA. In L1BOA, Bayesian networks as probabilistic models are learned in two steps. First, candidate parents of each variable in Bayesian networks are detected by means of L1-regularized logistic regression, with the aim of leading a sparse but nearly optimized network structure. Second, the greedy search, which is restricted to the candidate parent-child pairs, is deployed to identify the final structure. Compared with the Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA), L1BOA improves the efficiency of structure learning due to the reduction and automated control of network complexity introduced with L1-regularized learning. Experimental studies on different types of benchmark problems show that L1BOA not only outperforms BOA when no prior knowledge about problem structure is available, but also achieves and even exceeds the best performance of BOA that applies explicit controls on network complexity. Furthermore, Bayesian networks built by L1BOA and BOA during evolution are analysed and compared, which demonstrates that L1BOA is able to build simpler, yet more accurate probabilistic models.",

The core of EDAs is a probabilistic model which directly impacts performance of the algorithm. Previous EDAs have used a univariate, bi-variate, or multi-variable probabilistic model each time. However, application of only one probabilistic model may not represent the parental distribution well. This paper advocates the importance of using ensemble probabilistic models in EDAs. We combine the univariate probabilistic model with the bi-variate probabilistic model which learns different population characteristics. To explain how to employ the two probabilistic models, we proposed the Ensemble Self-Guided Genetic Algorithm (eSGGA). The extensive computation results on two NP-hard scheduling problems indicate the advantages of adopting two probabilistic models. Most important of all, eSGGA can avoid the computation effort overhead when compared with other EDAs employing two models. As a result, this paper might point out a next generation approach for EDAs.

        "description": "Understanding the relationship between a search algorithm and the space of problems is a fundamental issue in the optimization field. In this paper, we lay the foundations to elaborate taxonomies of problems under estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). By using an infinite population model and assuming that the selection operator is based on the rank of the solutions, we group optimization problems according to the behavior of the EDA. Throughout the definition of an equivalence relation between functions it is possible to partition the space of problems in equivalence classes in which the algorithm has the same behavior. We show that only the probabilistic model is able to generate different partitions of the set of possible problems and hence, it predetermines the number of different behaviors that the algorithm can exhibit. As a natural consequence of our definitions, all the objective functions are in the same equivalence class when the algorithm does not impose restrictions to the probabilistic model. The taxonomy of problems, which is also valid for finite populations, is studied in depth for a simple EDA that considers independence among the variables of the problem. We provide the sufficient and necessary condition to decide the equivalence between functions and then we develop the operators to describe and count the members of a class. In addition, we show the intrinsic relation between univariate EDAs and the neighborhood system induced by the Hamming distance by proving that all the functions in the same class have the same number of local optima and that they are in the same ranking positions. Finally, we carry out numerical simulations in order to analyze the different behaviors that the algorithm can exhibit for the functions defined over the search space {0, 1}(3).",

History matching is an example of an inverse problem, and there is significant active research on inverse problems in many other scientific and engineering areas. While many techniques from other fields, such as genetic algorithms, evolutionary strategies, differential evolution, particle swarm optimization, and the ensemble Kalman filter have been tried in the oil industry, more recent and effective ideas have yet to be tested. One of these relatively untested ideas is a class of algorithms known as estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). EDAs are population-based algorithms that use probability models to estimate the probability distribution of promising solutions, and then to generate new candidate solutions. EDAs have been shown to be very efficient in very complex high-dimensional problems.|An example of a state-of-the-art EDA is the Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA), which is a multivariate EDA employing Bayesian networks for modeling the relationships between good solutions. The use of a Bayesian network leads to relatively fast convergence as well as high diversity in the matched models. Given the relatively limited number of reservoir simulations used in history matching, EDA-BOA offers the promise of high-quality history matches with a fast convergence rate.|In this paper, we introduce EDAs and describe BOA in detail. We show results of the EDA-BOA algorithm on two history-matching problems. First, we tune the algorithm, demonstrate convergence speed, and search diversity on the PUNQ-S3 synthetic case. Second, we apply the algorithm to a real North Sea turbidite field with multiple wells. In both examples, we show improvements in performance over traditional population-based algorithms.",

Compared to Michigan-style GBML, Pittsburgh-style GBML is expected to achieve more compact solutions. It has been shown that standard recombination operators in EAs do not assure an effective evolutionary search to solve sophisticated problems that contain strong interactions between features. On the other hand, when dealing with real-world classification tasks, irrelevant features not only complicate the problem but also incur unnecessary matchings in GBML systems, which increase the computational cost a lot. To handle the two problems mentioned above in an integrated manner, a new Pittsburgh-style GBML system is proposed. In the proposed method, classifiers are generated and recombined at two levels. At the high level, classifiers are recombined by rule-wise uniform crossover operators since each classifier consists of a variable-size rule set. At the low level, single rules contained in classifiers are reproduced via sampling Bayesian networks that characterize the global statistical information extracted from promising rules found so far. Furthermore, according to the statistical information in the rule population, an embedded approach is presented to detect and remove redundant features incrementally following the evolution of rule population. Results of empirical evaluation show that the proposed method outperforms the original Pittsburgh-style GBML system in terms of classification accuracy while reducing the computational cost. Furthermore, the proposed method is also competitive to other non-evolutionary, highly used machine learning methods. With respect to the performance of feature reduction, the proposed embedded approach is able to deliver solutions with higher classification accuracy when removing the same number of features as other feature reduction techniques do.

        "description": "Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDA) are a major branch of evolutionary algorithms (EA) with some unique advantages in principle. They are able to take advantage of correlation structure to drive the search more efficiently, and they are able to provide insights about the structure of the search space. However, model building in high dimensions is extremely challenging and as a result existing EDAs lose their strengths in large scale problems.|Large scale continuous global optimisation is key to many real-world problems of modern days. Scaling up EAs to large scale problems has become one of the biggest challenges of the field.|This paper pins down some fundamental roots of the problem and makes a start at developing a new and generic framework to yield effective EDA-type algorithms for large scale continuous global optimisation problems. Our concept is to introduce an ensemble of random projections of the set of fittest search points to low dimensions as a basis for developing a new and generic divide-and-conquer methodology. This is rooted in the theory of random projections developed in theoretical computer science, and will exploit recent advances of non-asymptotic random matrix theory.",

        "description": "Classical estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) generally use truncation selection to estimate the distribution of the good individuals while ignoring the bad ones. However, various researches in evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have reported that the bad individuals may affect and help solving the problem. This paper proposes a new method to use the bad individuals by studying the substructures rather than the entire individual structures to solve reinforcement learning (RL) problems, which generally factorize their entire solutions to the sequences of state-action pairs. This work was studied in a recent graph-based EDA named probabilistic model building genetic network programming (PMBGNP), which could solve RL problems successfully, to propose an extended PMBGNP. The effectiveness of this work is verified in an RL problem, namely robot control. Compared to other related work, results show that the proposed method can significantly speed up the evolution efficiency. (c) 2013 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

        "authors": "Martinez, EEH, Pe\u00f1a, SIV and Soto, ES",
        "description": "In robotics, solving the direct kinematics problem (DKP) for parallel robots is very often more difficult and time consuming than for their serial counterparts. The problem is stated as follows: given the joint variables, the Cartesian variables should be computed, namely the pose of the mobile platform. Most of the time, the DKP requires solving a non-linear system of equations. In addition, given that the system could be non-convex, Newton or Quasi-Newton (Dogleg) based solvers get trapped on local minima. The capacity of such kinds of solvers to find an adequate solution strongly depends on the starting point. A well-known problem is the selection of such a starting point, which requires a priori information about the neighbouring region of the solution. In order to circumvent this issue, this article proposes an efficient method to select and to generate the starting point based on probabilistic learning. Experiments and discussion are presented to show the method performance. The method successfully avoids getting trapped on local minima without the need for human intervention, which increases its robustness when compared with a single Dogleg approach. This proposal can be extended to other structures, to any non-linear system of equations, and of course, to non-linear optimization problems.",

        "authors": "Gwak, J and Sim, KM",
        "description": "In agent-mediated negotiation systems, the majority of the research focused on finding negotiation strategies for optimizing price only. However, in negotiation systems with time constraints (e.g., resource negotiations for Grid and Cloud computing), it is crucial to optimize either or both price and negotiation speed based on preferences of participants for improving efficiency and increasing utilization. To this end, this work presents the design and implementation of negotiation agents that can optimize both price and negotiation speed (for the given preference settings of these parameters) under a negotiation setting of complete information. Then, to support negotiations with incomplete information, this work deals with the problem of finding effective negotiation strategies of agents by using coevolutionary learning, which results in optimal negotiation outcomes. In the coevolutionary learning method used here, two types of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) such as conventional EDAs (S-EDAs) and novel improved dynamic diversity controlling EDAs ((IDC)-C-2-EDAs) were adopted for comparative studies. A series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance for coevolving effective negotiation strategies using the EDAs. In the experiments, each agent adopts three representative preference criteria: (1) placing more emphasis on optimizing more price, (2) placing equal emphasis on optimizing exact price and speed and (3) placing more emphasis on optimizing more speed. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the coevolutionary learning adopting (IDC)-C-2-EDAs because it generally coevolved effective converged negotiation strategies (close to the optimum) while the coevolutionary learning adopting S-EDAs often failed to coevolve such strategies within a reasonable number of generations.",

Since NVIDIA released the compute unified device architecture (CUDA), graphic processing units have enabled lots of scalable parallel programs in a wide range of fields. However, parallelization of model building for EDAs is rarely studied. In this paper, we propose two implementations on CUDA to speed up the model building in the extended compact genetic algorithm (ECGA). The first implementation is algorithmically identical to original ECGA. Aiming at a greater speed boost, the second implementation modifies the model building. It slightly decreases the accuracy of models in exchange for more speedup. Empirically, the first implementation achieves a speedup of roughly 359 to the baseline on 500-bit trap problem with order 5, and the second implementation achieves a speedup of roughly 506 to the baseline on the same problem. Finally, both of our implementations scale up to 9,800-bit trap problem with order 5 on one single Tesla C2050 GPU card.",

A major problem of protein datasets that increase the complexity of classification models is their large number of features. The process of drug discovery often involves the use of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to identify chemical structures that could have good inhibitory effects on specific targets and have low toxicity (non-specific activity). QSAR models are regression or classification models used in the chemical and biological sciences. Because of high dimensionality problems, a feature selection problem is imminent. In this study, we thus employ a hybrid Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) based filter-wrapper methodology to simultaneously extract informative feature subsets and build robust QSAR models. The performance of the algorithm was tested on the benchmark classification challenge datasets obtained from the CoePRa competition platform, developed in 2006. Our results clearly demonstrate the efficacy of a hybrid EDA filter-wrapper algorithm in comparison to the results reported earlier.",

        "description": "Objective: Is it possible to predict the severity staging of a Parkinson's disease (PD) patient using scores of non-motor symptoms? This is the kickoff question for a machine learning approach to classify two widely known PD severity indexes using individual tests from a broad set of non-motor PD clinical scales only.|Methods: The Hoehn & Yahr index and clinical impression of severity index are global measures of PD severity. They constitute the labels to be assigned in two supervised classification problems using only non-motor symptom tests as predictor variables. Such predictors come from a wide range of PD symptoms, such as cognitive impairment, psychiatric complications, autonomic dysfunction or sleep disturbance. The classification was coupled with a feature subset selection task using an advanced evolutionary algorithm, namely an estimation of distribution algorithm.|Results: Results show how five different classification paradigms using a wrapper feature selection scheme are capable of predicting each of the class variables with estimated accuracy in the range of 72-92%. In addition, classification into the main three severity categories (Mild, moderate and severe) was split into dichotomic problems where binary classifiers perform better and select different subsets of non-motor symptoms. The number of jointly selected symptoms throughout the whole process was low, suggesting a link between the selected non-motor symptoms and the general severity of the disease.|Conclusion: Quantitative results are discussed from a medical point of view, reflecting a clear translation to the clinical manifestations of PD. Moreover, results include a brief panel of non-motor symptoms that could help clinical practitioners to identify patients who are at different stages of the disease from a limited set of symptoms, such as hallucinations, fainting, inability to control body sphincters or believing in unlikely facts.

        "description": "In this paper, we present an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) augmented with enhanced dynamic diversity controlling and local improvement methods to solve competitive coevolution problems for agent-based automated negotiations. Since optimal negotiation strategies ensure that interacting agents negotiate optimally, finding such strategies-particularly, for the agents having incomplete information about their opponents-is an important and challenging issue to support agent-based automated negotiation systems. To address this issue, we consider the problem of finding optimal negotiation strategies for a bilateral negotiation between self-interested agents with incomplete information through an EDA-based coevolution mechanism. Due to the competitive nature of the agents, EDAs should be able to deal with competitive coevolution based on two asymmetric populations each consisting of self-interested agents. However, finding optimal negotiation solutions via coevolutionary learning using conventional EDAs is difficult because the EDAs suffer from premature convergence and their search capability deteriorates during coevolution. To solve these problems, even though we have previously devised the dynamic diversity controlling EDA ((DC)-C-2-EDA), which is mainly characterized by a diversification and refinement (DR) procedure, (DC)-C-2-EDA suffers from the population reinitialization problem that leads to a computational overhead. To reduce the computational overhead and to achieve further improvements in terms of solution accuracy, we have devised an improved (DC)-C-2-EDA ((IDC)-C-2-EDA) by adopting an enhanced DR procedure and a local neighborhood search (LNS) method. Favorable empirical results support the effectiveness of the proposed (IDC)-C-2-EDA compared to conventional and the other proposed EDAs. Furthermore, (IDC)-C-2-EDA finds solutions very close to the optimum.",

AMaLGaM is benchmarked within the 2009 black box optimization benchmarking (BBOB) framework and compared to a variant with incremental model building (iAMaLGaM). We study the implications of factorizing the covariance matrix in the Gaussian distribution, to use only a few or no covariances. Further, AMaLGaM and iAMaLGaM are also evaluated on the noisy BBOB problems and we assess how well multiple evaluations per solution can average out noise. Experimental evidence suggests that parameter-free AMaLGaM can solve a wide range of problems efficiently with perceived polynomial scalability, including multimodal problems, obtaining the best or near-best results among all algorithms tested in 2009 on functions such as the step-ellipsoid and Katsuuras, but failing to locate the optimum within the time limit on skew Rastrigin-Bueche separable and Lunacek bi-Rastrigin in higher dimensions. AMaLGaM is found to be more robust to noise than iAMaLGaM due to the larger required population size. Using few or no covariances hinders the EDA from dealing with rotations of the search space. Finally, the use of noise averaging is found to be less efficient than the direct application of the EDA unless the noise is uniformly distributed. AMaLGaM was among the best performing algorithms submitted to the BBOB workshop in 2009.",

Recently, some progress has been made in this area by introducing probability models on rankings to optimize permutation domain problems. In particular, the Mallows model and the Generalized Mallows model demonstrated their effectiveness when used with estimation of distribution algorithms. Motivated by these advances, in this paper we introduce a Thurstone order statistics model, called Plackett-Luce, to the framework of estimation of distribution algorithms. In order to prove the potential of the proposed algorithm, we consider two different permutation problems: the linear ordering problem and the flowshop scheduling problem. In addition, the results are compared with those obtained by the Mallows and the Generalized Mallows proposals. Conducted experiments demonstrate that the Plackett-Luce model is the best performing model for solving the linear ordering problem. However, according to the experimental results, the Generalized Mallows model turns out to be very robust obtaining very competitive results for both problems, especially for the permutation flowshop scheduling problem.",

Problems requiring deep dependence in their probability structure see such rapid stochastic drift that the usual methods for controlling drift are unable to compensate.

This paper utilizes building-block-wise distances to define a new distance metric, the one-niche distance. For those EDAs which provide explicit linkage information, the one-niche distances can be directly incorporated into RTR. For EDAs without such information, DSMRTR constructs a dependency structure matrix via the differential mutual complement to estimate the one-niche distances. Empirical results show that DSMRTR induces fewer spurious dependencies than RTR does while maintaining enough diversity for EDAs.",

The proposed CGEDA needs no initialization of parameters; mean and standard deviation of solution is extracted from population information during optimization processing adaptively. Gaussian Data distribution and dependent Individuals are two assumptions that are considered in CGEDA. The fitting task model in CGEDA is based on maximum likelihood procedure to estimate parameters of assumed Gaussian distribution for data distribution. The proposed algorithm is evaluated and compared experimentally with Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm (UMDA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Cellular Probabilistic Optimization Algorithm (CPOA). Experimental results show superior performance of CGEDA V.S. the other algorithms.",

        "description": "It is a known issue that Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) tend to converge prematurely. There exist various articles which report that they are incapable of determining the adequate variance, getting trapped even in regions which does not contain any global neither local minimum. In this vein, several proposals intend to insert and to preserve diversity. The proposal range is from modifying the probability distribution by inserting artificial variance, to mutating individuals or the search distribution. This work presents a novel selection method which is used to estimate a weighted covariance matrix equipped with adequate magnitude and directions. The covariance matrix is directly related with the information acquired from the current population, hence no artificial artifacts are inserted. By comparing with state of the art EDAs using test problems and graphical and statistical measures, we evidence that our proposal avoids premature convergence, and solves difficult problems -in the sense of variance preservation-, without the need of complex models, mutation, or explicit variance scaling.",

        "description": "The unimodal Gaussian has been the distribution of choice for many extensions in Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDA). Some groups have used clustering algorithms, like k-means, to use multimodal distributions in different modifications of EDA. Most proposals use a fixed number of groups or clusters, and other works use heuristic approaches to find the right number of clusters in the search space without any previous information. The heuristic methods, however, lack the mathematical rigor required in the inference of a probability distribution's parameters. In this work, we propose the use of the Nonparametric Bayesian Model known as Dirichlet Process to fit the number of clusters given the data in a modified Population Based Incremental Learning (PBIL) model. We compare our approach with similar techniques that also use multimodal probability distributions to enhance the quality of the search in other EDA approaches. Our approach shows improvements by reducing the number of generations needed to find good results that are comparable to the state of the art in clustered EDA.",

In this paper, the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is modeled as a novel EDA in the context of multi-objective optimization. RBM is an energy-based stochastic neural network. The probabilities of the joint configuration over the visible and hidden units in the network are trained using contrastive divergence until the distribution over the global state reaches a certain level of thermal equilibrium. Subsequently, the probabilistic model is constructed using the energy function of the network. In addition, clustering in the phenotypic space is incorporated into the proposed algorithm. The effects on clustering and the stability of the trained network on optimization performance are rigorously examined. Experimental studies are conducted to analyze the performance of the proposed algorithm in scalable problems with large number of objective functions and decision variables. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Each role is associated to specific tasks in the optimization process and employs different estimation of distribution methods. By combining estimation of distribution, clusterization of the objective domain, and the crowding distance assignment of NSGA-II, it was possible to extract more information about the optimization problem, thus enabling an efficient solution of large scale decision variable problems. Regarding the test problems, quality indicators, and GDE3, MOEA/D and NSGA-II methods, the combination of strategies incorporated into the MOEDABC algorithm has presented competitive results, which indicate this method as a useful optimization tool for the class of problems considered.",

In recent years, a large literature has evolved on the use of evolutionary artificial neural networks (EANN) in many forecasting applications. Evolving neural networks are particularly appealing because of their ability to model an unspecified nonlinear relationship between time series variables. In this work, two new approaches of a previous system, automatic design of artificial neural networks (ADANN) applied to forecast time series, are tackled. In ADANN, the automatic process to design artificial neural networks was carried out by a genetic algorithm (GA). This paper evaluates three methods to evolve neural networks architectures, one carried out with genetic algorithm, a second one carried out with differential evolution algorithm (DE) and the last one using estimation of distribution algorithms (EDA). A comparative study among these three methods with a set of referenced time series will be shown. In this paper, we also compare ADANN forecasting ability against a forecasting tool called Forecast Pro(A (R)) (FP) software, using five benchmark time series. The object of this study is to try to improve the final forecasting getting an accurate system.",

        "description": "Variable interdependency, referred to as linkage in genetic algorithms (GAs), has been among the most useful information in evolutionary optimisation. With the aid of linkage information, efficient evolution can be attained by GAs. Among variants of advanced GAs, linkages are either explicitly identified, as in perturbation-based methods, or implicitly extracted, as in estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). As linkage discovery can be considered a matter of information extraction, Shannon's entropy, a renowned metric, has been widely adopted in modern GAs. Despite the validation of theoretical bounds, which is not algorithm-specific, on evaluation complexity of linkage problems, a representative population sizing model for discrete EDAs has been developed based on the distribution of entropy measurement. On the other hand, though entropy metrics have been adopted in recent perturbation-based methods, relevant complexity analysis on these methods is still absent. In this article, we propose a population sizing model for a recently developed linkage identification method, called inductive linkage identification (ILI). The proposed model takes the entropy-based classification algorithm into account and is capable of providing an accurate estimation of population requirement. The adopted modelling approach is different than that for discrete EDAs and may give researchers insights into entropy-based linkage discovery approaches.",

        "description": "Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) identify linkages among genes and build models which decompose a given problem. EDAs have been successfully applied to many real-world problems; however, whether their models indicate the optimal way to decompose the given problem is rarely studied. This paper proposes using the number of function evaluations (N-fe) as the performance measure of EDA models. As a result, the optimal model can be defined as the one that consumes the fewest N-fe on average for EDAs to solve a specific problem. Based on this concept, correct building blocks (BBs) can be defined as groups of genes that construct the optimal model. Similarly, linkages within a BB are defined as the correct linkages of which the specific problem consists. The capabilities of four commonly used linkage-learning metrics, nonlinearity, entropy, simultaneity and differential mutual complement, are investigated based on the above definitions. For certain partially separable problems, none of the above metrics yields difference that is statistically significant between linear and nonlinear gene pairs. Although an optimal threshold still exists to separate linear and nonlinear gene pairs, most existing EDA designs today have not yet characterize such threshold. Based on the idea of N-fe estimation, this paper also proposes a metric enhancer, named eNFE, to enhance existing linkage-learning techniques. Empirical results show that eNFE improves BB identification by eliminating spurious linkages which occur often in most existing EDAs. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

        "description": "Background: One of the emerging techniques for performing the analysis of the DNA microarray data known as biclustering is the search of subsets of genes and conditions which are coherently expressed. These subgroups provide clues about the main biological processes. Until now, different approaches to this problem have been proposed. Most of them use the mean squared residue as quality measure but relevant and interesting patterns can not be detected such as shifting, or scaling patterns. Furthermore, recent papers show that there exist new coherence patterns involved in different kinds of cancer and tumors such as inverse relationships between genes which can not be captured.|Results: The proposed measure is called Spearman's biclustering measure (SBM) which performs an estimation of the quality of a bicluster based on the non-linear correlation among genes and conditions simultaneously. The search of biclusters is performed by using a evolutionary technique called estimation of distribution algorithms which uses the SBM measure as fitness function. This approach has been examined from different points of view by using artificial and real microarrays. The assessment process has involved the use of quality indexes, a set of bicluster patterns of reference including new patterns and a set of statistical tests. It has been also examined the performance using real microarrays and comparing to different algorithmic approaches such as Bimax, CC, OPSM, Plaid and xMotifs. Conclusions: SBM shows several advantages such as the ability to recognize more complex coherence patterns such as shifting, scaling and inversion and the capability to selectively marginalize genes and conditions depending on the statistical significance.

In this study, we propose a new mutation operator, a transpose mutation, designed for Bayesian structure learning. It enhances the diversity of the offspring and it increases the possibility of inferring the correct arc direction by considering the arc directions in candidate solutions as bi-directional, using the matrix transpose operator.

This paper introduces and evaluates a novel estimation of a distribution algorithm, called L1-regularized Bayesian optimization algorithm, L1BOA. In L1BOA, Bayesian networks as probabilistic models are learned in two steps. First, candidate parents of each variable in Bayesian networks are detected by means of L1-regularized logistic regression, with the aim of leading a sparse but nearly optimized network structure. Second, the greedy search, which is restricted to the candidate parent-child pairs, is deployed to identify the final structure. Compared with the Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA), L1BOA improves the efficiency of structure learning due to the reduction and automated control of network complexity introduced with L1-regularized learning. Experimental studies on different types of benchmark problems show that L1BOA not only outperforms BOA when no prior knowledge about problem structure is available, but also achieves and even exceeds the best performance of BOA that applies explicit controls on network complexity. Furthermore, Bayesian networks built by L1BOA and BOA during evolution are analysed and compared, which demonstrates that L1BOA is able to build simpler, yet more accurate probabilistic models.",

The core of EDAs is a probabilistic model which directly impacts performance of the algorithm. Previous EDAs have used a univariate, bi-variate, or multi-variable probabilistic model each time. However, application of only one probabilistic model may not represent the parental distribution well. This paper advocates the importance of using ensemble probabilistic models in EDAs. We combine the univariate probabilistic model with the bi-variate probabilistic model which learns different population characteristics. To explain how to employ the two probabilistic models, we proposed the Ensemble Self-Guided Genetic Algorithm (eSGGA). The extensive computation results on two NP-hard scheduling problems indicate the advantages of adopting two probabilistic models. Most important of all, eSGGA can avoid the computation effort overhead when compared with other EDAs employing two models. As a result, this paper might point out a next generation approach for EDAs.

        "description": "Understanding the relationship between a search algorithm and the space of problems is a fundamental issue in the optimization field. In this paper, we lay the foundations to elaborate taxonomies of problems under estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). By using an infinite population model and assuming that the selection operator is based on the rank of the solutions, we group optimization problems according to the behavior of the EDA. Throughout the definition of an equivalence relation between functions it is possible to partition the space of problems in equivalence classes in which the algorithm has the same behavior. We show that only the probabilistic model is able to generate different partitions of the set of possible problems and hence, it predetermines the number of different behaviors that the algorithm can exhibit. As a natural consequence of our definitions, all the objective functions are in the same equivalence class when the algorithm does not impose restrictions to the probabilistic model. The taxonomy of problems, which is also valid for finite populations, is studied in depth for a simple EDA that considers independence among the variables of the problem. We provide the sufficient and necessary condition to decide the equivalence between functions and then we develop the operators to describe and count the members of a class. In addition, we show the intrinsic relation between univariate EDAs and the neighborhood system induced by the Hamming distance by proving that all the functions in the same class have the same number of local optima and that they are in the same ranking positions. Finally, we carry out numerical simulations in order to analyze the different behaviors that the algorithm can exhibit for the functions defined over the search space {0, 1}(3).",

History matching is an example of an inverse problem, and there is significant active research on inverse problems in many other scientific and engineering areas. While many techniques from other fields, such as genetic algorithms, evolutionary strategies, differential evolution, particle swarm optimization, and the ensemble Kalman filter have been tried in the oil industry, more recent and effective ideas have yet to be tested. One of these relatively untested ideas is a class of algorithms known as estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). EDAs are population-based algorithms that use probability models to estimate the probability distribution of promising solutions, and then to generate new candidate solutions. EDAs have been shown to be very efficient in very complex high-dimensional problems.|An example of a state-of-the-art EDA is the Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA), which is a multivariate EDA employing Bayesian networks for modeling the relationships between good solutions. The use of a Bayesian network leads to relatively fast convergence as well as high diversity in the matched models. Given the relatively limited number of reservoir simulations used in history matching, EDA-BOA offers the promise of high-quality history matches with a fast convergence rate.|In this paper, we introduce EDAs and describe BOA in detail. We show results of the EDA-BOA algorithm on two history-matching problems. First, we tune the algorithm, demonstrate convergence speed, and search diversity on the PUNQ-S3 synthetic case.

        "description": "Genetic-based machine learning (GBML) systems, which employ evolutionary algorithms (EAs) as search mechanisms, evolve rule-based classification models to represent target concepts. Compared to Michigan-style GBML, Pittsburgh-style GBML is expected to achieve more compact solutions. It has been shown that standard recombination operators in EAs do not assure an effective evolutionary search to solve sophisticated problems that contain strong interactions between features. On the other hand, when dealing with real-world classification tasks, irrelevant features not only complicate the problem but also incur unnecessary matchings in GBML systems, which increase the computational cost a lot. To handle the two problems mentioned above in an integrated manner, a new Pittsburgh-style GBML system is proposed. In the proposed method, classifiers are generated and recombined at two levels. At the high level, classifiers are recombined by rule-wise uniform crossover operators since each classifier consists of a variable-size rule set. At the low level, single rules contained in classifiers are reproduced via sampling Bayesian networks that characterize the global statistical information extracted from promising rules found so far. Furthermore, according to the statistical information in the rule population, an embedded approach is presented to detect and remove redundant features incrementally following the evolution of rule population. Results of empirical evaluation show that the proposed method outperforms the original Pittsburgh-style GBML system in terms of classification accuracy while reducing the computational cost. Furthermore, the proposed method is also competitive to other non-evolutionary, highly used machine learning methods. With respect to the performance of feature reduction, the proposed embedded approach is able to deliver solutions with higher classification accuracy when removing the same number of features as other feature reduction techniques do.

On estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), hill climbing strengthens the signals of dependencies on correlated variables and improves the quality of model building, which reduces the required population size and convergence time. However, hill climbing also consumes extra computational time. In this paper, analytical models are developed to investigate the effects of combining two different hill climbers with the extended compact genetic algorithm and the dependency structure matrix genetic algorithm. By using the one-max problem and the 5-bit non-overlapping trap problem as the test problems, the performances of different hill climbers are compared.

However, model building in high dimensions is extremely challenging and as a result existing EDAs lose their strengths in large scale problems.|Large scale continuous global optimisation is key to many real-world problems of modern days. Scaling up EAs to large scale problems has become one of the biggest challenges of the field.|This paper pins down some fundamental roots of the problem and makes a start at developing a new and generic framework to yield effective EDA-type algorithms for large scale continuous global optimisation problems. Our concept is to introduce an ensemble of random projections of the set of fittest search points to low dimensions as a basis for developing a new and generic divide-and-conquer methodology. This is rooted in the theory of random projections developed in theoretical computer science, and will exploit recent advances of non-asymptotic random matrix theory.",

        "description": "In robotics, solving the direct kinematics problem (DKP) for parallel robots is very often more difficult and time consuming than for their serial counterparts. The problem is stated as follows: given the joint variables, the Cartesian variables should be computed, namely the pose of the mobile platform. Most of the time, the DKP requires solving a non-linear system of equations. In addition, given that the system could be non-convex, Newton or Quasi-Newton (Dogleg) based solvers get trapped on local minima. The capacity of such kinds of solvers to find an adequate solution strongly depends on the starting point. A well-known problem is the selection of such a starting point, which requires a priori information about the neighbouring region of the solution. In order to circumvent this issue, this article proposes an efficient method to select and to generate the starting point based on probabilistic learning. Experiments and discussion are presented to show the method performance. The method successfully avoids getting trapped on local minima without the need for human intervention, which increases its robustness when compared with a single Dogleg approach. This proposal can be extended to other structures, to any non-linear system of equations, and of course, to non-linear optimization problems.",

        "description": "In agent-mediated negotiation systems, the majority of the research focused on finding negotiation strategies for optimizing price only. However, in negotiation systems with time constraints (e.g., resource negotiations for Grid and Cloud computing), it is crucial to optimize either or both price and negotiation speed based on preferences of participants for improving efficiency and increasing utilization. To this end, this work presents the design and implementation of negotiation agents that can optimize both price and negotiation speed (for the given preference settings of these parameters) under a negotiation setting of complete information. Then, to support negotiations with incomplete information, this work deals with the problem of finding effective negotiation strategies of agents by using coevolutionary learning, which results in optimal negotiation outcomes. In the coevolutionary learning method used here, two types of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) such as conventional EDAs (S-EDAs) and novel improved dynamic diversity controlling EDAs ((IDC)-C-2-EDAs) were adopted for comparative studies. A series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance for coevolving effective negotiation strategies using the EDAs. In the experiments, each agent adopts three representative preference criteria: (1) placing more emphasis on optimizing more price, (2) placing equal emphasis on optimizing exact price and speed and (3) placing more emphasis on optimizing more speed. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the coevolutionary learning adopting (IDC)-C-2-EDAs because it generally coevolved effective converged negotiation strategies (close to the optimum) while the coevolutionary learning adopting S-EDAs often failed to coevolve such strategies within a reasonable number of generations.",

In this paper, we propose two implementations on CUDA to speed up the model building in the extended compact genetic algorithm (ECGA). The first implementation is algorithmically identical to original ECGA. Aiming at a greater speed boost, the second implementation modifies the model building. It slightly decreases the accuracy of models in exchange for more speedup. Empirically, the first implementation achieves a speedup of roughly 359 to the baseline on 500-bit trap problem with order 5, and the second implementation achieves a speedup of roughly 506 to the baseline on the same problem.

This is the kickoff question for a machine learning approach to classify two widely known PD severity indexes using individual tests from a broad set of non-motor PD clinical scales only.|Methods: The Hoehn & Yahr index and clinical impression of severity index are global measures of PD severity. They constitute the labels to be assigned in two supervised classification problems using only non-motor symptom tests as predictor variables. Such predictors come from a wide range of PD symptoms, such as cognitive impairment, psychiatric complications, autonomic dysfunction or sleep disturbance. The classification was coupled with a feature subset selection task using an advanced evolutionary algorithm, namely an estimation of distribution algorithm.|Results: Results show how five different classification paradigms using a wrapper feature selection scheme are capable of predicting each of the class variables with estimated accuracy in the range of 72-92%. In addition, classification into the main three severity categories (Mild, moderate and severe) was split into dichotomic problems where binary classifiers perform better and select different subsets of non-motor symptoms. The number of jointly selected symptoms throughout the whole process was low, suggesting a link between the selected non-motor symptoms and the general severity of the disease.|Conclusion: Quantitative results are discussed from a medical point of view, reflecting a clear translation to the clinical manifestations of PD. Moreover, results include a brief panel of non-motor symptoms that could help clinical practitioners to identify patients who are at different stages of the disease from a limited set of symptoms, such as hallucinations, fainting, inability to control body sphincters or believing in unlikely facts.

        "description": "In this paper, we present an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) augmented with enhanced dynamic diversity controlling and local improvement methods to solve competitive coevolution problems for agent-based automated negotiations. Since optimal negotiation strategies ensure that interacting agents negotiate optimally, finding such strategies-particularly, for the agents having incomplete information about their opponents-is an important and challenging issue to support agent-based automated negotiation systems. To address this issue, we consider the problem of finding optimal negotiation strategies for a bilateral negotiation between self-interested agents with incomplete information through an EDA-based coevolution mechanism. Due to the competitive nature of the agents, EDAs should be able to deal with competitive coevolution based on two asymmetric populations each consisting of self-interested agents. However, finding optimal negotiation solutions via coevolutionary learning using conventional EDAs is difficult because the EDAs suffer from premature convergence and their search capability deteriorates during coevolution. To solve these problems, even though we have previously devised the dynamic diversity controlling EDA ((DC)-C-2-EDA), which is mainly characterized by a diversification and refinement (DR) procedure, (DC)-C-2-EDA suffers from the population reinitialization problem that leads to a computational overhead. To reduce the computational overhead and to achieve further improvements in terms of solution accuracy, we have devised an improved (DC)-C-2-EDA ((IDC)-C-2-EDA) by adopting an enhanced DR procedure and a local neighborhood search (LNS) method. Favorable empirical results support the effectiveness of the proposed (IDC)-C-2-EDA compared to conventional and the other proposed EDAs. Furthermore, (IDC)-C-2-EDA finds solutions very close to the optimum.",

AMaLGaM is benchmarked within the 2009 black box optimization benchmarking (BBOB) framework and compared to a variant with incremental model building (iAMaLGaM). We study the implications of factorizing the covariance matrix in the Gaussian distribution, to use only a few or no covariances. Further, AMaLGaM and iAMaLGaM are also evaluated on the noisy BBOB problems and we assess how well multiple evaluations per solution can average out noise. Experimental evidence suggests that parameter-free AMaLGaM can solve a wide range of problems efficiently with perceived polynomial scalability, including multimodal problems, obtaining the best or near-best results among all algorithms tested in 2009 on functions such as the step-ellipsoid and Katsuuras, but failing to locate the optimum within the time limit on skew Rastrigin-Bueche separable and Lunacek bi-Rastrigin in higher dimensions. AMaLGaM is found to be more robust to noise than iAMaLGaM due to the larger required population size. Using few or no covariances hinders the EDA from dealing with rotations of the search space. Finally, the use of noise averaging is found to be less efficient than the direct application of the EDA unless the noise is uniformly distributed. AMaLGaM was among the best performing algorithms submitted to the BBOB workshop in 2009.",

In particular, the Mallows model and the Generalized Mallows model demonstrated their effectiveness when used with estimation of distribution algorithms. Motivated by these advances, in this paper we introduce a Thurstone order statistics model, called Plackett-Luce, to the framework of estimation of distribution algorithms. In order to prove the potential of the proposed algorithm, we consider two different permutation problems: the linear ordering problem and the flowshop scheduling problem. In addition, the results are compared with those obtained by the Mallows and the Generalized Mallows proposals. Conducted experiments demonstrate that the Plackett-Luce model is the best performing model for solving the linear ordering problem. However, according to the experimental results, the Generalized Mallows model turns out to be very robust obtaining very competitive results for both problems, especially for the permutation flowshop scheduling problem.",

Problems requiring deep dependence in their probability structure see such rapid stochastic drift that the usual methods for controlling drift are unable to compensate.

This paper utilizes building-block-wise distances to define a new distance metric, the one-niche distance. For those EDAs which provide explicit linkage information, the one-niche distances can be directly incorporated into RTR. For EDAs without such information, DSMRTR constructs a dependency structure matrix via the differential mutual complement to estimate the one-niche distances. Empirical results show that DSMRTR induces fewer spurious dependencies than RTR does while maintaining enough diversity for EDAs.",

There exist various articles which report that they are incapable of determining the adequate variance, getting trapped even in regions which does not contain any global neither local minimum. In this vein, several proposals intend to insert and to preserve diversity. The proposal range is from modifying the probability distribution by inserting artificial variance, to mutating individuals or the search distribution. This work presents a novel selection method which is used to estimate a weighted covariance matrix equipped with adequate magnitude and directions. The covariance matrix is directly related with the information acquired from the current population, hence no artificial artifacts are inserted. By comparing with state of the art EDAs using test problems and graphical and statistical measures, we evidence that our proposal avoids premature convergence, and solves difficult problems -in the sense of variance preservation-, without the need of complex models, mutation, or explicit variance scaling.",

Evolving neural networks are particularly appealing because of their ability to model an unspecified nonlinear relationship between time series variables. In this work, two new approaches of a previous system, automatic design of artificial neural networks (ADANN) applied to forecast time series, are tackled. In ADANN, the automatic process to design artificial neural networks was carried out by a genetic algorithm (GA). This paper evaluates three methods to evolve neural networks architectures, one carried out with genetic algorithm, a second one carried out with differential evolution algorithm (DE) and the last one using estimation of distribution algorithms (EDA). A comparative study among these three methods with a set of referenced time series will be shown.

        "description": "Variable interdependency, referred to as linkage in genetic algorithms (GAs), has been among the most useful information in evolutionary optimisation. With the aid of linkage information, efficient evolution can be attained by GAs. Among variants of advanced GAs, linkages are either explicitly identified, as in perturbation-based methods, or implicitly extracted, as in estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). As linkage discovery can be considered a matter of information extraction, Shannon's entropy, a renowned metric, has been widely adopted in modern GAs. Despite the validation of theoretical bounds, which is not algorithm-specific, on evaluation complexity of linkage problems, a representative population sizing model for discrete EDAs has been developed based on the distribution of entropy measurement. On the other hand, though entropy metrics have been adopted in recent perturbation-based methods, relevant complexity analysis on these methods is still absent. In this article, we propose a population sizing model for a recently developed linkage identification method, called inductive linkage identification (ILI). The proposed model takes the entropy-based classification algorithm into account and is capable of providing an accurate estimation of population requirement. The adopted modelling approach is different than that for discrete EDAs and may give researchers insights into entropy-based linkage discovery approaches.",

        "description": "Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) identify linkages among genes and build models which decompose a given problem. EDAs have been successfully applied to many real-world problems; however, whether their models indicate the optimal way to decompose the given problem is rarely studied. This paper proposes using the number of function evaluations (N-fe) as the performance measure of EDA models. As a result, the optimal model can be defined as the one that consumes the fewest N-fe on average for EDAs to solve a specific problem. Based on this concept, correct building blocks (BBs) can be defined as groups of genes that construct the optimal model. Similarly, linkages within a BB are defined as the correct linkages of which the specific problem consists. The capabilities of four commonly used linkage-learning metrics, nonlinearity, entropy, simultaneity and differential mutual complement, are investigated based on the above definitions. For certain partially separable problems, none of the above metrics yields difference that is statistically significant between linear and nonlinear gene pairs. Although an optimal threshold still exists to separate linear and nonlinear gene pairs, most existing EDA designs today have not yet characterize such threshold. Based on the idea of N-fe estimation, this paper also proposes a metric enhancer, named eNFE, to enhance existing linkage-learning techniques. Empirical results show that eNFE improves BB identification by eliminating spurious linkages which occur often in most existing EDAs. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

These subgroups provide clues about the main biological processes. Until now, different approaches to this problem have been proposed. Most of them use the mean squared residue as quality measure but relevant and interesting patterns can not be detected such as shifting, or scaling patterns. Furthermore, recent papers show that there exist new coherence patterns involved in different kinds of cancer and tumors such as inverse relationships between genes which can not be captured.|Results: The proposed measure is called Spearman's biclustering measure (SBM) which performs an estimation of the quality of a bicluster based on the non-linear correlation among genes and conditions simultaneously. The search of biclusters is performed by using a evolutionary technique called estimation of distribution algorithms which uses the SBM measure as fitness function. This approach has been examined from different points of view by using artificial and real microarrays. The assessment process has involved the use of quality indexes, a set of bicluster patterns of reference including new patterns and a set of statistical tests. It has been also examined the performance using real microarrays and comparing to different algorithmic approaches such as Bimax, CC, OPSM, Plaid and xMotifs. Conclusions: SBM shows several advantages such as the ability to recognize more complex coherence patterns such as shifting, scaling and inversion and the capability to selectively marginalize genes and conditions depending on the statistical significance.

Recently, it has been reported that the incorporation of mutation into EDAs increases the diversity of genetic information in the population, thereby avoiding premature convergence into a suboptimal solution. In this study, we propose a new mutation operator, a transpose mutation, designed for Bayesian structure learning. It enhances the diversity of the offspring and it increases the possibility of inferring the correct arc direction by considering the arc directions in candidate solutions as bi-directional, using the matrix transpose operator. As compared to the conventional EDAs, the transpose mutation-adopted EDAs are superior and effective algorithms for learning Bayesian networks.",

Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) are a class of evolutionary algorithms particularly suitable for the conception of model-based surrogate techniques.

This paper introduces and evaluates a novel estimation of a distribution algorithm, called L1-regularized Bayesian optimization algorithm, L1BOA. In L1BOA, Bayesian networks as probabilistic models are learned in two steps. First, candidate parents of each variable in Bayesian networks are detected by means of L1-regularized logistic regression, with the aim of leading a sparse but nearly optimized network structure. Second, the greedy search, which is restricted to the candidate parent-child pairs, is deployed to identify the final structure. Compared with the Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA), L1BOA improves the efficiency of structure learning due to the reduction and automated control of network complexity introduced with L1-regularized learning. Experimental studies on different types of benchmark problems show that L1BOA not only outperforms BOA when no prior knowledge about problem structure is available, but also achieves and even exceeds the best performance of BOA that applies explicit controls on network complexity. Furthermore, Bayesian networks built by L1BOA and BOA during evolution are analysed and compared, which demonstrates that L1BOA is able to build simpler, yet more accurate probabilistic models.",

The core of EDAs is a probabilistic model which directly impacts performance of the algorithm. Previous EDAs have used a univariate, bi-variate, or multi-variable probabilistic model each time. However, application of only one probabilistic model may not represent the parental distribution well. This paper advocates the importance of using ensemble probabilistic models in EDAs. We combine the univariate probabilistic model with the bi-variate probabilistic model which learns different population characteristics. To explain how to employ the two probabilistic models, we proposed the Ensemble Self-Guided Genetic Algorithm (eSGGA). The extensive computation results on two NP-hard scheduling problems indicate the advantages of adopting two probabilistic models. Most important of all, eSGGA can avoid the computation effort overhead when compared with other EDAs employing two models. As a result, this paper might point out a next generation approach for EDAs.

        "description": "Understanding the relationship between a search algorithm and the space of problems is a fundamental issue in the optimization field. In this paper, we lay the foundations to elaborate taxonomies of problems under estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). By using an infinite population model and assuming that the selection operator is based on the rank of the solutions, we group optimization problems according to the behavior of the EDA. Throughout the definition of an equivalence relation between functions it is possible to partition the space of problems in equivalence classes in which the algorithm has the same behavior. We show that only the probabilistic model is able to generate different partitions of the set of possible problems and hence, it predetermines the number of different behaviors that the algorithm can exhibit. As a natural consequence of our definitions, all the objective functions are in the same equivalence class when the algorithm does not impose restrictions to the probabilistic model. The taxonomy of problems, which is also valid for finite populations, is studied in depth for a simple EDA that considers independence among the variables of the problem. We provide the sufficient and necessary condition to decide the equivalence between functions and then we develop the operators to describe and count the members of a class. In addition, we show the intrinsic relation between univariate EDAs and the neighborhood system induced by the Hamming distance by proving that all the functions in the same class have the same number of local optima and that they are in the same ranking positions. Finally, we carry out numerical simulations in order to analyze the different behaviors that the algorithm can exhibit for the functions defined over the search space {0, 1}(3).",

History matching is an example of an inverse problem, and there is significant active research on inverse problems in many other scientific and engineering areas. While many techniques from other fields, such as genetic algorithms, evolutionary strategies, differential evolution, particle swarm optimization, and the ensemble Kalman filter have been tried in the oil industry, more recent and effective ideas have yet to be tested. One of these relatively untested ideas is a class of algorithms known as estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). EDAs are population-based algorithms that use probability models to estimate the probability distribution of promising solutions, and then to generate new candidate solutions. EDAs have been shown to be very efficient in very complex high-dimensional problems.|An example of a state-of-the-art EDA is the Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA), which is a multivariate EDA employing Bayesian networks for modeling the relationships between good solutions. The use of a Bayesian network leads to relatively fast convergence as well as high diversity in the matched models. Given the relatively limited number of reservoir simulations used in history matching, EDA-BOA offers the promise of high-quality history matches with a fast convergence rate.|In this paper, we introduce EDAs and describe BOA in detail. We show results of the EDA-BOA algorithm on two history-matching problems. First, we tune the algorithm, demonstrate convergence speed, and search diversity on the PUNQ-S3 synthetic case. Second, we apply the algorithm to a real North Sea turbidite field with multiple wells. In both examples, we show improvements in performance over traditional population-based algorithms.",

Compared to Michigan-style GBML, Pittsburgh-style GBML is expected to achieve more compact solutions. It has been shown that standard recombination operators in EAs do not assure an effective evolutionary search to solve sophisticated problems that contain strong interactions between features. On the other hand, when dealing with real-world classification tasks, irrelevant features not only complicate the problem but also incur unnecessary matchings in GBML systems, which increase the computational cost a lot. To handle the two problems mentioned above in an integrated manner, a new Pittsburgh-style GBML system is proposed. In the proposed method, classifiers are generated and recombined at two levels. At the high level, classifiers are recombined by rule-wise uniform crossover operators since each classifier consists of a variable-size rule set. At the low level, single rules contained in classifiers are reproduced via sampling Bayesian networks that characterize the global statistical information extracted from promising rules found so far. Furthermore, according to the statistical information in the rule population, an embedded approach is presented to detect and remove redundant features incrementally following the evolution of rule population. Results of empirical evaluation show that the proposed method outperforms the original Pittsburgh-style GBML system in terms of classification accuracy while reducing the computational cost. Furthermore, the proposed method is also competitive to other non-evolutionary, highly used machine learning methods. With respect to the performance of feature reduction, the proposed embedded approach is able to deliver solutions with higher classification accuracy when removing the same number of features as other feature reduction techniques do.

        "authors": "Martinez, EEH, Pe\u00f1a, SIV and Soto, ES",
        "description": "In robotics, solving the direct kinematics problem (DKP) for parallel robots is very often more difficult and time consuming than for their serial counterparts. The problem is stated as follows: given the joint variables, the Cartesian variables should be computed, namely the pose of the mobile platform. Most of the time, the DKP requires solving a non-linear system of equations. In addition, given that the system could be non-convex, Newton or Quasi-Newton (Dogleg) based solvers get trapped on local minima. The capacity of such kinds of solvers to find an adequate solution strongly depends on the starting point. A well-known problem is the selection of such a starting point, which requires a priori information about the neighbouring region of the solution. In order to circumvent this issue, this article proposes an efficient method to select and to generate the starting point based on probabilistic learning. Experiments and discussion are presented to show the method performance. The method successfully avoids getting trapped on local minima without the need for human intervention, which increases its robustness when compared with a single Dogleg approach. This proposal can be extended to other structures, to any non-linear system of equations, and of course, to non-linear optimization problems.",

        "authors": "Gwak, J and Sim, KM",
        "description": "In agent-mediated negotiation systems, the majority of the research focused on finding negotiation strategies for optimizing price only. However, in negotiation systems with time constraints (e.g., resource negotiations for Grid and Cloud computing), it is crucial to optimize either or both price and negotiation speed based on preferences of participants for improving efficiency and increasing utilization. To this end, this work presents the design and implementation of negotiation agents that can optimize both price and negotiation speed (for the given preference settings of these parameters) under a negotiation setting of complete information. Then, to support negotiations with incomplete information, this work deals with the problem of finding effective negotiation strategies of agents by using coevolutionary learning, which results in optimal negotiation outcomes. In the coevolutionary learning method used here, two types of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) such as conventional EDAs (S-EDAs) and novel improved dynamic diversity controlling EDAs ((IDC)-C-2-EDAs) were adopted for comparative studies. A series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance for coevolving effective negotiation strategies using the EDAs. In the experiments, each agent adopts three representative preference criteria: (1) placing more emphasis on optimizing more price, (2) placing equal emphasis on optimizing exact price and speed and (3) placing more emphasis on optimizing more speed. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the coevolutionary learning adopting (IDC)-C-2-EDAs because it generally coevolved effective converged negotiation strategies (close to the optimum) while the coevolutionary learning adopting S-EDAs often failed to coevolve such strategies within a reasonable number of generations.",

        "description": "Parallelization is a straightforward approach to enhance the efficiency for evolutionary computation due to its inherently parallel nature. Since NVIDIA released the compute unified device architecture (CUDA), graphic processing units have enabled lots of scalable parallel programs in a wide range of fields. However, parallelization of model building for EDAs is rarely studied. In this paper, we propose two implementations on CUDA to speed up the model building in the extended compact genetic algorithm (ECGA). The first implementation is algorithmically identical to original ECGA. Aiming at a greater speed boost, the second implementation modifies the model building. It slightly decreases the accuracy of models in exchange for more speedup. Empirically, the first implementation achieves a speedup of roughly 359 to the baseline on 500-bit trap problem with order 5, and the second implementation achieves a speedup of roughly 506 to the baseline on the same problem. Finally, both of our implementations scale up to 9,800-bit trap problem with order 5 on one single Tesla C2050 GPU card.",

        "description": "Protein function prediction is an important problem in functional genomics. Typically, protein sequences are represented by feature vectors. A major problem of protein datasets that increase the complexity of classification models is their large number of features. The process of drug discovery often involves the use of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to identify chemical structures that could have good inhibitory effects on specific targets and have low toxicity (non-specific activity). QSAR models are regression or classification models used in the chemical and biological sciences. Because of high dimensionality problems, a feature selection problem is imminent. In this study, we thus employ a hybrid Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) based filter-wrapper methodology to simultaneously extract informative feature subsets and build robust QSAR models. The performance of the algorithm was tested on the benchmark classification challenge datasets obtained from the CoePRa competition platform, developed in 2006. Our results clearly demonstrate the efficacy of a hybrid EDA filter-wrapper algorithm in comparison to the results reported earlier.",

        "description": "Objective: Is it possible to predict the severity staging of a Parkinson's disease (PD) patient using scores of non-motor symptoms? This is the kickoff question for a machine learning approach to classify two widely known PD severity indexes using individual tests from a broad set of non-motor PD clinical scales only.|Methods: The Hoehn & Yahr index and clinical impression of severity index are global measures of PD severity. They constitute the labels to be assigned in two supervised classification problems using only non-motor symptom tests as predictor variables. Such predictors come from a wide range of PD symptoms, such as cognitive impairment, psychiatric complications, autonomic dysfunction or sleep disturbance. The classification was coupled with a feature subset selection task using an advanced evolutionary algorithm, namely an estimation of distribution algorithm.|Results: Results show how five different classification paradigms using a wrapper feature selection scheme are capable of predicting each of the class variables with estimated accuracy in the range of 72-92%. In addition, classification into the main three severity categories (Mild, moderate and severe) was split into dichotomic problems where binary classifiers perform better and select different subsets of non-motor symptoms. The number of jointly selected symptoms throughout the whole process was low, suggesting a link between the selected non-motor symptoms and the general severity of the disease.|Conclusion: Quantitative results are discussed from a medical point of view, reflecting a clear translation to the clinical manifestations of PD. Moreover, results include a brief panel of non-motor symptoms that could help clinical practitioners to identify patients who are at different stages of the disease from a limited set of symptoms, such as hallucinations, fainting, inability to control body sphincters or believing in unlikely facts.

        "title": "An augmented EDA with dynamic diversity control and local neighborhood search for coevolution of optimal negotiation strategies",
        "authors": "Gwak, J and Sim, KM",
        "description": "In this paper, we present an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) augmented with enhanced dynamic diversity controlling and local improvement methods to solve competitive coevolution problems for agent-based automated negotiations. Since optimal negotiation strategies ensure that interacting agents negotiate optimally, finding such strategies-particularly, for the agents having incomplete information about their opponents-is an important and challenging issue to support agent-based automated negotiation systems. To address this issue, we consider the problem of finding optimal negotiation strategies for a bilateral negotiation between self-interested agents with incomplete information through an EDA-based coevolution mechanism. Due to the competitive nature of the agents, EDAs should be able to deal with competitive coevolution based on two asymmetric populations each consisting of self-interested agents. However, finding optimal negotiation solutions via coevolutionary learning using conventional EDAs is difficult because the EDAs suffer from premature convergence and their search capability deteriorates during coevolution. To solve these problems, even though we have previously devised the dynamic diversity controlling EDA ((DC)-C-2-EDA), which is mainly characterized by a diversification and refinement (DR) procedure, (DC)-C-2-EDA suffers from the population reinitialization problem that leads to a computational overhead. To reduce the computational overhead and to achieve further improvements in terms of solution accuracy, we have devised an improved (DC)-C-2-EDA ((IDC)-C-2-EDA) by adopting an enhanced DR procedure and a local neighborhood search (LNS) method. Favorable empirical results support the effectiveness of the proposed (IDC)-C-2-EDA compared to conventional and the other proposed EDAs. Furthermore, (IDC)-C-2-EDA finds solutions very close to the optimum.",

        "description": "We describe a parameter-free estimation-of-distribution algorithm (EDA) called the adapted maximum-likelihood Gaussian model iterated density-estimation evolutionary algorithm (AMaLGaM-IDEA, or AMaLGaM for short) for numerical optimization. AMaLGaM is benchmarked within the 2009 black box optimization benchmarking (BBOB) framework and compared to a variant with incremental model building (iAMaLGaM). We study the implications of factorizing the covariance matrix in the Gaussian distribution, to use only a few or no covariances. Further, AMaLGaM and iAMaLGaM are also evaluated on the noisy BBOB problems and we assess how well multiple evaluations per solution can average out noise. Experimental evidence suggests that parameter-free AMaLGaM can solve a wide range of problems efficiently with perceived polynomial scalability, including multimodal problems, obtaining the best or near-best results among all algorithms tested in 2009 on functions such as the step-ellipsoid and Katsuuras, but failing to locate the optimum within the time limit on skew Rastrigin-Bueche separable and Lunacek bi-Rastrigin in higher dimensions. AMaLGaM is found to be more robust to noise than iAMaLGaM due to the larger required population size. Using few or no covariances hinders the EDA from dealing with rotations of the search space. Finally, the use of noise averaging is found to be less efficient than the direct application of the EDA unless the noise is uniformly distributed. AMaLGaM was among the best performing algorithms submitted to the BBOB workshop in 2009.",

        "description": "Estimation of distribution algorithms are known as powerful evolutionary algorithms that have been widely used for diverse types of problems. However, they have not been extensively developed for permutation-based problems. Recently, some progress has been made in this area by introducing probability models on rankings to optimize permutation domain problems. In particular, the Mallows model and the Generalized Mallows model demonstrated their effectiveness when used with estimation of distribution algorithms. Motivated by these advances, in this paper we introduce a Thurstone order statistics model, called Plackett-Luce, to the framework of estimation of distribution algorithms. In order to prove the potential of the proposed algorithm, we consider two different permutation problems: the linear ordering problem and the flowshop scheduling problem. In addition, the results are compared with those obtained by the Mallows and the Generalized Mallows proposals. Conducted experiments demonstrate that the Plackett-Luce model is the best performing model for solving the linear ordering problem. However, according to the experimental results, the Generalized Mallows model turns out to be very robust obtaining very competitive results for both problems, especially for the permutation flowshop scheduling problem.",

Problems requiring deep dependence in their probability structure see such rapid stochastic drift that the usual methods for controlling drift are unable to compensate. We propose a new alternative, analogous to likelihood weighting of evidence. We demonstrate in a small-scale experiment that it does counteract the drift, sufficiently to leave EDA-GP systems subject to similar levels of stochastic drift to other EDAs.",

This paper utilizes building-block-wise distances to define a new distance metric, the one-niche distance. For those EDAs which provide explicit linkage information, the one-niche distances can be directly incorporated into RTR. For EDAs without such information, DSMRTR constructs a dependency structure matrix via the differential mutual complement to estimate the one-niche distances. Empirical results show that DSMRTR induces fewer spurious dependencies than RTR does while maintaining enough diversity for EDAs.",

The proposal range is from modifying the probability distribution by inserting artificial variance, to mutating individuals or the search distribution. This work presents a novel selection method which is used to estimate a weighted covariance matrix equipped with adequate magnitude and directions. The covariance matrix is directly related with the information acquired from the current population, hence no artificial artifacts are inserted.

The heuristic methods, however, lack the mathematical rigor required in the inference of a probability distribution's parameters. In this work, we propose the use of the Nonparametric Bayesian Model known as Dirichlet Process to fit the number of clusters given the data in a modified Population Based Incremental Learning (PBIL) model. We compare our approach with similar techniques that also use multimodal probability distributions to enhance the quality of the search in other EDA approaches. Our approach shows improvements by reducing the number of generations needed to find good results that are comparable to the state of the art in clustered EDA.",

In this paper, the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is modeled as a novel EDA in the context of multi-objective optimization. RBM is an energy-based stochastic neural network. The probabilities of the joint configuration over the visible and hidden units in the network are trained using contrastive divergence until the distribution over the global state reaches a certain level of thermal equilibrium. Subsequently, the probabilistic model is constructed using the energy function of the network. In addition, clustering in the phenotypic space is incorporated into the proposed algorithm. The effects on clustering and the stability of the trained network on optimization performance are rigorously examined. Experimental studies are conducted to analyze the performance of the proposed algorithm in scalable problems with large number of objective functions and decision variables. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Each role is associated to specific tasks in the optimization process and employs different estimation of distribution methods. By combining estimation of distribution, clusterization of the objective domain, and the crowding distance assignment of NSGA-II, it was possible to extract more information about the optimization problem, thus enabling an efficient solution of large scale decision variable problems. Regarding the test problems, quality indicators, and GDE3, MOEA/D and NSGA-II methods, the combination of strategies incorporated into the MOEDABC algorithm has presented competitive results, which indicate this method as a useful optimization tool for the class of problems considered.",

        "description": "Time series forecasting is an important tool to support both individual and organizational decisions (e.g. planning production resources). In recent years, a large literature has evolved on the use of evolutionary artificial neural networks (EANN) in many forecasting applications. Evolving neural networks are particularly appealing because of their ability to model an unspecified nonlinear relationship between time series variables. In this work, two new approaches of a previous system, automatic design of artificial neural networks (ADANN) applied to forecast time series, are tackled. In ADANN, the automatic process to design artificial neural networks was carried out by a genetic algorithm (GA). This paper evaluates three methods to evolve neural networks architectures, one carried out with genetic algorithm, a second one carried out with differential evolution algorithm (DE) and the last one using estimation of distribution algorithms (EDA). A comparative study among these three methods with a set of referenced time series will be shown. In this paper, we also compare ADANN forecasting ability against a forecasting tool called Forecast Pro(A (R)) (FP) software, using five benchmark time series. The object of this study is to try to improve the final forecasting getting an accurate system.",

        "description": "Variable interdependency, referred to as linkage in genetic algorithms (GAs), has been among the most useful information in evolutionary optimisation. With the aid of linkage information, efficient evolution can be attained by GAs. Among variants of advanced GAs, linkages are either explicitly identified, as in perturbation-based methods, or implicitly extracted, as in estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). As linkage discovery can be considered a matter of information extraction, Shannon's entropy, a renowned metric, has been widely adopted in modern GAs. Despite the validation of theoretical bounds, which is not algorithm-specific, on evaluation complexity of linkage problems, a representative population sizing model for discrete EDAs has been developed based on the distribution of entropy measurement. On the other hand, though entropy metrics have been adopted in recent perturbation-based methods, relevant complexity analysis on these methods is still absent. In this article, we propose a population sizing model for a recently developed linkage identification method, called inductive linkage identification (ILI). The proposed model takes the entropy-based classification algorithm into account and is capable of providing an accurate estimation of population requirement. The adopted modelling approach is different than that for discrete EDAs and may give researchers insights into entropy-based linkage discovery approaches.",

        "description": "Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) identify linkages among genes and build models which decompose a given problem. EDAs have been successfully applied to many real-world problems; however, whether their models indicate the optimal way to decompose the given problem is rarely studied. This paper proposes using the number of function evaluations (N-fe) as the performance measure of EDA models. As a result, the optimal model can be defined as the one that consumes the fewest N-fe on average for EDAs to solve a specific problem. Based on this concept, correct building blocks (BBs) can be defined as groups of genes that construct the optimal model. Similarly, linkages within a BB are defined as the correct linkages of which the specific problem consists. The capabilities of four commonly used linkage-learning metrics, nonlinearity, entropy, simultaneity and differential mutual complement, are investigated based on the above definitions. For certain partially separable problems, none of the above metrics yields difference that is statistically significant between linear and nonlinear gene pairs. Although an optimal threshold still exists to separate linear and nonlinear gene pairs, most existing EDA designs today have not yet characterize such threshold. Based on the idea of N-fe estimation, this paper also proposes a metric enhancer, named eNFE, to enhance existing linkage-learning techniques. Empirical results show that eNFE improves BB identification by eliminating spurious linkages which occur often in most existing EDAs. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

        "description": "Background: One of the emerging techniques for performing the analysis of the DNA microarray data known as biclustering is the search of subsets of genes and conditions which are coherently expressed. These subgroups provide clues about the main biological processes. Until now, different approaches to this problem have been proposed. Most of them use the mean squared residue as quality measure but relevant and interesting patterns can not be detected such as shifting, or scaling patterns. Furthermore, recent papers show that there exist new coherence patterns involved in different kinds of cancer and tumors such as inverse relationships between genes which can not be captured.|Results: The proposed measure is called Spearman's biclustering measure (SBM) which performs an estimation of the quality of a bicluster based on the non-linear correlation among genes and conditions simultaneously. The search of biclusters is performed by using a evolutionary technique called estimation of distribution algorithms which uses the SBM measure as fitness function. This approach has been examined from different points of view by using artificial and real microarrays. The assessment process has involved the use of quality indexes, a set of bicluster patterns of reference including new patterns and a set of statistical tests. It has been also examined the performance using real microarrays and comparing to different algorithmic approaches such as Bimax, CC, OPSM, Plaid and xMotifs. Conclusions: SBM shows several advantages such as the ability to recognize more complex coherence patterns such as shifting, scaling and inversion and the capability to selectively marginalize genes and conditions depending on the statistical significance.

In this study, we propose a new mutation operator, a transpose mutation, designed for Bayesian structure learning. It enhances the diversity of the offspring and it increases the possibility of inferring the correct arc direction by considering the arc directions in candidate solutions as bi-directional, using the matrix transpose operator. As compared to the conventional EDAs, the transpose mutation-adopted EDAs are superior and effective algorithms for learning Bayesian networks.",

This paper introduces and evaluates a novel estimation of a distribution algorithm, called L1-regularized Bayesian optimization algorithm, L1BOA. In L1BOA, Bayesian networks as probabilistic models are learned in two steps. First, candidate parents of each variable in Bayesian networks are detected by means of L1-regularized logistic regression, with the aim of leading a sparse but nearly optimized network structure. Second, the greedy search, which is restricted to the candidate parent-child pairs, is deployed to identify the final structure. Compared with the Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA), L1BOA improves the efficiency of structure learning due to the reduction and automated control of network complexity introduced with L1-regularized learning. Experimental studies on different types of benchmark problems show that L1BOA not only outperforms BOA when no prior knowledge about problem structure is available, but also achieves and even exceeds the best performance of BOA that applies explicit controls on network complexity. Furthermore, Bayesian networks built by L1BOA and BOA during evolution are analysed and compared, which demonstrates that L1BOA is able to build simpler, yet more accurate probabilistic models.",

The core of EDAs is a probabilistic model which directly impacts performance of the algorithm. Previous EDAs have used a univariate, bi-variate, or multi-variable probabilistic model each time. However, application of only one probabilistic model may not represent the parental distribution well. This paper advocates the importance of using ensemble probabilistic models in EDAs. We combine the univariate probabilistic model with the bi-variate probabilistic model which learns different population characteristics. To explain how to employ the two probabilistic models, we proposed the Ensemble Self-Guided Genetic Algorithm (eSGGA). The extensive computation results on two NP-hard scheduling problems indicate the advantages of adopting two probabilistic models. Most important of all, eSGGA can avoid the computation effort overhead when compared with other EDAs employing two models. As a result, this paper might point out a next generation approach for EDAs.

        "description": "Understanding the relationship between a search algorithm and the space of problems is a fundamental issue in the optimization field. In this paper, we lay the foundations to elaborate taxonomies of problems under estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). By using an infinite population model and assuming that the selection operator is based on the rank of the solutions, we group optimization problems according to the behavior of the EDA. Throughout the definition of an equivalence relation between functions it is possible to partition the space of problems in equivalence classes in which the algorithm has the same behavior. We show that only the probabilistic model is able to generate different partitions of the set of possible problems and hence, it predetermines the number of different behaviors that the algorithm can exhibit. As a natural consequence of our definitions, all the objective functions are in the same equivalence class when the algorithm does not impose restrictions to the probabilistic model. The taxonomy of problems, which is also valid for finite populations, is studied in depth for a simple EDA that considers independence among the variables of the problem. We provide the sufficient and necessary condition to decide the equivalence between functions and then we develop the operators to describe and count the members of a class. In addition, we show the intrinsic relation between univariate EDAs and the neighborhood system induced by the Hamming distance by proving that all the functions in the same class have the same number of local optima and that they are in the same ranking positions. Finally, we carry out numerical simulations in order to analyze the different behaviors that the algorithm can exhibit for the functions defined over the search space {0, 1}(3).",

History matching is an example of an inverse problem, and there is significant active research on inverse problems in many other scientific and engineering areas. While many techniques from other fields, such as genetic algorithms, evolutionary strategies, differential evolution, particle swarm optimization, and the ensemble Kalman filter have been tried in the oil industry, more recent and effective ideas have yet to be tested. One of these relatively untested ideas is a class of algorithms known as estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). EDAs are population-based algorithms that use probability models to estimate the probability distribution of promising solutions, and then to generate new candidate solutions. EDAs have been shown to be very efficient in very complex high-dimensional problems.|An example of a state-of-the-art EDA is the Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA), which is a multivariate EDA employing Bayesian networks for modeling the relationships between good solutions. The use of a Bayesian network leads to relatively fast convergence as well as high diversity in the matched models. Given the relatively limited number of reservoir simulations used in history matching, EDA-BOA offers the promise of high-quality history matches with a fast convergence rate.|In this paper, we introduce EDAs and describe BOA in detail. We show results of the EDA-BOA algorithm on two history-matching problems. First, we tune the algorithm, demonstrate convergence speed, and search diversity on the PUNQ-S3 synthetic case.

To handle the two problems mentioned above in an integrated manner, a new Pittsburgh-style GBML system is proposed. In the proposed method, classifiers are generated and recombined at two levels. At the high level, classifiers are recombined by rule-wise uniform crossover operators since each classifier consists of a variable-size rule set. At the low level, single rules contained in classifiers are reproduced via sampling Bayesian networks that characterize the global statistical information extracted from promising rules found so far. Furthermore, according to the statistical information in the rule population, an embedded approach is presented to detect and remove redundant features incrementally following the evolution of rule population. Results of empirical evaluation show that the proposed method outperforms the original Pittsburgh-style GBML system in terms of classification accuracy while reducing the computational cost. Furthermore, the proposed method is also competitive to other non-evolutionary, highly used machine learning methods. With respect to the performance of feature reduction, the proposed embedded approach is able to deliver solutions with higher classification accuracy when removing the same number of features as other feature reduction techniques do.

        "description": "Hybridization of global and local searches is a well-known technique for optimization algorithms. Hill climbing is one of the local search methods. On estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), hill climbing strengthens the signals of dependencies on correlated variables and improves the quality of model building, which reduces the required population size and convergence time. However, hill climbing also consumes extra computational time. In this paper, analytical models are developed to investigate the effects of combining two different hill climbers with the extended compact genetic algorithm and the dependency structure matrix genetic algorithm. By using the one-max problem and the 5-bit non-overlapping trap problem as the test problems, the performances of different hill climbers are compared. Both analytical models and experiments reveal that the greedy hill climber reduces the number of function evaluations for EDAs to find the global optimum.",

By iterative filtering for quality solution from competing ones, the probability model eventually approximates the distribution of global optimum solutions. In contrast to classic evolutionary algorithms (EAs), EDA framework is flexible and is able to handle inter variable dependence, which usually imposes difficulties on classic EAs. The success of EDA relies on effective and efficient building of the probability model. This paper facilitates EDA from the adaptive memory programming (AMP) domain which has developed several improved forms of EAs using the Cyber-EA framework.

They are able to take advantage of correlation structure to drive the search more efficiently, and they are able to provide insights about the structure of the search space. However, model building in high dimensions is extremely challenging and as a result existing EDAs lose their strengths in large scale problems.|Large scale continuous global optimisation is key to many real-world problems of modern days. Scaling up EAs to large scale problems has become one of the biggest challenges of the field.|This paper pins down some fundamental roots of the problem and makes a start at developing a new and generic framework to yield effective EDA-type algorithms for large scale continuous global optimisation problems. Our concept is to introduce an ensemble of random projections of the set of fittest search points to low dimensions as a basis for developing a new and generic divide-and-conquer methodology. This is rooted in the theory of random projections developed in theoretical computer science, and will exploit recent advances of non-asymptotic random matrix theory.",

        "description": "In robotics, solving the direct kinematics problem (DKP) for parallel robots is very often more difficult and time consuming than for their serial counterparts. The problem is stated as follows: given the joint variables, the Cartesian variables should be computed, namely the pose of the mobile platform. Most of the time, the DKP requires solving a non-linear system of equations. In addition, given that the system could be non-convex, Newton or Quasi-Newton (Dogleg) based solvers get trapped on local minima. The capacity of such kinds of solvers to find an adequate solution strongly depends on the starting point. A well-known problem is the selection of such a starting point, which requires a priori information about the neighbouring region of the solution. In order to circumvent this issue, this article proposes an efficient method to select and to generate the starting point based on probabilistic learning. Experiments and discussion are presented to show the method performance. The method successfully avoids getting trapped on local minima without the need for human intervention, which increases its robustness when compared with a single Dogleg approach. This proposal can be extended to other structures, to any non-linear system of equations, and of course, to non-linear optimization problems.",

        "description": "In agent-mediated negotiation systems, the majority of the research focused on finding negotiation strategies for optimizing price only. However, in negotiation systems with time constraints (e.g., resource negotiations for Grid and Cloud computing), it is crucial to optimize either or both price and negotiation speed based on preferences of participants for improving efficiency and increasing utilization. To this end, this work presents the design and implementation of negotiation agents that can optimize both price and negotiation speed (for the given preference settings of these parameters) under a negotiation setting of complete information. Then, to support negotiations with incomplete information, this work deals with the problem of finding effective negotiation strategies of agents by using coevolutionary learning, which results in optimal negotiation outcomes. In the coevolutionary learning method used here, two types of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) such as conventional EDAs (S-EDAs) and novel improved dynamic diversity controlling EDAs ((IDC)-C-2-EDAs) were adopted for comparative studies. A series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance for coevolving effective negotiation strategies using the EDAs. In the experiments, each agent adopts three representative preference criteria: (1) placing more emphasis on optimizing more price, (2) placing equal emphasis on optimizing exact price and speed and (3) placing more emphasis on optimizing more speed. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the coevolutionary learning adopting (IDC)-C-2-EDAs because it generally coevolved effective converged negotiation strategies (close to the optimum) while the coevolutionary learning adopting S-EDAs often failed to coevolve such strategies within a reasonable number of generations.",

Since NVIDIA released the compute unified device architecture (CUDA), graphic processing units have enabled lots of scalable parallel programs in a wide range of fields.

In this paper, we propose two implementations on CUDA to speed up the model building in the extended compact genetic algorithm (ECGA). The first implementation is algorithmically identical to original ECGA. Aiming at a greater speed boost, the second implementation modifies the model building. It slightly decreases the accuracy of models in exchange for more speedup. Empirically, the first implementation achieves a speedup of roughly 359 to the baseline on 500-bit trap problem with order 5, and the second implementation achieves a speedup of roughly 506 to the baseline on the same problem. Finally, both of our implementations scale up to 9,800-bit trap problem with order 5 on one single Tesla C2050 GPU card.",

This is the kickoff question for a machine learning approach to classify two widely known PD severity indexes using individual tests from a broad set of non-motor PD clinical scales only.|Methods: The Hoehn & Yahr index and clinical impression of severity index are global measures of PD severity. They constitute the labels to be assigned in two supervised classification problems using only non-motor symptom tests as predictor variables. Such predictors come from a wide range of PD symptoms, such as cognitive impairment, psychiatric complications, autonomic dysfunction or sleep disturbance. The classification was coupled with a feature subset selection task using an advanced evolutionary algorithm, namely an estimation of distribution algorithm.|Results: Results show how five different classification paradigms using a wrapper feature selection scheme are capable of predicting each of the class variables with estimated accuracy in the range of 72-92%. In addition, classification into the main three severity categories (Mild, moderate and severe) was split into dichotomic problems where binary classifiers perform better and select different subsets of non-motor symptoms. The number of jointly selected symptoms throughout the whole process was low, suggesting a link between the selected non-motor symptoms and the general severity of the disease.|Conclusion: Quantitative results are discussed from a medical point of view, reflecting a clear translation to the clinical manifestations of PD. Moreover, results include a brief panel of non-motor symptoms that could help clinical practitioners to identify patients who are at different stages of the disease from a limited set of symptoms, such as hallucinations, fainting, inability to control body sphincters or believing in unlikely facts.

        "description": "In this paper, we present an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) augmented with enhanced dynamic diversity controlling and local improvement methods to solve competitive coevolution problems for agent-based automated negotiations. Since optimal negotiation strategies ensure that interacting agents negotiate optimally, finding such strategies-particularly, for the agents having incomplete information about their opponents-is an important and challenging issue to support agent-based automated negotiation systems. To address this issue, we consider the problem of finding optimal negotiation strategies for a bilateral negotiation between self-interested agents with incomplete information through an EDA-based coevolution mechanism. Due to the competitive nature of the agents, EDAs should be able to deal with competitive coevolution based on two asymmetric populations each consisting of self-interested agents. However, finding optimal negotiation solutions via coevolutionary learning using conventional EDAs is difficult because the EDAs suffer from premature convergence and their search capability deteriorates during coevolution. To solve these problems, even though we have previously devised the dynamic diversity controlling EDA ((DC)-C-2-EDA), which is mainly characterized by a diversification and refinement (DR) procedure, (DC)-C-2-EDA suffers from the population reinitialization problem that leads to a computational overhead. To reduce the computational overhead and to achieve further improvements in terms of solution accuracy, we have devised an improved (DC)-C-2-EDA ((IDC)-C-2-EDA) by adopting an enhanced DR procedure and a local neighborhood search (LNS) method. Favorable empirical results support the effectiveness of the proposed (IDC)-C-2-EDA compared to conventional and the other proposed EDAs. Furthermore, (IDC)-C-2-EDA finds solutions very close to the optimum.",

AMaLGaM is benchmarked within the 2009 black box optimization benchmarking (BBOB) framework and compared to a variant with incremental model building (iAMaLGaM). We study the implications of factorizing the covariance matrix in the Gaussian distribution, to use only a few or no covariances. Further, AMaLGaM and iAMaLGaM are also evaluated on the noisy BBOB problems and we assess how well multiple evaluations per solution can average out noise. Experimental evidence suggests that parameter-free AMaLGaM can solve a wide range of problems efficiently with perceived polynomial scalability, including multimodal problems, obtaining the best or near-best results among all algorithms tested in 2009 on functions such as the step-ellipsoid and Katsuuras, but failing to locate the optimum within the time limit on skew Rastrigin-Bueche separable and Lunacek bi-Rastrigin in higher dimensions. AMaLGaM is found to be more robust to noise than iAMaLGaM due to the larger required population size. Using few or no covariances hinders the EDA from dealing with rotations of the search space. Finally, the use of noise averaging is found to be less efficient than the direct application of the EDA unless the noise is uniformly distributed. AMaLGaM was among the best performing algorithms submitted to the BBOB workshop in 2009.",

Recently, some progress has been made in this area by introducing probability models on rankings to optimize permutation domain problems. In particular, the Mallows model and the Generalized Mallows model demonstrated their effectiveness when used with estimation of distribution algorithms. Motivated by these advances, in this paper we introduce a Thurstone order statistics model, called Plackett-Luce, to the framework of estimation of distribution algorithms. In order to prove the potential of the proposed algorithm, we consider two different permutation problems: the linear ordering problem and the flowshop scheduling problem. In addition, the results are compared with those obtained by the Mallows and the Generalized Mallows proposals. Conducted experiments demonstrate that the Plackett-Luce model is the best performing model for solving the linear ordering problem. However, according to the experimental results, the Generalized Mallows model turns out to be very robust obtaining very competitive results for both problems, especially for the permutation flowshop scheduling problem.",

This equivalence allows to simultaneously perform model selection and robust estimation of the natural gradient. Finally, we interpet Linear Programming relaxation as an example of Stochastic Relaxation, with respect to the regular gradient.",

The non-zero coefficients of the Walsh transform produce a hypergraph representation of structure of a binary fitness function; however, computation of all Walsh coefficients requires exhaustive evaluation of the search space. In this paper, we propose a stochastic method of determining Walsh coefficients for hyperedges contained within the selected subset of the variables (complete local structure). This method also detects parts of hyperedges which cut the boundary of the selected variable set (partial structure), which may be used to incrementally build an approximation of the problem hypergraph.",

Stochastic sampling drift has been heavily researched in EDA optimization but not in EDAs applied to genetic programming (EDA-GP). We show that, for EDA-GPs using probabilistic prototype tree models, stochastic drift in sampling and selection is a serious problem, inhibiting scaling to complex problems. Problems requiring deep dependence in their probability structure see such rapid stochastic drift that the usual methods for controlling drift are unable to compensate. We propose a new alternative, analogous to likelihood weighting of evidence. We demonstrate in a small-scale experiment that it does counteract the drift, sufficiently to leave EDA-GP systems subject to similar levels of stochastic drift to other EDAs.",

The restricted tournament replacement (RTR) is a well-known niching scheme in the field of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). However, RTR induces spurious dependencies among variables, which impair the performance of EDAs. This paper utilizes building-block-wise distances to define a new distance metric, the one-niche distance. For those EDAs which provide explicit linkage information, the one-niche distances can be directly incorporated into RTR. For EDAs without such information, DSMRTR constructs a dependency structure matrix via the differential mutual complement to estimate the one-niche distances. Empirical results show that DSMRTR induces fewer spurious dependencies than RTR does while maintaining enough diversity for EDAs.",

The resulting formulae explicitly introduces information about the fitness landscape for the Gaussian parameters computation, in consequence, the Gaussian distribution obtains a better bias to sample intensively the most promising regions than simply using the maximum likelihood estimator of the selected set. In addition, the BUMDA formulae needs only one user parameter. Accordingly to the experimental results, the BUMDA excels in its niche of application.

This proposed method is applied in the segmentation of the hollow core in microscopic images of photonic crystal fibers and it is also used to segment the human heart and ventricular areas from datasets of computed tomography and magnetic resonance images, respectively. Moreover, to evaluate the performance of the medical image segmentations compared to regions outlined by experts, a set of similarity measures has been adopted. The experimental results suggest that the proposed image segmentation method outperforms the traditional active contour model and the interactive Tseng method in terms of segmentation accuracy and stability.",

There exist various articles which report that they are incapable of determining the adequate variance, getting trapped even in regions which does not contain any global neither local minimum. In this vein, several proposals intend to insert and to preserve diversity. The proposal range is from modifying the probability distribution by inserting artificial variance, to mutating individuals or the search distribution. This work presents a novel selection method which is used to estimate a weighted covariance matrix equipped with adequate magnitude and directions. The covariance matrix is directly related with the information acquired from the current population, hence no artificial artifacts are inserted. By comparing with state of the art EDAs using test problems and graphical and statistical measures, we evidence that our proposal avoids premature convergence, and solves difficult problems -in the sense of variance preservation-, without the need of complex models, mutation, or explicit variance scaling.",

Most proposals use a fixed number of groups or clusters, and other works use heuristic approaches to find the right number of clusters in the search space without any previous information. The heuristic methods, however, lack the mathematical rigor required in the inference of a probability distribution's parameters. In this work, we propose the use of the Nonparametric Bayesian Model known as Dirichlet Process to fit the number of clusters given the data in a modified Population Based Incremental Learning (PBIL) model. We compare our approach with similar techniques that also use multimodal probability distributions to enhance the quality of the search in other EDA approaches.

In recent years, a large literature has evolved on the use of evolutionary artificial neural networks (EANN) in many forecasting applications. Evolving neural networks are particularly appealing because of their ability to model an unspecified nonlinear relationship between time series variables. In this work, two new approaches of a previous system, automatic design of artificial neural networks (ADANN) applied to forecast time series, are tackled. In ADANN, the automatic process to design artificial neural networks was carried out by a genetic algorithm (GA). This paper evaluates three methods to evolve neural networks architectures, one carried out with genetic algorithm, a second one carried out with differential evolution algorithm (DE) and the last one using estimation of distribution algorithms (EDA). A comparative study among these three methods with a set of referenced time series will be shown. In this paper, we also compare ADANN forecasting ability against a forecasting tool called Forecast Pro(A (R)) (FP) software, using five benchmark time series. The object of this study is to try to improve the final forecasting getting an accurate system.",

        "description": "Variable interdependency, referred to as linkage in genetic algorithms (GAs), has been among the most useful information in evolutionary optimisation. With the aid of linkage information, efficient evolution can be attained by GAs. Among variants of advanced GAs, linkages are either explicitly identified, as in perturbation-based methods, or implicitly extracted, as in estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). As linkage discovery can be considered a matter of information extraction, Shannon's entropy, a renowned metric, has been widely adopted in modern GAs. Despite the validation of theoretical bounds, which is not algorithm-specific, on evaluation complexity of linkage problems, a representative population sizing model for discrete EDAs has been developed based on the distribution of entropy measurement. On the other hand, though entropy metrics have been adopted in recent perturbation-based methods, relevant complexity analysis on these methods is still absent. In this article, we propose a population sizing model for a recently developed linkage identification method, called inductive linkage identification (ILI). The proposed model takes the entropy-based classification algorithm into account and is capable of providing an accurate estimation of population requirement. The adopted modelling approach is different than that for discrete EDAs and may give researchers insights into entropy-based linkage discovery approaches.",

        "description": "Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) identify linkages among genes and build models which decompose a given problem. EDAs have been successfully applied to many real-world problems; however, whether their models indicate the optimal way to decompose the given problem is rarely studied. This paper proposes using the number of function evaluations (N-fe) as the performance measure of EDA models. As a result, the optimal model can be defined as the one that consumes the fewest N-fe on average for EDAs to solve a specific problem. Based on this concept, correct building blocks (BBs) can be defined as groups of genes that construct the optimal model. Similarly, linkages within a BB are defined as the correct linkages of which the specific problem consists. The capabilities of four commonly used linkage-learning metrics, nonlinearity, entropy, simultaneity and differential mutual complement, are investigated based on the above definitions. For certain partially separable problems, none of the above metrics yields difference that is statistically significant between linear and nonlinear gene pairs. Although an optimal threshold still exists to separate linear and nonlinear gene pairs, most existing EDA designs today have not yet characterize such threshold. Based on the idea of N-fe estimation, this paper also proposes a metric enhancer, named eNFE, to enhance existing linkage-learning techniques. Empirical results show that eNFE improves BB identification by eliminating spurious linkages which occur often in most existing EDAs. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

        "description": "Background: One of the emerging techniques for performing the analysis of the DNA microarray data known as biclustering is the search of subsets of genes and conditions which are coherently expressed. These subgroups provide clues about the main biological processes. Until now, different approaches to this problem have been proposed. Most of them use the mean squared residue as quality measure but relevant and interesting patterns can not be detected such as shifting, or scaling patterns. Furthermore, recent papers show that there exist new coherence patterns involved in different kinds of cancer and tumors such as inverse relationships between genes which can not be captured.|Results: The proposed measure is called Spearman's biclustering measure (SBM) which performs an estimation of the quality of a bicluster based on the non-linear correlation among genes and conditions simultaneously. The search of biclusters is performed by using a evolutionary technique called estimation of distribution algorithms which uses the SBM measure as fitness function. This approach has been examined from different points of view by using artificial and real microarrays. The assessment process has involved the use of quality indexes, a set of bicluster patterns of reference including new patterns and a set of statistical tests. It has been also examined the performance using real microarrays and comparing to different algorithmic approaches such as Bimax, CC, OPSM, Plaid and xMotifs. Conclusions: SBM shows several advantages such as the ability to recognize more complex coherence patterns such as shifting, scaling and inversion and the capability to selectively marginalize genes and conditions depending on the statistical significance.
