One of these situations is the automatic learning of a network structure, for example, a Bayesian Network structure (BN) starting from a dataset. Searching in the space of structures is often unmanageable, especially if the number of variables is high. Popular heuristic approaches, like Cooper and Herskovits's K2 algorithm, depend on a given ordering of variables. Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) are a new paradigm for Evolutionary Computation that have been used as a search engine in the BN structure learning problem. In this paper, we will use two different EDAs to obtain not the best structure, but the optimal ordering of variables for the K2 algorithm: UMDA and MIMIC, both of them in discrete and continuous domains. We will also check whether the individual representation and its relation to the corresponding ordering play important roles, and whether MIMIC outperforms the results of UMDA.",

When applied to constrained optimization problems, most evolutionary algorithms use special techniques for handling invalid solutions. This paper presents PolyEDA, a new EDA approach that is able to directly consider linear inequality constraints by using Gibbs sampling. Gibbs sampling allows us to sample new individuals inside the boundaries of the polyhedral search space described using a set of linear inequality constraints by iteratively constructing a density approximation that lies entirely inside the polyhedron. Gibbs sampling prevents the creation of infeasible solutions. Thus, no additional techniques for handling infeasible solutions are needed in PolyEDA. Due to its ability to consider linear inequality constraints, PolyEDA can be used for highly constrained optimization problems, where even the generation of valid solutions is a non-trivial task. Results for different variants of a constrained Rosenbrock problem show a higher performance of PolyEDA in comparison to a standard EDA using rejection sampling.",

The idea is to employ two kinds of probability vector (PV): one each for resident and immigrant candidates. The distribution of crossbred individuals (that virtually exist on both kinds of PV) is then utilized by a new type of crossover, the PV-wise crossover. A multiple-deme parallel population-based incremental learning ((PBIL)-B-2) scheme is proposed as an application. The (PBIL)-B-2 scheme closely follows the proposed framework that includes a new learning strategy (i.e., PV update rule). Experimental results show that (PBIL)-B-2 generally exhibits solutions that compare favourably with those computed by an existing PGA with multiple demes, thereby supporting the validity of the proposed framework for designing multiple-deme PEDAs.",

In order to assess the accuracy level of the proposed approach, the naive-Bayes classification algorithm is employed in a wrapper form. Promising results are achieved, in addition to a considerable reduction in the number of genes.

We introduce the heuristic functions and the limit models of these two algorithms and analyze stability of these limit models. It is shown that the limit model of UMDA can be trapped at any local optimal solution for some initial probability models. However, degenerate probability density functions (pdfs) at some local optimal solutions are unstable in the limit model of FDA. In particular, the degenerate pdf at the global optimal solution is the unique asymptotically stable point in the limit model of FDA for the optimization of an additively decomposable function. Our results suggest that using higher order statistics could improve the chance of finding the global optimal solution.",

Other advantages of feature selection include the ability of the classification system to attain good or even better solutions using a restricted subset of features, and a faster classification. Thus, robust methods for fast feature selection are of key importance in extracting knowledge from complex biological data.|Results: In this paper we present a novel method for feature subset selection applied to splice site prediction, based on estimation of distribution algorithms, a more general framework of genetic algorithms. From the estimated distribution of the algorithm, a feature ranking is derived. Afterwards this ranking is used to iteratively discard features. We apply this technique to the problem of splice site prediction, and show how it can be used to gain insight into the underlying biological process of splicing.|Conclusion: We show that this technique proves to be more robust than the traditional use of estimation of distribution algorithms for feature selection: instead of returning a single best subset of features ( as they normally do) this method provides a dynamical view of the feature selection process, like the traditional sequential wrapper methods. However, the method is faster than the traditional techniques, and scales better to datasets described by a large number of features.",

Recently, a series of advanced techniques in evolutionary computations have been proposed to solve such GA-difficult problems. As one of these techniques, linkage identification checks nonlinearity caused by bit-wise perturbations for pairs of loci. Another advanced technique is Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) which estimates probabilistic distribution for populations, and the Bayesian Optimization Algorithm (BOA) is the most sophisticated method in the EDAs. These methods can solve GA-difficult problem, paying additional computational cost. Therefore, parallel versions of these techniques, parallel GA based on linkage identification and parallel BOA, are studied to reduce computation time. In this paper, we compare performance of the parallel GA based on linkage identification with that of parallel BOA in actual parallel computing environment From the results, we consider relations between performance of the algorithms and the characteristics of the problems to be solved.

One of these situations is the automatic learning of a network structure, for example, a Bayesian Network structure (BN) starting from a dataset. Searching in the space of structures is often unmanageable, especially if the number of variables is high. Popular heuristic approaches, like Cooper and Herskovits's K2 algorithm, depend on a given ordering of variables. Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) are a new paradigm for Evolutionary Computation that have been used as a search engine in the BN structure learning problem. In this paper, we will use two different EDAs to obtain not the best structure, but the optimal ordering of variables for the K2 algorithm: UMDA and MIMIC, both of them in discrete and continuous domains. We will also check whether the individual representation and its relation to the corresponding ordering play important roles, and whether MIMIC outperforms the results of UMDA.",

When applied to constrained optimization problems, most evolutionary algorithms use special techniques for handling invalid solutions. This paper presents PolyEDA, a new EDA approach that is able to directly consider linear inequality constraints by using Gibbs sampling. Gibbs sampling allows us to sample new individuals inside the boundaries of the polyhedral search space described using a set of linear inequality constraints by iteratively constructing a density approximation that lies entirely inside the polyhedron. Gibbs sampling prevents the creation of infeasible solutions. Thus, no additional techniques for handling infeasible solutions are needed in PolyEDA. Due to its ability to consider linear inequality constraints, PolyEDA can be used for highly constrained optimization problems, where even the generation of valid solutions is a non-trivial task. Results for different variants of a constrained Rosenbrock problem show a higher performance of PolyEDA in comparison to a standard EDA using rejection sampling.",

The distribution of crossbred individuals (that virtually exist on both kinds of PV) is then utilized by a new type of crossover, the PV-wise crossover. A multiple-deme parallel population-based incremental learning ((PBIL)-B-2) scheme is proposed as an application. The (PBIL)-B-2 scheme closely follows the proposed framework that includes a new learning strategy (i.e., PV update rule).

We introduce the heuristic functions and the limit models of these two algorithms and analyze stability of these limit models. It is shown that the limit model of UMDA can be trapped at any local optimal solution for some initial probability models. However, degenerate probability density functions (pdfs) at some local optimal solutions are unstable in the limit model of FDA. In particular, the degenerate pdf at the global optimal solution is the unique asymptotically stable point in the limit model of FDA for the optimization of an additively decomposable function. Our results suggest that using higher order statistics could improve the chance of finding the global optimal solution.",

Other advantages of feature selection include the ability of the classification system to attain good or even better solutions using a restricted subset of features, and a faster classification. Thus, robust methods for fast feature selection are of key importance in extracting knowledge from complex biological data.|Results: In this paper we present a novel method for feature subset selection applied to splice site prediction, based on estimation of distribution algorithms, a more general framework of genetic algorithms. From the estimated distribution of the algorithm, a feature ranking is derived. Afterwards this ranking is used to iteratively discard features. We apply this technique to the problem of splice site prediction, and show how it can be used to gain insight into the underlying biological process of splicing.|Conclusion: We show that this technique proves to be more robust than the traditional use of estimation of distribution algorithms for feature selection: instead of returning a single best subset of features ( as they normally do) this method provides a dynamical view of the feature selection process, like the traditional sequential wrapper methods. However, the method is faster than the traditional techniques, and scales better to datasets described by a large number of features.",

Recently, a series of advanced techniques in evolutionary computations have been proposed to solve such GA-difficult problems. As one of these techniques, linkage identification checks nonlinearity caused by bit-wise perturbations for pairs of loci. Another advanced technique is Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) which estimates probabilistic distribution for populations, and the Bayesian Optimization Algorithm (BOA) is the most sophisticated method in the EDAs. These methods can solve GA-difficult problem, paying additional computational cost. Therefore, parallel versions of these techniques, parallel GA based on linkage identification and parallel BOA, are studied to reduce computation time. In this paper, we compare performance of the parallel GA based on linkage identification with that of parallel BOA in actual parallel computing environment From the results, we consider relations between performance of the algorithms and the characteristics of the problems to be solved.

When applied to constrained optimization problems, most evolutionary algorithms use special techniques for handling invalid solutions.

Gibbs sampling allows us to sample new individuals inside the boundaries of the polyhedral search space described using a set of linear inequality constraints by iteratively constructing a density approximation that lies entirely inside the polyhedron. Gibbs sampling prevents the creation of infeasible solutions. Thus, no additional techniques for handling infeasible solutions are needed in PolyEDA. Due to its ability to consider linear inequality constraints, PolyEDA can be used for highly constrained optimization problems, where even the generation of valid solutions is a non-trivial task. Results for different variants of a constrained Rosenbrock problem show a higher performance of PolyEDA in comparison to a standard EDA using rejection sampling.",

The distribution of crossbred individuals (that virtually exist on both kinds of PV) is then utilized by a new type of crossover, the PV-wise crossover. A multiple-deme parallel population-based incremental learning ((PBIL)-B-2) scheme is proposed as an application. The (PBIL)-B-2 scheme closely follows the proposed framework that includes a new learning strategy (i.e., PV update rule).

We introduce the heuristic functions and the limit models of these two algorithms and analyze stability of these limit models. It is shown that the limit model of UMDA can be trapped at any local optimal solution for some initial probability models. However, degenerate probability density functions (pdfs) at some local optimal solutions are unstable in the limit model of FDA. In particular, the degenerate pdf at the global optimal solution is the unique asymptotically stable point in the limit model of FDA for the optimization of an additively decomposable function.

Other advantages of feature selection include the ability of the classification system to attain good or even better solutions using a restricted subset of features, and a faster classification. Thus, robust methods for fast feature selection are of key importance in extracting knowledge from complex biological data.|Results: In this paper we present a novel method for feature subset selection applied to splice site prediction, based on estimation of distribution algorithms, a more general framework of genetic algorithms. From the estimated distribution of the algorithm, a feature ranking is derived. Afterwards this ranking is used to iteratively discard features. We apply this technique to the problem of splice site prediction, and show how it can be used to gain insight into the underlying biological process of splicing.|Conclusion: We show that this technique proves to be more robust than the traditional use of estimation of distribution algorithms for feature selection: instead of returning a single best subset of features ( as they normally do) this method provides a dynamical view of the feature selection process, like the traditional sequential wrapper methods. However, the method is faster than the traditional techniques, and scales better to datasets described by a large number of features.",

In this paper we propose the usage of naive Bayes and Interval Estimation Naive Bayes (IENB) - a new semi naive Bayes approach - as suitable third generation methods for Protein Secondary Structure Prediction (PSSP).

        "description": "Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are considered robust optimization algorithms which can solve wide-spectrum of difficult problems such as combinatorial optimization problems. Still, there are some GA-difficult problems which cannot ensure tight linkage in encoding strings. In such problems, crossovers cannot perform effectively on loosely encoded strings due to building block disruptions. Recently, a series of advanced techniques in evolutionary computations have been proposed to solve such GA-difficult problems. As one of these techniques, linkage identification checks nonlinearity caused by bit-wise perturbations for pairs of loci. Another advanced technique is Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) which estimates probabilistic distribution for populations, and the Bayesian Optimization Algorithm (BOA) is the most sophisticated method in the EDAs. These methods can solve GA-difficult problem, paying additional computational cost. Therefore, parallel versions of these techniques, parallel GA based on linkage identification and parallel BOA, are studied to reduce computation time. In this paper, we compare performance of the parallel GA based on linkage identification with that of parallel BOA in actual parallel computing environment From the results, we consider relations between performance of the algorithms and the characteristics of the problems to be solved. Finally, we make discussions on the problem domains which algorithm performs more efficiently.",

When applied to constrained optimization problems, most evolutionary algorithms use special techniques for handling invalid solutions. This paper presents PolyEDA, a new EDA approach that is able to directly consider linear inequality constraints by using Gibbs sampling. Gibbs sampling allows us to sample new individuals inside the boundaries of the polyhedral search space described using a set of linear inequality constraints by iteratively constructing a density approximation that lies entirely inside the polyhedron. Gibbs sampling prevents the creation of infeasible solutions. Thus, no additional techniques for handling infeasible solutions are needed in PolyEDA. Due to its ability to consider linear inequality constraints, PolyEDA can be used for highly constrained optimization problems, where even the generation of valid solutions is a non-trivial task. Results for different variants of a constrained Rosenbrock problem show a higher performance of PolyEDA in comparison to a standard EDA using rejection sampling.",

The idea is to employ two kinds of probability vector (PV): one each for resident and immigrant candidates. The distribution of crossbred individuals (that virtually exist on both kinds of PV) is then utilized by a new type of crossover, the PV-wise crossover. A multiple-deme parallel population-based incremental learning ((PBIL)-B-2) scheme is proposed as an application. The (PBIL)-B-2 scheme closely follows the proposed framework that includes a new learning strategy (i.e., PV update rule). Experimental results show that (PBIL)-B-2 generally exhibits solutions that compare favourably with those computed by an existing PGA with multiple demes, thereby supporting the validity of the proposed framework for designing multiple-deme PEDAs.",

We introduce the heuristic functions and the limit models of these two algorithms and analyze stability of these limit models. It is shown that the limit model of UMDA can be trapped at any local optimal solution for some initial probability models. However, degenerate probability density functions (pdfs) at some local optimal solutions are unstable in the limit model of FDA. In particular, the degenerate pdf at the global optimal solution is the unique asymptotically stable point in the limit model of FDA for the optimization of an additively decomposable function.

Other advantages of feature selection include the ability of the classification system to attain good or even better solutions using a restricted subset of features, and a faster classification. Thus, robust methods for fast feature selection are of key importance in extracting knowledge from complex biological data.|Results: In this paper we present a novel method for feature subset selection applied to splice site prediction, based on estimation of distribution algorithms, a more general framework of genetic algorithms. From the estimated distribution of the algorithm, a feature ranking is derived. Afterwards this ranking is used to iteratively discard features. We apply this technique to the problem of splice site prediction, and show how it can be used to gain insight into the underlying biological process of splicing.|Conclusion: We show that this technique proves to be more robust than the traditional use of estimation of distribution algorithms for feature selection: instead of returning a single best subset of features ( as they normally do) this method provides a dynamical view of the feature selection process, like the traditional sequential wrapper methods. However, the method is faster than the traditional techniques, and scales better to datasets described by a large number of features.",

In this paper we propose the usage of naive Bayes and Interval Estimation Naive Bayes (IENB) - a new semi naive Bayes approach - as suitable third generation methods for Protein Secondary Structure Prediction (PSSP).

A web farm is a group of replicated HTTP servers that reply web requests forwarded by a single point of access to the service. To deal with this task the point of access executes a load balancing algorithm to distribute web request among the group of servers. The present algorithms provides a short-term dynamic configuration for this operation, but some corrective actions (granting different session priorities or distributed WAN forwarding) cannot be achieved without a long-term estimation of the future web load.

        "authors": "Shakya, SK, McCall, JAW and Brown, DF",
        "description": "In this paper, we propose a new technique to update a probability vector [1] for Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDA)[15]. We present a novel algorithm belonging to the general class of EDA which we call Distribution Estimation using Markov Random Fields (DEUM). In common with other EDAs, DEUM uses a population of chromosomes to build a probabilistic model of good solutions. The model is then used to update the probability vector which is sampled to generate further populations, replacing the function of recombinative operators in a traditional genetic algorithm. DEUM uses Markov Random Field (MRF) modelling [3] to estimate the probabilistic relationship between allele values and fitness and iteratively refine a probability vector to generate better solutions. We present experimental results on the performance of DEUM and make comparisons with other algorithms in the Univariate EDA class. Our experiments show that MRF modelling provides a significant advantage over other approaches on problems where univariate algorithms are typically used.",

        "description": "Improving image quality is the backbone of highly competitive display industry. Contemporary video processing system design is a challenging optimization problem. Generally, several video algorithms must be sequentially applied to real-time video data. Overall image quality depends on the nonlinear interactions between multiple design parameters: variable settings for each module (algorithm), the amount of data being transferred in the video processing chain as well as the order of the cascading modules. Unfortunately, no systematic techniques are currently available to configure the video chain without lengthy trial and error process. We propose a rapid and reliable method for optimization of composite video processing systems based on genetic algorithm coupled with local search heuristics. Video system configuration is evolved toward the best image quality, driven by an objective video quality metric. We analyze several local search approaches, including hill-climbing, simplex and estimation-of-distribution algorithms. Experimental study demonstrates superior performance of memetic strategies over the conventional genetic algorithm. We obtain novel and practical video chain solutions that are typically not attainable by regular design process.",

        "authors": "Murao, N, Munetomo, M and Akama, K",
        "description": "Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are considered robust optimization algorithms which can solve wide-spectrum of difficult problems such as combinatorial optimization problems. Still, there are some GA-difficult problems which cannot ensure tight linkage in encoding strings. In such problems, crossovers cannot perform effectively on loosely encoded strings due to building block disruptions. Recently, a series of advanced techniques in evolutionary computations have been proposed to solve such GA-difficult problems. As one of these techniques, linkage identification checks nonlinearity caused by bit-wise perturbations for pairs of loci. Another advanced technique is Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) which estimates probabilistic distribution for populations, and the Bayesian Optimization Algorithm (BOA) is the most sophisticated method in the EDAs. These methods can solve GA-difficult problem, paying additional computational cost. Therefore, parallel versions of these techniques, parallel GA based on linkage identification and parallel BOA, are studied to reduce computation time. In this paper, we compare performance of the parallel GA based on linkage identification with that of parallel BOA in actual parallel computing environment From the results, we consider relations between performance of the algorithms and the characteristics of the problems to be solved. Finally, we make discussions on the problem domains which algorithm performs more efficiently.",

        "description": "This paper describes a continuous estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) to solve decomposable, real-valued optimization problems quickly, accurately, and reliably. This is the real-coded Bayesian optimization algorithm (rBOA). The objective is to bring the strength of (discrete) BOA to bear upon the area of real-valued optimization. That is, the rBOA must properly decompose a problem, efficiently fit each subproblem, and effectively exploit the results so that correct linkage learning even on nonlinearity and probabilistic building-block crossover (PBBC) are performed for real-valued multivariate variables. The idea is to perform a Bayesian factorization of a mixture of probability distributions, find maximal connected subgraphs (i.e. substructures) of the Bayesian factorization graph (i.e., the structure of a probabilistic model), independently fit each substructure by a mixture distribution estimated from clustering results in the corresponding partial-string space (i.e., subspace, subproblem), and draw the offspring by an independent subspace-based sampling. Experimental results show that the rBOA finds, with a sublinear scale-up behavior for decomposable problems, a solution that is superior in quality to that found by a mixed iterative density-estimation evolutionary algorithm (mIDEA) as the problem size grows. Moreover, the rBOA generally outperforms the mIDEA on well-known benchmarks for real-valued optimization.",

To adapt evolutionary algorithms to the structure of a multi-objective optimization problem, either an adaptive representation or adaptive genetic operators should be employed. In this paper, we suggest an estimation of distribution algorithm for solving multi-objective optimization, which is able to adjust its reproduction process to the problem structure. For this purpose, a new algorithm called Voronoi-based Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (VEDA) is proposed. In VEDA, a Voronoi diagram is used to construct stochastic models, based on which new offspring will be generated. Empirical comparisons of the VEDA with other estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) and the popular NSGA-II algorithm are carried out. In addition, representation of Pareto-optimal solutions using a mathematical model rather than a solution set is also discussed.",

Like other EAs, EDA/L maintains and improves a population of solutions in the feasible region. Initial candidate solutions are generated by uniform design, these solutions evenly scatter over the feasible solution region. To generate a new population, a marginal histogram model is built based on the global statistical information extracted from the current population and then new solutions are sampled from the model thus built. The incomplete simplex method applies to every new solution generated by uniform design or sampled from the histogram model. Unconstrained optimization by diagonal quadratic approximation applies to several selected resultant solutions of the incomplete simplex method at each generation. We study the effectiveness of main components of EDA/L. The experimental results demonstrate that EDA/L is better than four other recent EAs in terms of the solution quality and the computational cost.",
