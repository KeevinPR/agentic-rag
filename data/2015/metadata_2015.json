        "description": "We propose CEDA, a Copula-based Estimation of Distribution Algorithm, to increase the size, achieve high diversity and convergence of optimal solutions for a multiobjective optimization problem. The algorithm exploits the statistical properties of Copulas to produce new solutions from the existing ones through the estimation of their distribution. CEDA starts by taking initial solutions provided by any MOEA (Multi Objective Evolutionary Algorithm), construct Copulas to estimate their distribution, and uses the constructed Copulas to generate new solutions. This design saves CEDA the need of running an MOEA every time alternative solutions are requested by a Decision Maker when the found solutions are not satisfactory. CEDA was tested on a set of benchmark problems traditionally used by the community, namely UF1, UF2, ..., UF10 and CF1, CF2, ..., CF10. CEDA used along with SPEA2 and NSGA2 as two examples of MOEA thus resulting in two variants CEDA-SPEA2 and CEDA-NSGA2 and compare them with SPEA2 and NSGA2. The results of The experiments show that, with both variants of CEDA, new solutions can be generated in a significantly smaller without compromising quality compared to those found SPEA2 and NSGA2.",

        "description": "In an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA), global population distribution is modeled by a probabilistic model, from which new trial solutions are sampled, whereas individual location information is not directly and fully exploited. In this paper, we suggest to combine an EDA with cheap and expensive local search (LS) methods for making use of both global statistical information and individual location information. In our approach, part of a new solution is sampled from a modified univariate histogram probabilistic model and the rest is generated by refining a parent solution through a cheap LS method that does not need any function evaluation. When the population has converged, an expensive LS method is applied to improve a promising solution found so far. Controlled experiments have been carried out to investigate the effects of the algorithm components and the control parameters, the scalability on the number of variables, and the running time. The proposed algorithm has been compared with two state-of-the-art algorithms on two test suites of 27 test instances. Experimental results have shown that, for simple test instances, our algorithm can produce better or similar solutions but with faster convergence speed than the compared methods and for some complicated test instances it can find better solutions.",

        "description": "Most researchers employed common functional models when managing scheduling problems with controllable processing times. However, in many complicated manufacturing systems with a high diversity of jobs, these functional resource models fail to reflect their specific characteristics. To fulfill these requirements, we apply a more general model, the discrete model. Traditional functional models can be viewed as special cases of such model. In this paper, the discrete model is implemented on a problem of minimizing the weighted resource allocation subject to a common deadline on a single machine. By reducing the problem to a partition problem, we demonstrate that it is NP-complete, which addresses the difficult issue of the guarantee of both the solution quality and time cost. In order to tackle the problem, we develop an estimation of distribution algorithm based on an approximation of the Boltzmann distribution. The approximation strategy represents a tradeoff between complexity and solution accuracy. The results of the experiments conducted on benchmarks show that, compared with other alternative approaches, the proposed algorithm has competitive behavior, obtaining 74 best solutions out of 90 instances.",

In this paper, a two-stage simulation-based hybrid estimation of distribution algorithm (TSSB-HEDA) is presented to schedule the permutation flowshop under stochastic processing times. To deal with processing time uncertainty, TSSB-HEDA evaluates candidate solutions using a novel two-stage simulation model (TSSM). This model first adopts the regression-based meta-modelling technique to determine a number of promising candidate solutions with less computation cost, and then uses a more accurate but time-consuming simulator to evaluate the performance of these selected ones. In addition, to avoid getting trapped into premature convergence, TSSB-HEDA employs both the probabilistic model of EDA and genetic operators of genetic algorithm (GA) to generate the offspring individuals. Enlightened by the weight training process of neural networks, a self-adaptive learning mechanism (SALM) is employed to dynamically adjust the ratio of offspring individuals generated by the probabilistic model. Computational experiments on Taillard's benchmarks show that TSSB-HEDA is competitive in terms of both solution quality and computational performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The semiconductor final testing scheduling problem (SFTSP) is of great significance to the efficiency of the semiconductor companies. To find satisfactory solutions within reasonable computational time, the intelligent manufacturing scheduling based on the meta-heuristic methods has become a common approach. In this paper, a hybrid estimation of distribution algorithm (HEDA) is proposed to solve the SFTSP. First, novel encoding and decoding methods are proposed to map from the solution space to the schedule space effectively. Second, a probability model that describes the distribution of the solution space is built to generate the new individuals of the population. Third, a mechanism is used to update the parameters of the probability model with the superior solutions at every generation. Furthermore, to enhance the exploitation ability of the algorithm, a local search procedure is hybridized to find neighbor solutions of the promising individuals obtained by sampling the probability model. In addition, the influence of parameters is investigated based on Taguchi method of design-of-experiment, and a set of suitable parameters is suggested. Finally, numerical simulation based on some benchmark instances is carried out. The comparisons between the HEDA and some existing algorithms demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HEDA in solving the SFTSP.",

It is one of well-defined open issues which have attracted many research efforts.

Further, the performance of developed method is validated by applying on multicast routing optimization. The developed method randomly initializes n trees which contain the source node and the destination nodes. And some individuals select the crossover operation randomly to add the population diversity and avoid the algorithm premature convergence. The algorithm constructs a probabilistic model according to the selected elites, which is capable of estimating the probability distribution of the solution. The probabilistic model is updated according to the new population. New trees are generated based on the probabilistic model. This process iterated until designated termination criteria are met. The improved EDA algorithm gradually evolves trees to obtain a better solution. Simulation validations suggest that the developed method leads to better performance.

Compared with the static algorithms, dynamic scheduling algorithms can better fulfill the requirements in real situations. Considering that both flexibility and fuzzy processing time are common in reality, this paper focuses on the dynamic flexible job-shop scheduling problem with fuzzy processing time (DfFJSP). By adopting a series of transforming procedures, the original DfFJSP is simplified as a traditional static fuzzy flexible job-shop problem, which is more suitable to take advantage of the existing algorithms. In this paper, estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) is brought into address the post-transforming problem. An improved EDA is developed through making use of several elements omitted in original EDA, including the historical-optimal solution and the standardized solution vectors. The improved algorithm is named as fast estimation of distribution algorithm (fEDA) since it performs better in convergence speed and computation precision, compared with the original EDA. To sum up, the ingenious transformation and the effective fEDA algorithm provide an efficient and practical way to tackle the dynamic flexible fuzzy job-shop scheduling problem.

Traditionally, RECO is modeled as a single optimization problem by using a certain scalar method. Few works have been done for solving multi-objective RECO (MO-RECO) problems. In this paper, a hybrid multi-objective optimization approach named MO-PSO-EDA which combines the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and the estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) is developed for solving the MO-RECO problem. MO-PSO-EDA divides the particle population into several sub-populations and builds probability models for each of them. Based on the probability model, each sub-population reproduces new offspring by using PSO based and EDA methods. In the PSO based method, a novel global best position selection method is designed. With the help of the EDA based reproduction, the algorithm can lean linkage between decision variables and hence have a good capability of solving complex multi-objective optimization problems, such as the MO-RECO problem. Experimental studies on six benchmark problems and two typical multi-objective flood control operation problems of Ankang reservoir have indicated that the proposed MO-PSO-EDA performs as well as or superior to the other three competitive multi-objective optimization algorithms.

One of the issues that can affect the performance of these algorithms is the uncertainty in the quality of the solutions which is usually represented with the noise in the objective values. Therefore, handling noisy objectives in evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithms becomes very important and is gaining more attention in recent years. In this paper we present -degree Pareto dominance relation for ordering the solutions in multi-objective optimization when the values of the objective functions are given as intervals. Based on this dominance relation, we propose an adaptation of the non-dominated sorting algorithm for ranking the solutions. This ranking method is then used in a standard multi-objective evolutionary algorithm and a recently proposed novel multi-objective estimation of distribution algorithm based on joint variable-objective probabilistic modeling, and applied to a set of multi-objective problems with different levels of independent noise. The experimental results show that the use of the proposed method for solution ranking allows to approximate Pareto sets which are considerably better than those obtained when using the dominance probability-based ranking method, which is one of the main methods for noise handling in multi-objective optimization.",

New individuals are generated in the promising search areas by sampling and updating the hybrid probability model.

Finally, numerical results and the comparisons to other algorithms are provided to show the effectiveness of the PBEDA in terms of quantity and quality of the obtained solutions.

        "description": "The maximum balanced biclique problem (MBBP), an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, has been attracting more attention in recent years. Existing node-deletion-based algorithms usually fail to find high-quality solutions due to their easy stagnation in local optima, especially when the scale of the problem grows large. In this paper, a new algorithm for the MBBP, evolutionary algorithm with structure mutation (EA/SM), is proposed. In the EA/SM framework, local search complemented with a repair-assisted restart process is adopted. A new mutation operator, SM, is proposed to enhance the exploration during the local search process. The SM can change the structure of solutions dynamically while keeping their size (fitness) and the feasibility unchanged. It implements a kind of large mutation in the structure space of MBBP to help the algorithm escape from local optima. An MBBP-specific local search operator is designed to improve the quality of solutions efficiently; besides, a new repair-assisted restart process is introduced, in which the Marchiori's heuristic repair is modified to repair every new solution reinitialized by an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA)-like process. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a large set of benchmark graphs with various scales and densities. Experimental results show that: 1) EA/SM produces significantly better results than the state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms; 2) it also outperforms a repair-based EDA and a repair-based genetic algorithm on all benchmark graphs; and 3) the advantages of EA/SM are mainly due to the introduction of the new SM operator and the new repair-assisted restart process.",

        "description": "The artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is a competitive stochastic population-based optimization algorithm. However, the ABC algorithm does not use the social information and lacks the knowledge of the problem structure, which leads to insufficiency in both convergent speed and searching precision. Archimedean copula estimation of distribution algorithm (ACEDA) is a relatively simple, time-economic and multivariate correlated EDA. This paper proposes a novel hybrid algorithm based on the ABC algorithm and ACEDA called Archimedean copula estimation of distribution based on the artificial bee colony (ACABC) algorithm. The hybrid algorithm utilizes ACEDA to estimate the distribution model and then uses the information to help artificial bees to search more efficiently in the search space. Six benchmark functions are introduced to assess the performance of the ACABC algorithm on numerical function optimization. Experimental results show that the ACABC algorithm converges much faster with greater precision compared with the ABC algorithm, ACEDA and the global best (gbest)-guided ABC (GABC) algorithm in most of the experiments.",

        "description": "Inspired by biological evolution, a plethora of algorithms with evolutionary features have been proposed. These algorithms have strengths in certain aspects, thus yielding better optimization performance in a particular problem. However, in a wide range of problems, none of them are superior to one another. Synergetic combination of these algorithms is one of the potential ways to ameliorate their search ability. Based on this idea, this paper proposes an adaptive memetic computing as the synergy of a genetic algorithm, differential evolution, and estimation of distribution algorithm. The ratio of the number of fitter solutions produced by the algorithms in a generation defines their adaptability features in the next generation. Subsequently, a subset of solutions undergoes local search using the evolutionary gradient search algorithm. This memetic technique is then implemented in two prominent frameworks of multiobjective optimization: the domination- and decomposition-based frameworks. The performance of the adaptive memetic algorithms is validated in a wide range of test problems with different characteristics and difficulties.",

        "description": "A novel self-adaptive variable-size multi-objective differential evolution algorithm is presented to find the best reconfiguration of existing on-orbit satellites for some particular targets on the ground when an emergent requirement arises in a short period. The main contribution of this study is that three coverage metrics are designed to assess the performance of the reconfiguration. Proposed algorithm utilizes the idea of fixed-length chromosome encoding scheme combined with expression vector and the modified initialization, mutation, crossover and selection operators to search for optimal reconfiguration structure. Multi-subpopulation diversity initialization is adopted first, then the mutation based on estimation of distribution algorithm and adaptive crossover operators are defined to manipulate variable-length chromosomes, and finally a new selection mechanism is employed to generate well-distributed individuals for the next generation. The proposed algorithm is applied to three characteristically different case studies, with the objective to improve the performance with respect to specified targets by minimizing fuel consumption and maneuver time. The results show that the algorithm can effectively find the approximate Pareto solutions under different topological structures. A comparative analysis demonstrates that the proposed algorithm outperforms two other related multi-objective evolutionary optimization algorithms in terms of quality, convergence and diversity metrics.

        "description": "In view of the stochastic nature of the data in real-world manufacturing systems, it is crucial to develop effective algorithms to solve the scheduling problems with uncertainty. In this paper, an order-based estimation of distribution algorithm (OEDA) is proposed to solve the hybrid flow-shop scheduling problem (HFSP) with stochastic processing times. Considering the effectiveness and robustness of a schedule, it aims to minimise the makespan of the initial scenario as well as the deviation of all results of the stochastic scenarios and the initial one. To be specific, a bi-objective function is used to evaluate the individuals of the population, and a probability model is designed to describe the probability distribution of the solution space. Meanwhile, optimal computing budget allocation (OCBA) technique is employed to provide a reliable identification to the good solutions among the population. A mechanism is also presented to update the probability model with the superior individuals that are identified by the OCBA. The new individuals are generated by sampling the probability model to track the area with promising solutions. In addition, the influence of parameter setting is investigated based on Taguchi method of design-of-experiment (DOE), and a suitable parameter setting is suggested. Extensive numerical testing results and comparisons with the existing algorithm are provided, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed OEDA.",

In the case of an oil field, the problem of distributing a certain amount of the available gas among a number of wells is formally known as a gas lift allocation problem. In this paper, a multi-objective optimization algorithm, based on the Gaussian Bayesian Networks and the Gaussian kernels, is proposed in order to determine the best injection points, considering multiple objective functions. Firstly, the problem is solved in a similar approach to the previous literature with similar gas lift data and similar function approximation method, to compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with the older ones. Thereafter, an extended problem is discussed, with minimizing the water production as a new optimization criterion. The developed multi-objective scheme is capable of handling and optimizing a gas-lift problem with several constraints and conflicting objectives such as controlling the gas usage and increasing the oil production, whereas in the conventional single-objective optimizations, any alteration in the constraints demands a new optimization process and often there is no place for considering an additional objective in the gas-lift allocation problem. The results obtained by the proposed optimization algorithm significantly overcame those reported in the previous similar literature. For a single-objective fifty-six well problem, the results exhibited 16.24% improvement in the total oil production. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

Multi-objective estimation of distribution algorithm based on decomposition (MEDA/D) evolves a probability vector for each sub-problem to guide the search instead of using crossover operator. However, since the number of the weight vectors in the neighborhood of each weight vector is relatively small and MEDA/D does not provide a way to maintain diversity, the performance of MEDA/D is limited. To overcome the drawbacks of MEDA/D, we proposed a new reproduction operator. This operator could promote diversity. We introduced it into MOEA/D framework and the new algorithm is called s-MEDA/D. We also prove that the parameter newly introduced has physical significance and the reproduction operator is not susceptible to the scale of the problem.

        "description": "Topological shape optimization refers to the problem of finding the optimal shape of a mechanical structure by using a process for removing or inserting new holes or parts, it is to say, using a process which produces topological changes. This article introduces a method for automated topological optimization via an Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) with a suitable representation of the optimization variables. The optimum structure is such with the minimum weight which does not exceed a maximum von Mises stress and displacement. The contributions of this proposal resides in the definition of a candidate solution and the optimization method. The candidate solution representation is independent of the finer discretization used for analyzing candidate structures using the finite element method. Given a domain Omega, which corresponds to the physical space where candidate structures reside, a vector phi = [phi(1), phi(2), ..., phi(m)] is used to define a smooth function (phi) over cap (x, y) on Omega. If (phi) over cap (x, y) is less than 0.5, such region does not have material, otherwise, it has. The smooth function phi(x, y) provides the advantage of having continuous regions with or without material while it depends on few optimization parameters 0, in addition, we can define an arbitrary number of parts or gaps as thinner or larger as needed. The EDA benefits from this representation, sampling random arbitrary structures and using probabilistic learning to determine whether a region must have material. The EDA is a global optimizer which can propose different topologies without the need of a priori knowledge neither initial solutions. In addition it uses a probabilistic model which smoothly evolve through generations. In consequence, at the beginning of the optimization process it arbitrarily proposes topologically different structures, while at the convergence phase it performs similar to a local search algorithm. The EDA uses few parameters which can be set in a straight forward manner. We report several study cases from the specialized literature, showing that our proposal outperforms reported results from up-to-date well performed algorithms.",

        "description": "This paper proposes a probabilistic evolutionary computing algorithm for robots to learn motion patterns. This algorithm is inspired from Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDA). The distribution of chromosomes (not the genes), which have higher fitness values in the configuration space, is estimated in a configuration space. A modified Probabilistic Rapidly-growing Random Tree (PRRT)-Connect algorithm is used for searching the configuration space to generate chromosomes which are represented as paths from the starting point to the goal point. Mutation is defined as searching with certain probability outside of the current distribution area (obstacle-free area). This algorithm is applied for robotic learning of motion trajectories through imitation. Simulation and practical experimental results are given in this paper to verify the effectiveness of this algorithm. The major contribution of this paper is proposing an extension of current EDAs, which could be applied for rapid robotic imitation learning.",

TTSP is a complex combination optimization problem and includes two sub-problems. They are test task sequencing and test scheme combination. According to the characteristic of TTSP, a non-integrated algorithm based on estimation of distribution algorithm and Tabu Search (EDA-TS) is proposed in this paper. EDA focuses on solving test task sequencing in global searching, and TS emphasizes on solving test scheme combination in local searching. In addition, we give a mathematical model for TTSP. We prove that TTSP is an NP-hard by using traveling salesman problem (TSP) based on the mathematical model. The statistical results of single objective TTSP suggest that our approach has a stronger searching ability and good convergence compared with other three popular algorithms. The experiments of the multi-objectives TTSP also illustrate that EDA-TS has a strong searching ability and can maintain a diversity of solutions.",

Thus, this paper presents the contribution that an evolutionary algorithm effectively finds good feasible solutions without evolutionary stagnation because an unconstrained space consists only of feasible solutions. However, our technique searches mapping points only on the part of constrained space because it cannot transform the constrained space to fully unconstrained space. Therefore, we expand such a space consisting of various mapping points by exchanging trigonometrical functions on EDA (Estimation of Distribution Algorithm).

        "description": "This paper introduces a new Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) based on the multivariate Boltzmann distribution. In this work, the design variables and the energy function of the Boltzmann distribution are continuous. Note that since the population has finite size, it can only approximate a continuous Boltzmann distribution with some error. In order to tackle this issue, the parameter estimators for the mean vector and covariance matrix of a Multivariate Normal Density that approximate the Boltzmann density, are derived by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The algorithm introduced here uses one energy function for the mean estimator and another for the covariance matrix estimator. The first function places the probability mass around the most promising regions by assigning larger weights to individuals with higher fitness. However, the second function orients the covariance matrix along improving directions by assigning larger weights to individuals with lower fitness. Our proposal combines the conveniences of linear weights with a simple annealing schedule to regulate the exploration and exploitation of the search process. The resulting algorithm is named the Boltzmann Estimation of Multivariate Normal Algorithm (BEMNA). By applying the developed formulae the BEMNA is capable of adapting the structure of a density model to the promisory search directions. BEMNA is tested with a benchmark of 16 functions and contrasted with the AMaLGaM algorithm, a state of the art EDA. Statistical tests of the experimental data show the competitiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

Nevertheless, employing Molecular Dynamics trajectories in virtual screening of large repositories is a very costly procedure, which ultimately may become unfeasible. Data clustering have been applied in this context with the goal of reducing the overall computational cost in order to make this task feasible. In this paper, we develop a novel estimation of distribution algorithm called Clus-EDA for clustering entire trajectories using structural features from the substrate-binding cavity of the protein receptor. This novel approach is capable of reducing the original trajectory to about 4% of its original size whilst keeping all relevant information for the analysis of receptor-ligand binding. The resulting partition generated by the estimation of distribution algorithm is further validated by analyzing the interactions between 20 ligands and a Fully-Flexible Receptor model containing a 20 ns Molecular Dynamics simulation trajectory. Results show that Clus-EDA is capable of outperforming traditional clustering algorithms such as k-means and hierarchical clustering by providing the smallest variance of the free energy of binding within the conformations in each cluster.",

An absorption band (3.08-6.00 GHZ) below dB formed with two strong absorption peaks is achieved, compared with the poor absorption performance in pixelated FSS without resistors.

The two sub-populations are generated by sampling the probability models that are updated differently for the global exploration and the local exploitation, respectively.

To well adjust the models for generating promising solutions, the global probability model is updated during the evolution with the superior population and the local probability model is updated with the best solution that has been explored. To further enhance exploitation in the promising region, the insertion operator is used iteratively as the local search procedure. To investigate the influence of parameter setting, numerical study based on the Taguchi method of design-of-experiment is carried out.

Understanding the relationship between EDAs and the space of optimization problems is a fundamental issue for the successful application of this type of algorithms. A step forward in this matter is to create a taxonomy of optimization problems according to the different behaviors that an EDA can exhibit. This paper substantially extends previous work in the proposal of a taxonomy of problems for univariate EDAs, mainly by generalizing those results to EDAs that are able to deal with multivariate dependences among the variables of the problem. Through the definition of an equivalence relation between functions, it is possible to partition the space of problems into equivalence classes in which the algorithm has the same behavior. We provide a sufficient and necessary condition to determine the equivalence between functions. This condition is based on a set of matrices which provides a novel encoding of the relationship between the function and the probabilistic model used by the algorithm. The description of the equivalent functions belonging to a class is studied in depth for EDAs whose probabilistic model is given by a chordal Markov network. Assuming this class of factorization, we unveil the intrinsic connection between the behaviors of EDAs and neighborhood systems defined over the search space. In addition, we carry out numerical simulations that effectively reveal the different behaviors of EDAs for the injective functions defined over the search space (0, 1}(3). Finally, we provide a novel approach to extend the analysis of equivalence classes to non-injective functions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

The goal of this paper is to review three common distances for permutations, Kendall's-, Cayley and Ulam, and compare their performance under MM and GMM EDAs. Moreover, with the aim of predicting the most suitable distance for solving any given permutation problem, we focus our attention on the relation between these distances and the neighbourhood systems in the field of local search optimisation. In this sense, we demonstrate that the performance of the MM and GMM EDAs is strongly correlated with that of multistart local search algorithms when using related neighbourhoods.

        "description": "Topological shape optimization refers to the problem of finding the optimal shape of a mechanical structure by using a process for removing or inserting new holes or parts, it is to say, using a process which produces topological changes. This article introduces a method for automated topological optimization via an Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) with a suitable representation of the optimization variables. The optimum structure is such with the minimum weight which does not exceed a maximum von Mises stress and displacement. The contributions of this proposal resides in the definition of a candidate solution and the optimization method. The candidate solution representation is independent of the finer discretization used for analyzing candidate structures using the finite element method. Given a domain Omega, which corresponds to the physical space where candidate structures reside, a vector phi = [phi(1), phi(2), ..., phi(m)] is used to define a smooth function (phi) over cap (x, y) on Omega. If (phi) over cap (x, y) is less than 0.5, such region does not have material, otherwise, it has. The smooth function phi(x, y) provides the advantage of having continuous regions with or without material while it depends on few optimization parameters 0, in addition, we can define an arbitrary number of parts or gaps as thinner or larger as needed. The EDA benefits from this representation, sampling random arbitrary structures and using probabilistic learning to determine whether a region must have material. The EDA is a global optimizer which can propose different topologies without the need of a priori knowledge neither initial solutions. In addition it uses a probabilistic model which smoothly evolve through generations. In consequence, at the beginning of the optimization process it arbitrarily proposes topologically different structures, while at the convergence phase it performs similar to a local search algorithm. The EDA uses few parameters which can be set in a straight forward manner. We report several study cases from the specialized literature, showing that our proposal outperforms reported results from up-to-date well performed algorithms.",

The main aim of FS is to determine a minimal feature subset from a problem domain while retaining a suitably high accuracy in representing the original set of features. However, the problem of finding optimal reductions is challenging as there is always a trade-off between the extent of reduction and the resulting information loss. This topic has been of particular interest in rough and fuzzy-rough set theory, as these provide a mechanism for defining optimality using only the data itself. Evolutionary methods have been used to try to find rough and fuzzy-rough optimal reductions, but these approaches ignore the fact that not all equally-sized reducts have the same utility for classifiers. This paper presents a novel approach for fuzzy-rough feature selection that uses Estimation of Distribution Algorithms to maintain information about the quality of features, to then obtain a better quality reduct that is more useful in general.",

        "description": "Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) are a successful example of how to use machine learning techniques for designing robust and efficient heuristic search algorithms. Understanding the relationship between EDAs and the space of optimization problems is a fundamental issue for the successful application of this type of algorithms. A step forward in this matter is to create a taxonomy of optimization problems according to the different behaviors that an EDA can exhibit. This paper substantially extends previous work in the proposal of a taxonomy of problems for univariate EDAs, mainly by generalizing those results to EDAs that are able to deal with multivariate dependences among the variables of the problem. Through the definition of an equivalence relation between functions, it is possible to partition the space of problems into equivalence classes in which the algorithm has the same behavior. We provide a sufficient and necessary condition to determine the equivalence between functions. This condition is based on a set of matrices which provides a novel encoding of the relationship between the function and the probabilistic model used by the algorithm. The description of the equivalent functions belonging to a class is studied in depth for EDAs whose probabilistic model is given by a chordal Markov network. Assuming this class of factorization, we unveil the intrinsic connection between the behaviors of EDAs and neighborhood systems defined over the search space. In addition, we carry out numerical simulations that effectively reveal the different behaviors of EDAs for the injective functions defined over the search space (0, 1}(3). Finally, we provide a novel approach to extend the analysis of equivalence classes to non-injective functions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

Recent works, however, have suggested that the performance of these algorithms strongly relies on the distance used under the model. The goal of this paper is to review three common distances for permutations, Kendall's-, Cayley and Ulam, and compare their performance under MM and GMM EDAs. Moreover, with the aim of predicting the most suitable distance for solving any given permutation problem, we focus our attention on the relation between these distances and the neighbourhood systems in the field of local search optimisation. In this sense, we demonstrate that the performance of the MM and GMM EDAs is strongly correlated with that of multistart local search algorithms when using related neighbourhoods. Furthermore, by means of fitness landscape analysis techniques, we show that the suitability of a distance to solve a problem is clearly characterised by the generation of high smoothness fitness landscapes.",

        "description": "Topological shape optimization refers to the problem of finding the optimal shape of a mechanical structure by using a process for removing or inserting new holes or parts, it is to say, using a process which produces topological changes. This article introduces a method for automated topological optimization via an Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) with a suitable representation of the optimization variables. The optimum structure is such with the minimum weight which does not exceed a maximum von Mises stress and displacement. The contributions of this proposal resides in the definition of a candidate solution and the optimization method. The candidate solution representation is independent of the finer discretization used for analyzing candidate structures using the finite element method. Given a domain Omega, which corresponds to the physical space where candidate structures reside, a vector phi = [phi(1), phi(2), ..., phi(m)] is used to define a smooth function (phi) over cap (x, y) on Omega. If (phi) over cap (x, y) is less than 0.5, such region does not have material, otherwise, it has. The smooth function phi(x, y) provides the advantage of having continuous regions with or without material while it depends on few optimization parameters 0, in addition, we can define an arbitrary number of parts or gaps as thinner or larger as needed. The EDA benefits from this representation, sampling random arbitrary structures and using probabilistic learning to determine whether a region must have material. The EDA is a global optimizer which can propose different topologies without the need of a priori knowledge neither initial solutions. In addition it uses a probabilistic model which smoothly evolve through generations. In consequence, at the beginning of the optimization process it arbitrarily proposes topologically different structures, while at the convergence phase it performs similar to a local search algorithm. The EDA uses few parameters which can be set in a straight forward manner. We report several study cases from the specialized literature, showing that our proposal outperforms reported results from up-to-date well performed algorithms.",

        "description": "Due to the explosive growth of stored information worldwide, feature selection (FS) is becoming an increasingly important step, particularly given the abundance of noisy, irrelevant or misleading features. The main aim of FS is to determine a minimal feature subset from a problem domain while retaining a suitably high accuracy in representing the original set of features. However, the problem of finding optimal reductions is challenging as there is always a trade-off between the extent of reduction and the resulting information loss. This topic has been of particular interest in rough and fuzzy-rough set theory, as these provide a mechanism for defining optimality using only the data itself. Evolutionary methods have been used to try to find rough and fuzzy-rough optimal reductions, but these approaches ignore the fact that not all equally-sized reducts have the same utility for classifiers. This paper presents a novel approach for fuzzy-rough feature selection that uses Estimation of Distribution Algorithms to maintain information about the quality of features, to then obtain a better quality reduct that is more useful in general.",

        "description": "Topological shape optimization refers to the problem of finding the optimal shape of a mechanical structure by using a process for removing or inserting new holes or parts, it is to say, using a process which produces topological changes. This article introduces a method for automated topological optimization via an Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) with a suitable representation of the optimization variables. The optimum structure is such with the minimum weight which does not exceed a maximum von Mises stress and displacement. The contributions of this proposal resides in the definition of a candidate solution and the optimization method. The candidate solution representation is independent of the finer discretization used for analyzing candidate structures using the finite element method. Given a domain Omega, which corresponds to the physical space where candidate structures reside, a vector phi = [phi(1), phi(2), ..., phi(m)] is used to define a smooth function (phi) over cap (x, y) on Omega. If (phi) over cap (x, y) is less than 0.5, such region does not have material, otherwise, it has. The smooth function phi(x, y) provides the advantage of having continuous regions with or without material while it depends on few optimization parameters 0, in addition, we can define an arbitrary number of parts or gaps as thinner or larger as needed. The EDA benefits from this representation, sampling random arbitrary structures and using probabilistic learning to determine whether a region must have material. The EDA is a global optimizer which can propose different topologies without the need of a priori knowledge neither initial solutions. In addition it uses a probabilistic model which smoothly evolve through generations. In consequence, at the beginning of the optimization process it arbitrarily proposes topologically different structures, while at the convergence phase it performs similar to a local search algorithm.

In this paper, we propose the pareto optimal block-based EDA using bivariate model for multi-objective flow shop scheduling problem. We apply a bivariate probabilistic model to generate block which have the better diversity. We employ the non-dominated sorting technique to filter the solutions. To check the performance of proposed approach, we test it on the benchmark problems available in OR-library and then we compare it with non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II).

A population of individuals is evolved under genotypic integer strings and a mapping process is utilized to translate from genotype (i.e., integer string) to phenotype (i.e., complete program). To efficiently handle this process, unlike the standard GE that employs a simple modulo function, the probability concept is introduced to context-free grammar, thereby choosing production rules according to assigned probabilities. Moreover, any crossover and mutation are not employed for generating new individuals. Instead, along the lines of estimation of distribution algorithms that perform search using a probabilistic model of superior individuals, a new population is created/evolved from probabilistic relationship between production rules. A comparative study on the standard GE and the proposed GE is conducted; the performance achieved by the both methods is comparable. Also, the experimental results firmly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

        "description": "Metaheuristics assume some kind of coherence between decision and objective spaces. Estimation of Distribution algorithms approach this by constructing an explicit probabilistic model of high fitness solutions, the structure of which is intended to reflect the structure of the problem. In this context, \"structure\" means the dependencies or interactions between problem variables in a probabilistic graphical model. There are many approaches to discovering these dependencies, and existing work has already shown that often these approaches discover \"unnecessary\" elements of structure - that is, elements which are not needed to correctly rank solutions. This work performs an exhaustive analysis of all 2 and 3 bit problems, grouped into classes based on mononotic invariance. It is shown in [1] that each class has a minimal Walsh structure that can be used to solve the problem. We compare the structure discovered by different structure learning approaches to the minimal Walsh structure for each class, with summaries of which interactions are (in) correctly identified. Our analysis reveals a large number of symmetries that may be used to simplify problem solving. We show that negative selection can result in improved coherence between discovered and necessary structure, and conclude with some directions for a general programme of study building on this work.",

        "description": "Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) have been used to solve numerous hard problems. However, their use with in-group optimization problems has not been discussed extensively in the literature. A well-known in-group optimization problem is the multiple traveling salesmen problem (mTSP), which involves simultaneous assignment and sequencing procedures and are shown in different forms. This paper presents a new algorithm, named EDA(MLA), which is based on self-guided genetic algorithm with a minimum loading assignment (MLA) rule. This strategy uses the transformed-based encoding approach instead of direct encoding. The solution space of the proposed method is only n!. We compare the proposed algorithm against the optimal direct encoding technique, the two-part encoding genetic algorithm, and, in experiments on 34 TSP instances drawn from the TSPLIB, find that its solution space is n! ((n-1)(m-1)). The scale of the experiments exceeded that presented in prior studies. The results show that the proposed algorithm was superior to the two-part encoding genetic algorithmin terms of minimizing the total traveling distance. Notably, the proposed algorithm did not cause a longer traveling distance when the number of salesmen was increased from 3 to 10. The results suggest that EDA researchers should employ the MLA rule instead of direct encoding in their proposed algorithms.",

        "description": "Recently, distance-based exponential probability models have demonstrated their validity in the context of estimation of distribution algorithms when solving permutation-based combinatorial optimisation problems. However, despite their successful performance, some of these models are uni-modal, and, therefore, they might not be flexible enough to model the different modalities that may be represented in heterogeneous populations.|In this paper, we address the particular case of the Generalized Mallows models under the Cayley distance, and propose mixtures of these models in the context of estimation of distribution algorithms. In order to evaluate their competitiveness, we considered the quadratic assignment problem as a case of study, and conducted experiments over a set of 90 instances for four different configurations of mixtures. Results reveal that the EDA with mixtures is able to outperform the Generalized Mallows EDA, especially in large instances.",

        "description": "This article presents a review of the application of evolutionary computation methods to solving financial problems. Genetic algorithms, genetic programming, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, learning classifier systems, co-evolutionary approaches, and estimation of distribution algorithms are the techniques considered. The novelty of our approach comes in three different manners: it covers time lapses not included in other review articles, it covers problems not considered by others, and the scope covered by past and new references is compared and analyzed. The results concluded the interest about methods and problems has changed through time. Although, genetic algorithms have remained the most popular approach in the literature. There are combinations of problems and solutions methods which are yet to be investigated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "description": "Component-based computation advocates for building systems by assembling prefabricated self-contained software modules within a formally specified composition model. Furthermore, visual components allow users to perform such assemblage in a friendly graphical board were components are connected visually with virtually no coding needed. Recently, an Evolutionary Computation (EC) suite of components called Goldenberry complying with such premises has been released. In this paper we demonstrate its feasibility in several EC tasks: optimisation of continuous-valued and discrete-valued costs functions using Genetic Algorithms and Estimation of Distribution Algorithms as well as feature selection algorithms and relevance estimation in data mining tasks. We discuss the advantages and weaknesses of the approach and the toolbox, its differences with other existing software tools and proposing avenues of future development.

        "authors": "Tiwari, A, Chang, PC, Kollanoor, NJ",
        "description": "Multi-objective flow shop scheduling plays a key role in real-life scheduling problem which attract the researcher attention. The primary concern is to find the best sequence for flow shop scheduling problem. Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) has gained sufficient attention from the researchers and it provides prominent results as an alternate of traditional evolutionary algorithms. In this paper, we propose the pareto optimal block-based EDA using bivariate model for multi-objective flow shop scheduling problem. We apply a bivariate probabilistic model to generate block which have the better diversity. We employ the non-dominated sorting technique to filter the solutions. To check the performance of proposed approach, we test it on the benchmark problems available in OR-library and then we compare it with non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II). Computational results show that pareto optimal BBEDA provides better result and better convergence than NSGA-II.",

        "authors": "Kim, HT and Ahn, CW",
        "description": "This paper presents a new grammatical evolution (GE) that generates automatic program under favor of probabilistic context-free grammar. A population of individuals is evolved under genotypic integer strings and a mapping process is utilized to translate from genotype (i.e., integer string) to phenotype (i.e., complete program). To efficiently handle this process, unlike the standard GE that employs a simple modulo function, the probability concept is introduced to context-free grammar, thereby choosing production rules according to assigned probabilities. Moreover, any crossover and mutation are not employed for generating new individuals. Instead, along the lines of estimation of distribution algorithms that perform search using a probabilistic model of superior individuals, a new population is created/evolved from probabilistic relationship between production rules. A comparative study on the standard GE and the proposed GE is conducted; the performance achieved by the both methods is comparable. Also, the experimental results firmly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

        "authors": "Brownlee, AEI, McCall, JAW and Christie, LA",
        "description": "Metaheuristics assume some kind of coherence between decision and objective spaces. Estimation of Distribution algorithms approach this by constructing an explicit probabilistic model of high fitness solutions, the structure of which is intended to reflect the structure of the problem. In this context, \"structure\" means the dependencies or interactions between problem variables in a probabilistic graphical model. There are many approaches to discovering these dependencies, and existing work has already shown that often these approaches discover \"unnecessary\" elements of structure - that is, elements which are not needed to correctly rank solutions. This work performs an exhaustive analysis of all 2 and 3 bit problems, grouped into classes based on mononotic invariance. It is shown in [1] that each class has a minimal Walsh structure that can be used to solve the problem. We compare the structure discovered by different structure learning approaches to the minimal Walsh structure for each class, with summaries of which interactions are (in) correctly identified. Our analysis reveals a large number of symmetries that may be used to simplify problem solving. We show that negative selection can result in improved coherence between discovered and necessary structure, and conclude with some directions for a general programme of study building on this work.",

        "authors": "Chen, SH",
        "description": "Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) have been used to solve numerous hard problems. However, their use with in-group optimization problems has not been discussed extensively in the literature. A well-known in-group optimization problem is the multiple traveling salesmen problem (mTSP), which involves simultaneous assignment and sequencing procedures and are shown in different forms. This paper presents a new algorithm, named EDA(MLA), which is based on self-guided genetic algorithm with a minimum loading assignment (MLA) rule. This strategy uses the transformed-based encoding approach instead of direct encoding. The solution space of the proposed method is only n!. We compare the proposed algorithm against the optimal direct encoding technique, the two-part encoding genetic algorithm, and, in experiments on 34 TSP instances drawn from the TSPLIB, find that its solution space is n! ((n-1)(m-1)). The scale of the experiments exceeded that presented in prior studies. The results show that the proposed algorithm was superior to the two-part encoding genetic algorithmin terms of minimizing the total traveling distance. Notably, the proposed algorithm did not cause a longer traveling distance when the number of salesmen was increased from 3 to 10. The results suggest that EDA researchers should employ the MLA rule instead of direct encoding in their proposed algorithms.",
