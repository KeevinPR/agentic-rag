Compared with classical methods, MOEAs are more suitable for solving MOPs for the following reasons: (i) multiple solutions can be found in a single run of a MOEA; (ii) a good spread of the nondominated solutions can be reached; and (iii) a MOEA is less susceptible to the shape or continuity of the Pareto-optimal front. Due to the conflicting relationships between objectives, it is unlikely to find such a solution that optimizes all objectives simultaneously. In practice, it is a hard task to find all nondominated solutions when, as is often the case, the number of Pareto-optimal solutions is huge or even infinite. Therefore, when applying an evolutionary algorithm to MOPs, two major issues should be addressed:\n\n- The resultant nondominated front should be as close to the Pareto-optimal front as possible (convergence);\n- The nondominated solutions should be distributed as uniformly (in most cases) and widely along the Pareto-optimal front as possible (diversity).",

For instance, using global positioning systems the whereabouts of trucks or goods in general can be tracked 24 hours a day. Using global communication, new instructions for moving the goods can be issued at any time.

The EDAs employ the probabilistic models to reproduce offspring from parents, instead of genetic operators such as crossovers and mutations. Both of continuous and discrete problems are examined in EDA studies [1], [2], [3]. They have shown the effectiveness of the EDAs in these problem domains. A few researches, however, are found in their extensions to other problem domain [4].\n\nAs computational resources are increasing, graph-related problems, which solutions are represented by graphs, draw increasing attention. Since evolutionary algorithms can cope with various problems because of the flexibility of the EAs, the graph-related problems are a potential application area of the EAs. The graph-related problems are still time-consuming so that only several EA approaches can be found. For instance, Chicano and Alba propose ACOhg (Ant Colony optimization for huge graphs) for model verification [5], [6]. McDermott and O'Reilly employ graphs for music generation [7]. In addition, the notion of graph is incorporated into evolutionary algorithms [8], [9], [10].\n\nIn this paper, a novel estimation of distribution algorithm with graph kernels is proposed. By using the graph kernels, we can address the difficulties, explained in section II-A, in which we apply evolutionary algorithms to solve the graphrelated problems. The individual representation in the proposed method is a graph so that we expect that the proposed method can apply any sorts of the graph-related problems. In order to estimate the distributions of graphs, we employ a kernel density function with the graph kernels.",

The feature vector is the low-dimensional representation of geological parameter fields after using the reparameterization method, while production data are the simulation results of historical period. In addition, we design a log-transformation-based windowed normalization (LTWN) method for the production data, which can enhance the learnability and features of production data.

Firstly, a scheduling problem domain of reentrant hybrid flow shop is described, and then, a mathematical programming model is constructed with an objective of minimizing total weighted completion time. Then, a hybrid differential evolution (DE) algorithm with estimation of distribution algorithm using an ensemble model (eEDA), named DE-eEDA, is proposed to solve the problem. DEeEDA incorporates the global statistical information collected from an ensemble probability model into DE. Finally, simulation experiments of different problem scales are carried out to analyze the proposed algorithm. Results indicate that the proposed algorithm can obtain satisfactory solutions within a short time.\n\nA new kind of manufacturing workshop called reentrant workshop has caused more and more concern recently. The characteristic of a reentrant shop is that a job visits certain stages more than once, which is found in many industries, especially in semiconductor manufacturing enterprises. In semiconductor manufacturing systems, a wafer needs to be processed in successive stages layer-by-layer for several times. This manufacturing process can be regarded as a reentrant hybrid flow shop (RHFS) problem. In a RHFS, all jobs have the same routing over the machines of the shop and the same sequence is traversed several times to complete the jobs and there is more than one machine in at least one station [1].",

When the original dimensions are projected to the latent subspace, those dimensions with larger projected value make more contribution to the optimization process.

In general, the more BSs are to be set up, the higher their powers and antenna heights are used, the larger the service area will be covered and the better the quality of service is, but the higher cost the network incurs.\n\nThe design of a cellular system can thus be treated as a multi-criteria optimization problem.

Then, subEDAs + RP, subEDAs + MVSH and subEDAs + MVDHL are tested on several benchmark functions and their algorithmic results are compared with those obtained by EDAs.

One alternative in such cases is the combination of those metaheuristics that have proven to be the best contenders, or that benefit from different search strategies. The study of possible ways to combine metaheuristics is therefore an important topic in optimization (Kovačević et al. 1999; Brimberg et al. 2000; Andreatta and Ribeiro 2002; Rodríguez et al. 2003).\n\nVariable neighborhood search (VNS) (Mladenović 1995; Mladenović and Hansen 1997) is a metaheuristic based on systematically changing the neighborhood structure within a search.

Hence, it is essential to have an optimized plan for the routing of the machines to complete agricultural field operations [1]. Figure 1 illustrates the layout of an agricultural field. The field has several established tracks with symmetrically planted crops. These tracks can be traversed by both agricultural machines and harvesters.\n\nIn Fig. 1, the headland areas North and South of the field refer to the headland area (crop-free) where machines perform maneuvers to go to the next track. The farmer needs to determine which sequence of tracks will cover the shortest distance, thereby reducing the overall cost.

A number of problem instances are generated based on the benchmark instances of static capacitated arc routing problem with time window considering the aforementioned four uncertain factors. To tackle this new challenging problem, we adapt a state-of-the-art algorithm for solving uncertain capacitated arc routing problem, an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) with a stochastic local search, to find robust solutions. Another algorithm, a memetic algorithm with extended neighborhood search, is also adapted as a baseline solution algorithm to this challenging problems. Our experimental results indicate that our EDA-based algorithm is effective in finding robust solutions to uncertain capacitated arc routing problems with time window.",

In this paper, we introduce the affinity propagation EDA (AffEDA) which learns a marginal product model by clustering a matrix of mutual information learned from the data using a very efficient message-passing algorithm known as affinity propagation. The introduced algorithm is tested on a set of binary and nonbinary decomposable functions and using a hard combinatorial class of problem known as the HP protein model. The results show that the algorithm is a very efficient alternative to other EDAs that use marginal product model factorizations such as the extended compact genetic algorithm (ECGA) and improves the quality of the results achieved by ECGA when the cardinality of the variables is increased.\n\nEDAs mainly differ in the class of probabilistic models used and the methods applied to learn and sample these models. In general, simple models are easy to learn and sample, but their capacity to represent complex interactions is limited. On the other hand, more complex models can represent higher-order interactions between the variables but, in most of the cases, a substantial amount of computational time and memory are required to learn these models.",
